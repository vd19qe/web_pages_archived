Instead, another 9,500 residents here lost their employment between April and mid-May. More than three-quarters of those were in the services sector that includes tourism, accommodation and food services. Since February, more than 31,000 people across Niagara have been left without work, according to the Statistics Canada survey that shows the effect of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. “We’re really starting to see the impacts of this on the youth workforce as well,” said Adam Durrant, operations and research manager for the Niagara Workforce Planning Board. “We are at 32.3 per cent youth unemployment right now (for people between the ages of 15 and 25) … it was 12.1 per cent” at this time last year. While the national unemployment rate rose to 13.7 per cent — the highest since 1976 — the country did get back 289,600 of the jobs lost during the COVID-19 outbreak. Niagara’s seasonally adjusted rate was 12.6 per cent, up from 9.9 per cent in April. Across Ontario, more than 47,000 people regained their employment last month, mostly in manufacturing and construction. Durrant said much of that is likely due to the province allowing more construction work to restart, and that the manufacturing sector has been busy producing personal protective equipment for health-care workers. Data from his office and others across the province will be used by different levels of government to plot an economic recovery. Friday’s report does present the truest picture yet of Niagara’s employment situation. The region’s data is measured on a three-month rolling average, so previous reports from March and April were partly skewed by information from before the pandemic forced businesses to close. By covering the period from mid-March to mid-May, this is the first survey taken entirely during COVID-19. So while some of the numbers look worse than in previous months, it’s not necessarily so, said Durrant. In Niagara, two areas — food and accommodations, and information, culture and recreation — bore the brunt of job losses. “Employment in (information, culture and rec) is down by 52 per cent” since February, said Durrant. “And accommodation and food services is down 44 per cent in those three months. “That’s 17,000 people who were employed in February that are not employed in May, and February is largely the slow season for accommodation and tourism. That’s the off-peak time.” Across Canada, Statscan found that of the 290,000 people who returned to work, just over 70 per cent were male. And in Ontario, even among people who were still employed nearly one quarter were working less than half their usual hours. “We’re seeing dramatic changes across the board as to how business is done,” said Durrant. “Last count Statscan did, they had 6.8 million people in Canada working from home. That’s 40 per cent of the Canadian workforce, roughly, is working from home now amid pushing 15 per cent unemployment.

In a Monday interview, Dr. Mustafa Hirji said he remains concerned too many Niagara residents are not practising effective infection control, including wearing masks, he said an order to require masks to be worn in businesses is better left to municipal governments. ""I don't think the medical officer of health or the public health department should be issuing orders that determine how the economy operates,"" said Hirji. ""I think that is something that can be done with a bylaw passed by elected officials."" A recent study by Texas A&M University, the University of Texas at Austin, University of California and California Institute of Technology compared transmission of the virus and preventative measures in New York City and Italy, where mask-wearing became mandatory part way through the pandemic. They found that after masks were required, New York reduced infections by 66,000 from April 17 to May 9. In Italy, they were reduced by 78,000 from April 6 to May 9. ""What we believe is that if you impose the use of face masks and you do it properly, it is potentially a way to control the pandemic,"" said Mario Molina, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, who shared the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1995. ""It is extremely clear that it is much more important to make the use of masks mandatory than just isolating and social distancing, (because) you can decrease cases much more efficiently."" Hirji said the evidence of the efficacy of face coverings has been steadily growing since the pandemic began. That is why, he said, more recent public health guidance changed regarding masks, and how the public is asked to wear them whenever physical distancing is difficult. However, he said no randomized, controlled studies on the ability of masks to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus have been completed. Without that kind of compelling evidence, Hirji said he would be reluctant to issue the type of order handed down by his counterpart in Guelph, who made masks mandatory for customers and staff in businesses. Hirji said while he has the authority to issue such an order, he regards that power to be best applied to specific circumstances, such as an outbreak at a nursing home. A society-wide order, he said, should come from elected officials that would draw on medical advice, rather than from appointed officials like himself. St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik, however, said he was ""frustrated"" with Hirji's position, noting the Guelph medical officer of health has no such issues in making the masking order. He also said Niagara's patchwork of municipal councils would make it difficult to ensure such an order was in place across the region without the public health department's authority. ""I'm disappointed we wouldn't be hearing something a little stronger from our own director of public health about the wearing of masks. It would be kind of silly if we've been following the same directions as a region for three months and all of a sudden, if you go to Niagara-on-the-Lake you don't have to wear a mask but if you go to Thorold you have to wear a mask but if you go to Pelham you don't have to wear a mask,"" Sendzik said. ""We've been asked as politicians to follow public health since the outbreak of COVID and now 'it's politicians should make these decisions'. That's kind of a cop out."" Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati meanwhile, said that unless the province makes wearing a mask mandatory, the city won't force businesses to require them. ""But we're encouraging businesses to make masks available, to encourage employees to wear masks when they can't physically distance, the exact same things the province is saying,"" said Diodati, adding the tourism industry has launched of the SafeToPlay.ca program which outlines measures designed to reduce contact and ensure physical distancing. - Niagara encouraging face masks on buses - How do I stay safe as Ontario reopens?

Rewbury, who works in the food services industry, can often be found at Taris on the Water in downtown Welland, stopping by on a regular basis ever since the restaurant overlooking the Welland Recreational Canal opened its doors five years ago. But when the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, prompted a provincewide lockdown in March, the restaurant had to close its doors. And like other restaurants across the province, Taris can now open up its patio for dine-in service. Rewbury is thrilled. “I’m so excited,” she said, “This is such a great spot in Welland. It’s always been a great experience when I come here. It’s sensational food.” For Taris owners Tom and Leda Laborie, those words were music to their ears. “It has been phenomenal, we’re just so grateful that all of our customers have come back to support us,” Tom said. Not that the past few months have been easy for Taris, which officially reopened its patio on June 24, a few days after Niagara was allowed to enter Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan. The restaurant survived with takeout service but it wasn’t the same as greeting guests at the West Main Street restaurant on a daily basis. The couple had planned to celebrate the eatery’s fifth anniversary in May but that was scrubbed. And they know they’re not out of the woods yet. “Now it’s day by day,” Tom said. “We don’t know. What’s the government going to do tomorrow? What’s corona going to do tomorrow?” For now, the couple is operating the patio at about 50 per cent capacity. Normally able to seat 65 patrons, capacity has been capped at 36. On the bright side, the couple managed to retain jobs for all staff and, in fact, as the result of heightened cleaning protocols, have added two positions. “There is more to do,” Leda said. “Somebody always has to be around cleaning.” Protocols include staff wearing face masks and tables being sanitized between seatings. Additionally, hand sanitizer is available and customers also have their temperatures checked before entry. The feedback from customers has been positive, Leda said. “Everybody seems to be happy just to get out.” It’s a similar story at M.T. Bellies on Niagara Street, said owner John Clark. “It’s been great having people back in the seats and have a sense of normality again.” Clark closed up shop when the province went into lockdown in mid-March but decided to offer takeout service beginning Good Friday, April 10.

It was no easy task. We started scaling up, one to two to three to five days a week. It has been a tough few months.” The restaurant has managed to make it this far thanks to things like the federal wage subsidy, which meant employees unable to work still received 75 per cent of their salaries. “Without the wage subsidy, we probably wouldn’t have been doing it,” Clark said. But as soon as the winds began to blow that regions across the province would be entering Stage 2, Clark and his staff began to look to how patio service would work. Capacity was set at 18 tables. So far, business has been pretty brisk. “Eighteen tables go pretty quick,” Clark said. Once word got out that the patio had been opened, it was clear people were anxious to have a night out and a meal, he said. “The phone was blowing up about 10 minutes with calls from friends and guests. We’re just entering Week 2 and it’s been very busy.” Originally, the restaurant set a two-hour time limit for customers in order to allow for as many patrons as possible. “We didn’t want to rush anyone out of here,” Clark said, adding the time limit has since been lowered to 90 minutes as most customers were staying less than that amount of time. “Our guests have been very understanding with what’s been going on.” Precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of patrons, he said. Some of the protocols in place include the availability of hand sanitizers, physical distancing markers and directional arrows on the floor to control the flow of traffic and help maintain separation between staff and customers. Additionally, the restaurant is employing single-use paper menus. A digital version can be accessed by simply scanning a bar code at the host/hostess station. And, as is the case with Taris, all staff wear face masks. “It has been nothing but positive vibes,” Clark said. “We’ve found customers have been tipping more. It’s like customers are giving us little raises. I think people are genuinely happy to be able to come, sit down have a meal and be served.” SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

But there are “no concerns” when it comes to social distancing at the terminal, Steve Zorbas, the city’s corporate services general manager, said Thursday. He said there are “no plans” for a new venue, but the option of increasing hours of operation is expected to be explored by staff. Since June 26, the transit building has been a place for people to beat the heat, while still serving bus riders. “As it stands, it looks like everybody has been OK with it,” said Ward 3 Coun. John Chiocchio. The building is open because transit is running, but a different venue might be difficult to relocate to due to citywide closures, he said. “It makes sense to be there, now. But, he added, “We may have to look at something that’s a little bigger,” suggesting consideration of the buildings at market square or Welland Tennis Club on Hooker Street. During extreme heat in 2019, city hall was used as a cooling station, but it has been closed to the public because of the pandemic since mid-March. One concern Chiocchio said has been raised is that washrooms are open to people using the site as a cooling station, but not to transit riders. Welland resident Larry Jeffries was at the terminal Thursday about noon after having tea with his brother at Merritt Park and before heading to an appointment at nearby Oak Place. Aware the transit building was being offered as a cooling station, he sat there to escape the sun before it was time to head across the street. “I just thought I’d come over here and sit in the air conditioning,” he said. Transit staff were busy making sure the nearly 10 people inside the building at that time were following rules. Jeffries was sitting with another woman on a bench but was told to move to another spot because they were not from the same household. There is signage that says “one person per bench” and that only family members can sit together. Staff were also telling people to keep two metres apart. Hope Centre executive director Jon Braithwaite said he is “looking forward to a time, post-COVID, that there are many more options available for those in need of relief from extreme weather.” The King Street centre has been handing out bottled water at its takeout lunch program. Braithwaite said up to 80 bottles are provided daily and that donations of bottled water would be appreciated. “As an organization that is committed to providing supports to those in our community most vulnerable, extreme weather is always a concern,” he said.

Environment Canada meteorologist David Phillips said temperatures in Niagara have consistently been above average for the past 13 days, with very little precipitation, and although the forecast calls for showers this weekend they likely won’t provide the rainfall farmers need — or do much to reduce the heat. While Phillips said Niagara has yet to break any temperature records this summer, he said the persistent heat is significant. “We have already had in the Niagara area about 13 days where the temperature has been above 30 C ... And we’re not even into the dog days of summer yet,” he said. Normal high temperatures in early July are about 27 C. “Last summer, we probably only had four or five of those days,” Phillips said. The weekend forecast calls for a high of 27 C on Saturday, but Phillips said that won’t provide much relief from the heat. And by the middle of next week, the temperature is expected to be back above 30 C. Phillips expects more of the same in weeks to come. “We’ll be counting the number of days above 30 C right up until Labour Day,” he said. Phillips said even overnight temperatures have remained in the high 20s, “and that becomes more of a health issue.” “Morning, noon and night we can’t escape it,” he said. Municipalities throughout Niagara have opened venues where people can escape the heat. The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre is open 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. while other facilities and churches, such as Silver Spire, are running drop-in centres. Niagara Falls has opened two cooling centres, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., at Gale Centre and the LaMarsh Room at the Victoria Avenue public library branch. In Welland, people can visit the transit terminal on East Main Street from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. While those initiatives help get people out of the heat, Start Me Up Niagara executive director Susan Venditti said they don’t replace locations that people would typically visit that have been closed due to the pandemic. “Your normal places, they’re definitely missed,” she said.

They are not doing well. People need places to go and places to live.” Niagara’s farmers are starting to worry, too. “You’re seeing crops are suffering,” Phillips said. “There are some areas in Toronto, for example, where in the last 20 days they’ve had a thimble full of rain … The ground is drying out and crops are beginning to feel it.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Beachgoers flock to Port Colborne’s Nickel Beach Jul. 03, 2020 Niagara Region Photo: Relief from the heat — and lockdown Jul. 02, 2020 Niagara Region Welland Transit terminal to act as cooling station Jun. 30, 2020 Niagara Region Niagara Falls’ outdoor swimming pools now open Jul. 01, 2020 Since May, Niagara has only had about 40 per cent of the precipitation it typically receives in that time period, Phillips said. Niagara Association of Agriculture vice-president Albert Witteveen said local farms remain in “pretty good shape” despite the minimal rainfall. He said the wheat harvest is days away and farmers are expecting a good yield. He said local strawberries are more flavourful this year because the region has not experienced excessive rainfall. But other crops “probably need an inch or two of rain.” “We’re all hoping for that rain in the next week or two. Hopefully, we will see rain this month and things will just go to town again,” said Witteveen, a regional councillor for West Lincoln. While there are showers in the forecast for the days ahead, Phillips said “it’s not the rescue rains we need.” “It won’t be enough to correct the situation. It might be enough to keep the dust down and to wet the ground.” Allan Benner is a St. Catharines-based reporter with the Standard.

Both my parents reside at Lundy Manor and I would like to offer another perspective. Before I do this, let me first acknowledge the loss suffered by the families of Lundy Manor. It is tragic and unbearable. None of what follows is intended to minimize that loss. What is lost in the criticism of how owners of long-term care facilities navigated their operations through a pandemic is an acknowledgement of the men and women who showed up every day and tried their best to care for the residents in an unprecedented environment. What we witnessed were dedicated professionals who worked tirelessly and put their own health, and the health of their families, at risk. They continued to do this despite public criticism. Many of these men and women fell ill with the virus and when they recovered, ran back into the burning building to rejoin their colleagues. Not only did they show up, but they did so with humanity and compassion that repeatedly moved us. Whether it was helping my father who suffers from Alzheimer’s figure out how to FaceTime his grandchildren or care for my mother in the final days of her life so she could die with dignity, what was apparent to us, is the staff cares and the loss and suffering of the residents affects them.

David NowakToronto Region must curb its spending Re: Regional council told by Niagara’s business leaders to tighten its belt in wake of pandemic, June 26 According to the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario employers and employees in the Niagara Region are among the hardest hit in Ontario. It's a confirmation of Spencer Fox's presentation to regional council and for the absolute need for council to get serious about dealing with its budget. The unwillingness of regional politicians and bureaucrats to downsize to create badly needed tax relief for Niagara taxpayers is a problem. While many in the private sector are fighting for survival, the Region hasn't been been doing anything to mitigate the incredible financial pressuresith. Frustration among Niagara residents about the Region's growing bureaucracy and wasteful spending is falling on deaf ears. The call to reduce regional government has been out there for quite some time. The police budget should be the first to see cuts. For Coun. Robert Foster to dismiss Mr Fox's message reflects the ignorance that many councillors seem have towards the private sector. The Region and the municipalities need to curb their spending. Nice words and good intentions are not good enough. Rob JanssenLincoln Offer of business expertise appreciated Spencer Fox is president of E.S. Fox Ltd., a company that has been in business in the Niagara region for over 60 years. He has gathered a number of business leaders to offer help to our politicians in the wake of the pandemic. “Consider using us as your business consultants,” he said in an open letter to council. Fox expressed concern tax revenues are going to be reduced as many businesses will be gone or unable to recover to their former size. . What a novel idea and we the tax-paying public will not have another bill for expensive advisory commissions. Thank you, Mr. Fox and friends, for your invaluable expertise. Our leaders are going to need all the help they can get. Paul D. Scott Welland Letters Welcome We welcome letters from our readers.

Market-goers were in line before the official 8 a.m. opening, eager to get back to shopping for local fruit, vegetables and other items at the market, closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’ve been waiting for it to open. We like to support all of the local producers … so it’s great to come out,” said Neil Freeman. The couple are regulars at the market and said they waited in line 15 to 20 minutes before going around to the eight vendors at Market Square. Also waiting in line once the market opened was Kim Doros. “I’m a frequent market-goer … I come throughout the season,” said Doros, who waited for about 15 minutes. She goes to the market for organic food. “I’m glad to see it reopened. I’d like to see it expanded,” she said. Richard Dalton, Welland’s manager of recreation and culture, said expanding the farmers market will take time. “Public health has us doing a lot of due diligence,” said Dalton from the market Saturday morning. When The Tribune was interviewing Dalton, a public health inspector arrived and looked over the market and it setup. “Our staff did a nice job of preparing and setting up … things went smoothly.” Dalton said there were restrictions on how many people could be inside the market at one time and how they moved through it. With eight vendors, the city was allowing one person, couple or group in per vendor. The set up allowed social distancing and a smooth flow of one-way pedestrian traffic.

This is according to human resources manager Andrea Daisley, who said Friday that a “potential return to work date has not been established at this time” for them. There are 18 part-time employees that remain out of work, said Daisley. Steve Leavitt, national staff representative for Canadian Union of Public Employees, represents unionized city workers in Welland. He told The Tribune there are five CUPE members who have been sitting at home watching their phones and email accounts since a city-wide shutdown of programming and facilities. Three employees from the recreation and culture division, as well as a traffic technician and parking-bylaw officer are currently not working. On July 6, the city’s recreation and culture department’s Facebook page posted that volunteers were being sought to assist with the farmers market, which will resume operations with a soft opening Saturday. Asked if this is unsettling, he said it depends on what type of tasks the volunteers are given. “It’s always a concern,” he said Friday. “I don’t know what they’ll be doing in particular. If they’re doing the work of the bargaining unit, that’s going to be an issue for us,” said Leavitt. One unionized full-time worker is on the job overseeing the operation of the farmers market, as well as a market co-ordinator. “If there are any issues with volunteers doing work we should be doing, she will let us know,” said Leavitt. Other municipal employers in Niagara have redeployed staff to other responsibilities that were not part of their daily routine before COVID-19. Welland could do the same, he said. “They’ve done whatever they can to keep people employed, even if it’s not the job they normally do,” said Leavitt, using Niagara Region bringing out-of-work employees back to handle COVID-19 screenings at long-term care homes as an example. Finding new tasks for people has already been discussed with the city, which he believes could be applied to CUPE Local 1115 members employed with the local government. “We’ve suggested that to the city, but with not much luck, unfortunately,” said Leavitt. Corporate Services general manager Steve Zorbas said Friday afternoon he did not have a breakdown of what departments the 15 laid-off staff are from. Out of the more than 100 people given notice in April, approximately 70 per cent of them are unionized, said Zorbas, adding that volunteers will not be taking on tasks they shouldn’t be and that the two individuals behind preparations and operation of Saturday’s market reopening will be able to cover the necessary work. “For this weekend, it’s all we require,” said Zorbas, unsure of how many city employees would be at the market on a typical weekend before COVID-19 arrived.

The city “may increase staffing” as services and programming are restored, and provincial government restrictions are loosened. “We continue to review this on a weekly basis,” said Zorbas.

Zorbas said there are “no timelines established” for when the facility might reopen. He said the arena on King Street being put back in service will be discussed in the “coming weeks” by the municipality’s corporate leadership team. A total of 15-full time unionized employees were told early April that their services were not required when the COVID-19 pandemic took over. This was in addition to 12 full-time transit drivers, 17 full-time public works casuals, and 23 part-time staff, which included transit operators, transit terminal clerks, and recreation staff. Welland Public Library issued temporary layoff notices to 22 part-time workers, as well as eight full-time unionized library staff.

The year-round weekly event has been shut down since mid-March, but will start serving again this weekend from 8 a.m. to noon, said a news release from the City of Welland. The market will be “managed with strict protocols” to minimize the spread of COVID-19, offer a small group of vendors Saturday, and “grow accordingly” throughout the summer, said the city. Vendors will be set up in outdoor, designated stalls, located in the courtyard between the market square buildings. Patrons will enter on the east side of the market and city staff will be present to monitor and manage the number of customers entering. People are encouraged to wear face coverings for public safety. Hand sanitizer will be available. The market has been an event in the city for 113 years.

""We're having conversations on when we think it would be appropriate to reopen the Welland Farmers Market,"" the city's chief administrative officer, Gary Long, said Tuesday. The decision to start welcoming patrons back to the historic Saturday market in downtown Welland will be based on public health information, he said. City staff are looking at what a ""new and different"" market may involve. There are two buildings where several indoor vendors set up. Will they be kept outside? Will they be required to serve customers who are filed inside one at a time? ""These are all scenarios and configurations staff are looking at as we speak,"" said Long. He said Welland is watching what other municipalities are doing to prepare to reopen. In early April, the city decided its facilities will remain closed or events cancelled until June 30. It was said at that time that things could possibly start to return to normal by July 6. ""We were looking into the crystal ball and we may have to adjust the time frame even further, depending on where we're at a month from now,"" said Long. ""We certainly aren't going to commit to a date or time frame at this point in time."" More information on Port Colborne's Friday farmers market and its plans for 2020 will be available Wednesday, said the city's corporate communications officer, Michelle Idzenga. Marc MacDonald, spokesman for the Town of Pelham, said his municipality is planning to open its Thursday farm market June 11. The associated supper market, a popular event held on the same evenings, is on hold, but not officially cancelled. MacDonald said public health guidelines from the province will determine whether the supper market serves the public in 2020. The St. Catharines farmers market has set this Saturday as its opening date. There will be 16 vendors at the market selling produce only. The city's director of community, recreation and culture services, Phil Cristi said one customer per vendor will be allowed in the market and staff will be doing head counts at the entrance and exit. Vendors and shoppers will be required to wear a facial covering. Hand-washing stations will be set up at the entrance and exit and there will be one-way traffic flow through the market building downtown. — with files from Karena Walter - St. Catharines to reopen farmers market Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Welland city hall reopens for marriage licences KD By Kris DubeThe Welland Tribune Mon., July 13, 2020timer1 min. read The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t getting in the way of love in Welland anymore. Since mid-March, city facilities have been closed to the public. But starting Wednesday, the local government will open civic square to couples seeking marriage licenses. Appointments are required and can be booked between 9 a.m. and noon on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, according to a news release from the municipality. “The City of Welland is implementing safety protocols in public facilities, which include physical distancing, workplace sanitization, and pre-screening of applicants before appointments to increase appointment efficiency,” it said. Civic square will remain closed to the public except for the issuance of marriage licences or other pre-arranged appointments. Niagara residents who wish to obtain a marriage licence are required to book an appointment with the clerk’s department at 905-735-1700, ext. 0, or by emailing marriage@welland.ca. City clerk Tara Stephens said there have been “some inquiries” from the public regarding marriage licenses during the pandemic. The spring and summer months “tend to be busier,” she said, noting an average of 20 to 40 licenses are signed during this time of year. In what she called the off-season, she said about 10 to 20 licenses are usually provided.

Premier Doug Ford said most of Ontario would enter stage three of the framework for reopening on Friday as new coronavirus cases remain low, but the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest have to wait a week. “We need just a little more time,” Ford said Monday. Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and outdoor playgrounds can open in Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay and a slew of other regions. Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Windsor-Essex and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening. Ford suggested those regions could open up as early as July 24, so long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, gives him the green light. That’s the same day Ontario’s state of emergency, in place since March 17, is due expire after yet another extension was granted Monday by MPPs. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said as of July 27, all child-care centres across Ontario can open with up to 15 kids per room. Lecce said that should enable them to be at 90 per cent capacity, meaning more parents can get back to work. He added schools could also reopen for students in September, although that situation remains fluid. “We will be cautious, methodical and focused on safety to get this right, because keeping your child safe is what matters most,” he said. “I’ll be sharing more details soon about the return to school plan, which I know is top of mind for many parents around the province. We are confident in this plan to enable parents to return to work while having the peace of mind that their children are cared for.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner questioned the Progressive Conservative government’s strategy. “Securing a safe place for kids to be Monday to Friday should be a higher priority than allowing people to crowd into bars and restaurants,” said Schreiner. “We are still without a sound plan for education or new funding for child-care providers to implement COVID-19 safety protocols.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Tories need to offer more help for small businesses struggling in the pandemic, like subsidies for Plexiglas barriers and personal protective equipment for workers. “As we prepare to move into a new stage of our economic reopening, we must remember that small businesses across the province are struggling because Doug Ford didn’t provide the kind of direct support needed to keep Main Street healthy and vibrant,” said Horwath. The premier insisted Ontario has learned lessons from the U.S., where reopening businesses and attractions too quickly has led to a surge in cases. “I see these numbers from Florida and they’re staggering — 15,000 people that contracted COVID in a day, that is scary. But we’re being pretty vigilant. We aren’t rushing into anything,” said Ford. After Friday, the places in stage three can have indoor gatherings of up to 50 people, while in stage two the limit remains at 10.

However, some restrictions will remain. Amusement parks and water parks will not be allowed to open. Nor will buffet restaurants, night clubs, overnight camps for children, private karaoke rooms, saunas, bath houses, oxygen bars or table games at casinos. In bars, there will be no dancing and all patrons will need to remain seated inside. For athletes, “prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports is not permitted” in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Concerts, artistic events, theatrical productions, performances and movie theatres can resume with limits. “Performers must maintain physical distancing of two metres from every other person, except from other performers where necessary for purposes of the performance,” the government said. Similarly, “audiences are subject to the number of people that can maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and cannot exceed gathering limits of 50 indoors and 100 outdoors,” it said. “This applies to the entire facility, regardless of the number of theatres or performance stages within the facility.” Ford said amusements parks and multiplex cinemas could make a pitch for exemptions to the rules. “If they come up with a plan, a proper plan that keeps people’s social distanced and in other areas and puts it forward to the chief medical officer and they approve it, then they can open,” he said.

That’s basically how every conversation started,” she said. The call centre on Lincoln Street, Canada’s largest digital acquisition platform for insurance and financial services, announced in April that it was looking to hire 75 new people through online and phone interviews for sales broker positions to add to its 200-employee workforce at the time. Since then, about 50 new people have joined the team and are completing their training virtually from home. A goal of 20 new hires was set for Tuesday’s campaign. Hale said 15 candidates pulled up Tuesday to go over their resume and the company has plans to offer 10 of them a job. Interviews were booked by appointment and two people who were scheduled did not show up, she said. The idea came from Hale seeing another company post on Linkedin early in the COVID-19 pandemic that it was holding a similar event. The uniqueness of the format on Tuesday was enjoyed by the applicants, but also staff who conducted the interviews. “It was exciting on both sides to try something new,” she said. Some people opted to park and then walk up to the two tents where the interviews were taking place. “It is slightly awkward, sitting in your car, turning to the left and talking for 30 minutes,” said Hale. She said the outdoor hiring spree was “successful on all fronts” and that a second one could be held again soon. Resumes were already on file, eliminating the need for any contact or for candidates to bring a paper copy. Successful job seekers will work from home for the first three months and then work from the Welland office, if government restrictions allow it to happen, said Hale.

The St. Catharines resident was one of the many people who applied for a job with Kanetix Ltd. recently and participated Tuesday. “This is ideal compared to going into an office in a closed space,” said Hakimzada as she waited patiently for her turn to shine in her idling SUV ahead of her appointment late Tuesday morning.

That’s causing no shortage of headaches for the township and the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Area, which says the quarry, with its rocky shoreline, is supposed to be limited to only passive uses. But with people who spent months going stir crazy during the COVID-19 lockdown flocking to the NPCA-owned property, known as the Wainfleet Wetlands Conservation Area, both the township and NPCA say steps must be taken in the short-term and long-term to get people to obey the rules. Senior NPCA staff, including chief administrative officer Chandra Sharma, made a virtual presentation to Wainfleet council July 14 regarding collaboration with the township on managing NPCA lands within Wainfleet. Sharma noted her agency, responsible for watershed management protection across Niagara and parts of Hamilton and Haldimand, has a huge presence in Wainfleet: just shy of half of the NPCA’s entire 2,950 hectares of land sits in the township in conservation areas and campgrounds. While 83 per cent of the NPCA’s 1,248 hectares of land in Wainfleet is classified as passive — meaning it’s designed for public uses such as hiking, walking and bird-watching — Sharma said it’s no secret people are using the quarry and surrounding area for things that are not allowed. People are openly swimming, having bonfires, leaving garbage behind and even consuming alcohol, Wainfleet politicians say. The problem of illegal parking by people heading to the quarry or beaches, which council members say was out of control, seems to have improved somewhat since the township dramatically increased parking fines to $100 recently, township staff said at the council meeting. But Sharma said it’s clear current methods to stop people from misbehaving at the quarry aren’t working. “It is obvious our current management practices can’t keep up with demand for green space,” she said. “It is not just Wainfleet, we’re seeing it everywhere.” Coun. Sherri Van Vliet said there are “mass amounts” of people at the quarry at a time when the province still has a ban on large-scale public gatherings due to COVID-19, but said she doesn’t see the NPCA cracking down. “There are hundreds of people barbecuing, they have tents set up for the day, they’re walking up our roads with alcohol in hand,” she said. “I don’t see anybody from the NPCA there policing this. We (Wainfleet township) don’t have the resources to police this.” Sharma assured council her agency is aware of the activities taking place. “Obviously they have increased in the last couple of months since COVID-19 closures,” she said. “People have nowhere to go and the access is easy to these properties. We have never seen these types of issues at this scale or these types of activities. We’re working with town staff to find solutions to those.” Van Vliet said the growth in problems at the quarry has been going on for several years, not just during the pandemic. “People are taking for granted that we have the source of water out there to use,” she said. “What’s happening out there is just unreal.” Mayor Kevin Gibson said he’s seen first-hand the situation at the quarry, and agreed it was building long before the pandemic.

It is a big destination for the peninsula. “It’s like the wild west down there and we really do need to do something and really get at it,” said Gibson.

The summers are getting hotter, and more people are coming.” Council approved a motion calling for staff to work with the NPCA and other stakeholders to develop short- and long-term plans to improve the NPCA’s presence in the township.

Linda Sicoli, economic development officer with Niagara Region, made a presentation at the town’s July 20 council meeting regarding findings of the survey, to which 181 NOTL businesses responded. The Region conducted two surveys across all 12 municipalities in Niagara — one in March and another that closed in early June. The surveys were distributed to about 10,000 businesses. Only 1,382 in the region responded to the second survey, a 13 per cent response rate. All findings were shared with the economic development offices within Niagara, other stakeholders in the region and with upper levels of government. “The survey was recovery-focused and it was looking to determine how businesses were getting support and how they were being impacted,” Sicoli said. Every industry sector and business has experienced a negative impact, Sicoli said, but the tourism sector, which includes accommodation and food services, arts, entertainment, recreation and retail trade, was hit hardest. Of the 181 NOTL businesses that submitted answers to the survey, 66 were in accommodation and food services. Sixty-nine responded saying they had layoffs resulting in 1,343 job losses in the town, 47 per cent were part time and 64 per cent were in accommodation and food services. To date, about $26.49 million has been lost by these NOTL businesses. Just more than 41 per cent of businesses said they are at risk of imminent permanent closure or vulnerable to closure; however, only 143 businesses responded to this question. The remaining merchants were in the categories of sustaining, stable or doing well. A majority of NOTL businesses were using the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, the wage subsidy and the emergency business response benefit, but only six had accessed the rent subsidy which requires the building landlord to apply. A total of 33 businesses were not using any program assistance and 36 per cent felt the programs are insufficient. “Businesses say they will need municipal and regional support moving forward, not only with the deferral of taxes and fees, but also in regard to information, advocacy and promotion,” Sicoli said. With Niagara Region entering Stage 3 of reopening on Friday, 45 per cent of NOTL businesses that responded to the regional survey said they can only operate between 26 and 50 per cent of their capacity when adapting to COVID-19 measures. More than 25 per cent said they could operate between 76 and 100 per cent of capacity. Only 114 businesses responded to this question. Businesses are seeking support primarily focused on planning, creating a digital presence, advocacy, PPE sourcing and further loans. NOTL regional Coun.

Daisley said the city was notified Monday of the positive test result and all staff — inside and outside workers — were informed by memo. The memo said the situation was being monitored closely and the city is maintaining its cleaning schedule and continuing with physical distancing measures. Citing privacy reasons, Daisely was unable to tell the Welland Tribune what department the person works in or how many people that person may have been in contact with before testing positive. “(Niagara Region) Public Health is responsible for contact tracing, and that process was complete. Anyone who needed to be notified was.” Daisley said there are procedures in place if and when a city employee tests positive for COVID-19 and those followed. She said managers would have followed the guidelines in this case. Those guidelines include sending an employee home immediately and who to contact when notified of a positive test result. City staff are working staggered shifts, and there are rigorous cleaning protocols in place to prevent the viruses spread, she said. “We have physical barriers in place in some areas as well as physical distancing,” said Daisley. Mayor Frank Campion said the city is taking things “extremely seriously” when it comes to protecting employees from COVID-19. “We have many measures in places and put in new measures as we work through this and open up our facilities and city hall,” he said, adding that includes ensuring the public is also safe when entering city facilities. Campion, who did not know the positive employee’s identity, said there are ongoing conversations at city hall about the pandemic and staff are highly involved daily. Greg Brady, president of Unifor Local 199 which represents Welland’s outside workers, said some of his members were very concerned when they heard the news. Brady spoke with the city’s human resources department who told him about public health’s contact tracing protocols and that anyone in contact with the employee would have been notified. “None of the city workers that I represent have been contacted through public health. I’m relieved it wasn’t one of our members.” Brady wasn’t shocked to hear of the positive test result and said it was only a matter of time. He believed the city was taking every measure it could to protect its employees. “There are sanitizing stations, all the PPE that’s required and the social distancing aspect as well.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region ‘Our luck may have run out,’ says Hirji as Niagara COVID-19 cases rise Jul. 21, 2020 Niagara Region Niagara residents lost during the COVID-19 pandemic Jul. 16, 2020 Business Some nervousness among Niagara’s economic development leaders as region embarks on Stage 3 Jul. 21, 2020 Steve Leavitt, Canadian Union of Public Employees national staff representative, said the union was told a city employee tested positive. “We don’t know who it is.

But there is one diamond-hard certainty that Dr. Mustafa Hirji knows: given the opportunity, the virus will spread. And it is spreading in Niagara. “It looks like our luck may have run out,” said Hirji, Niagara’s acting medical officer of health, after nine new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the region Tuesday. “That is obviously well above our baseline.” It is not just Tuesday’s case count that has Hirji’s attention. He said over the past few weeks there has been a steady creep in the data, pushing the average daily case count into the mid-single digits rather than the low single digits — including several zero case days. Ten cases were confirmed Saturday, the largest single-day jump in more than a month, further evidence the virus is infecting more people than it was a few weeks ago. “I don’t want to place too much emphasis on only four days of data. I don’t like to look into the crystal ball and make predictions. It could be that in two weeks we will look back and see this as an unusual blip,” he said. “But it is concerning and we are seeing increases in other regions in Ontario, and in other places in the country.” British Columbia, Quebec and Alberta all registered an increase in cases this week. Hirji thinks it is no accident that the rise in cases comes as provinces take the pandemic shackles off the economy. With the reopening, Hirji said, comes greater risk. “That is why I continue to stress physical distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing a mask. Complacency is on the rise, and that can result in more virus spread.” Five of Tuesday’s new cases have no known source of infection, a fact that limits the extent to which contact tracing can identify other possible cases and get people into isolation. There have been 809 COVID-19 cases in Niagara, with 41 of them active. At least 64 Niagara residents with the virus have died. There are no patients being treated for COVID-19 at St. Catharines hospital. Hirji said any expectation that Niagara would achieve zero cases permanently without a vaccine is unrealistic. A rise in cases was expected with more social and economic activity. The question, he said, is about intelligent risk management to keep the case count down at a stable level where that activity can proceed without overwhelming the health-care system. “That is not something I think is being discussed enough,” he said. Whether, or even how, a rise in cases may impact the provincial government’s reopening strategy is not clear. Dr. Hirji said his department is not consulted by the provincial government on reopening decisions. While Niagara’s health department posts the metrics on its website, Hirji said he does not know if the Ministry of Health is using that data. On July 15, Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates wrote a letter to Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott asking for greater transparency as it pertains to the government’s COVID-19 decisions. “While I support the decisions and expert advice Ontario Public Health has provided during this pandemic, I am deeply concerned about the lack of transparency in public health data that has been guiding your ministry’s decision-making process on reopening,” Gates wrote. He has yet to receive a reply. “I’m not saying a region should open or shouldn’t, but I do think the government should show us what the data is. Tell us what the game is so we know how to play it,” Gates said in Tuesday interview. “They should be consulting Dr. Hirji and telling the people of Niagara how they are deciding things.” He said even when the government delayed Niagara’s entry into Stage 2, it was not clear why. “They said it was about the greenhouse outbreak (in St. Catharines) but public health said that was contained. They said they were concerned about the border, but everyone knows the border is closed,” he said. “Show us the data.” Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

If that happens, he hopes it is done on a region-by-region or even city-by-city basis. “If something is happening in Toronto, it should not necessarily mean Niagara has to shut down,” he said. “Even in Niagara there are not new cases in our southern municipalities (Port Colborne, Fort Erie and Wainfleet), so maybe they could be less restrictive than the northern municipalities.” However, those sorts of decisions must be based on what the data is saying about the pandemic locally, Hirji said.

However, if residents and businesses don’t adhere to public health guidelines forcing another shutdown, the region’s economy will likely suffer far greater losses, they fear. “Obviously for businesses and their employees, anything that can help get them back up and operating again is definitely good for them, good for the economy and good for all of us,” said Niagara Region economic development officer Val Kuhns. Blake Landry, Niagara Economic Development’s business research manager and analyst, said the most recent data looking at the impact the pandemic shutdown has had on local businesses was completed a month ago. At that time, Niagara’s businesses reported losses of $7.8 billion, while about 35 per cent of them reported being at risk of permanent closure. Despite the dire impact the shutdown has already had on the region’s economy, Landry remains “nervous” about reopening. “Just today we’re seeing a spike in infections in Ontario,” he said. Ontario reported 203 new cases on Tuesday — nine of them in Niagara. “In my opinion, we haven’t had enough time in Stage 2 to even see the impact. My fear is … are we moving too quickly?” Landry said. “We can’t close up again, economically speaking. I know everyone is struggling, but at the same time if we have to go back to a Stage 1 or Stage 2 again, it’s going to prolong the pain.” Kuhns said the danger posed by another shutdown should add resolve to efforts to avoid it. She said the timing of the Stage 3 announcement was guided by public health, “but the proviso to everything opening up is under restriction.” “Everybody has to be aware that the virus is still out there and we all have to adhere to physical distancing and hand washing and all those things that we’ve been hearing all the way through,” Kuhns said. “There are guidelines as to how businesses can open up. Those will have to be taken into account as well.” Although St. Catharines economic development officer Brian York said there’s “certainly a risk” of being forced back into a shutdown situation if new COVID-19 cases begin to develop, he said the risk can be minimized by following guidelines for reopening — including a city council-approved framework for recovery that aligns with the provincial reopening phases. He said the city’s economic development office created a pandemic recovery strategy, too, identifying 150 actionable items and 40 initiatives. York said the strategy identified 20 potential outcomes, such as growing the economic resiliency and diversity by getting more businesses online versus bricks and mortar and store openings when you couldn’t have the public inside.

It calls for growing the public realm so people can safely distance and still enjoy the downtown,” he said. “We starting to see more patio pickup in the downtown and we’re seeing more people back in a safer.

Diana Huson, chair of Niagara’s planning and economic development committee, said she shares concerns about the potential of future shutdowns. However, she, too, hopes that scenario can be avoided, through initiatives such as a regional mask bylaw being considered at Thursday night’s council meeting. Huson said the toll the virus has taken on a region where 64 people have died “is just heart wrenching,” but the economic impact has been staggering as well — especially for the arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services industries.

Belcastro wants to avoid “confrontation,” but doesn’t anticipate people fighting the requirement approved by the regional government last week. “I don’t think we’ll really have a problem because I think the general public, for the most part, is behind this,” he said Monday. He’s fully supportive of the regionwide bylaw. “It’s going to be a big help,” said Belcastro, adding about five stores at the mall have been enforcing their own “no mask, no service” rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Signage will be placed at the mall’s doors and retailers will continue to make hand sanitizer available, he said. A contravention of the bylaw could result in a fine of up to $1,000. A provincial offences officer from a lower-tier municipality or someone representing the authority of the Region, a public health inspector, and Niagara Regional Police will be responsible for enforcement. Children under the age of five are exempt, as are people with a medical condition, but “no person shall be required to provide proof of any of the exemptions,” states the bylaw. The Region is ordering “every person who is an owner or operator of an enclosed public place shall adopt a policy regarding the wearing of face coverings that prohibits persons from entering, or otherwise remaining, within the enclosed public place unless they are wearing a face covering,” subject to the exemptions that apply. When Seaway Mall reopened June 19 while Niagara was in Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plans, its food court kept cooking but all the tables for people to sit and eat at were removed. With the region moving into Stage 3 last Friday, about 20 tables were put back in place. “The guidelines were pretty strict on where you could put tables and how far they had to be from everything,” said Belcastro, adding that a few benches have also been put back in their spots throughout the mall, which offers about 120 stores and services. “It’s going to take time for people to get back into the habit of shopping. People didn’t want to run to a mall the day they could,” he said about business since Friday. On Monday afternoon, most shoppers were browsing with their faces covered. One of them was Ryan Smutnicki, a Welland resident who agrees with the new rule as a measure to fight a second wave of the coronavirus. “We know how hard it was to get through the first portion of this,” he said. RELATED STORIES Business Seaway Mall, Pen Centre back in business Friday Jun. 16, 2020 Niagara Region Niagara malls getting back to business since green light to reopen Jun. 27, 2020 He supports “anything at this point to prevent us from going back to where we were.” Although Garrett Deschambault was wearing a mask at the mall Monday, he wondered how necessary they are in a place like Seaway Mall, where people aren’t shoulder to shoulder. “I get why they’re doing it to stop it,” he said, but continuing that the new rule could be one too many to follow.

The region entered Stage 3 of the province’s reopening plan last Friday, allowing eateries to offer their menu in dining rooms to a limited number of people, based on capacity and an ability to practise physical distancing. Toni Pizzacalla, owner of Lino’s Pizza in Ridgeway, a popular watering hole near the Crystal Beach border, is keeping staff and customers a priority by not opening the inside of her restaurant, which sat about 60 people before the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, she’s doing well serving takeout and seating guests on her eight-table patio that holds 30 people currently. “Health is more important than the extra money you’re going to make,” she said, adding another factor in the decision is her close proximity to area beaches — hotspots for visitors from the Toronto and Hamilton areas. When will she be comfortable with drinks and food flowing inside? “We’ll wait until we feel right,” she answered, continuing she could bring a small group inside if a heavy rainfall arrives. By law, all patrons must be seated when eating or drinking at establishments. Bars and restaurants must take appropriate measures to ensure physical distancing of at least two metres between patrons from different tables, unless separated by plexiglass or some other impermeable barrier. Justen Mariash, a server at Taris on the Water in Welland, who spoke on behalf of ownership Thursday, said the establishment along the recreational canal also doesn’t want to take any risks. “It’s for the safety of guests and our staff,” he said. “It’s not about money, it’s about keeping everybody safe.” Taris on the Water opened its patio June 24 after closing entirely in March. It chose to not serve takeout and waited to put out tables and umbrellas until four days after the day they were permitted to do so. Seating is available for 52 people outside at 13 tables, about 35 per cent the capacity of what the restaurant welcomed before the pandemic, Mariash said. It has also erected a tent to keep the patio area dry during wet weather. The Spot on Main Street West is taking advantage of the City of Port Colborne’s patio expansion program, making room for 44 outdoor diners on a new area at the rear of the establishment. Owner Christopher Davis said it’s “too risky” to seat people indoors. “If we had people inside, it’d be too much,” he said. Davis said takeout and busy weekends outside should serve the restaurant’s bottom line well enough.

Seated at Lino’s Pizza Thursday afternoon, Gerry Boudreau said he would not sit at an indoor table even if the latest restrictions say it’s OK that he does. “I’m not comfortable with that because the virus is not over yet and can be spread so easily in confined spaces,” said the Niagara Falls resident.

The trendy Port Colborne eatery had only been open for just more than a year when COVID-19 changed everything, including the restaurant and food industry. “Our business was really still in its infancy when everything shut down,” said Rob Carter, who owns and operates the business with his partner Brennon Zwingli. While other businesses were taking a wait-and-see approach to the lockdown, Carter said the business partners wasted no time switching gears. “Very early on, we decided that what others were doing — waiting for things to go back to normal — that might not be for a very long time, and that maybe this was the new normal.” They immediately put together a website and leaned hard into the takeout and delivery markets. They briefly tried a lunch takeout menu, but found dinner to be more popular so they scrapped lunch entirely. After drastically shifting their entire business model, the pair was surprised to find the new system was working even better than the old one. “We used to be open seven days a week, now we’re open just three days a week, and we’re doing more business in those three days than we used to in an entire week,” said Carter. “This whole situation turned into a positive thing for us, but we’re very sensitive to the fact that not everyone is finding themselves in the same situation,” said Carter. “It’s really hard out there for some places, especially retail stores.” While things were going well for the Pie Guys during the lockdown, they wanted to do what they could to help their neighbours. “We want everyone on West Street to do well, we wanted to bring that positive impact we had to the whole street, so we had a promotion where we bundled a gift certificate from a bunch of the West Street shops with one of our pies, and it did really well. We completely sold them all out,” said Carter. “It was a way for us to try and get people in the door of these other shops, because foot traffic is down this summer.” Things might pick up for others with Niagara now in Stage 3 of the provincial reopening process, but Carter said he and Zwingli don’t plan to change things up much. “We’re not going to reopen for indoor eating. We don’t need to, so we’ll keep doing what we’re doing and maybe look at reopening that in the fall,” said Carter, who stressed the Pie Guys couldn’t have been successful without the rest of their team. RELATED STORIES Food & Wine Lions Burger drive-thru coming to St. Davids 6 days ago Council Niagara restaurants, bars now required to keep customer log 7 days ago Restaurants Niagara Parks reopens indoor Table Rock eateries 7 days ago “Me and Brennon are just two people, and we couldn’t have done this without our team, who have been amazing during all this. We’re blessed with six amazing employees, but some of them don’t have daycare or (have) other issues, so we worked with them to find out what they were comfortable with and what they wanted to do, and thankfully it’s all gone very smoothly.” Since reopening with a small patio and walk-in ordering, business is now humming for the Pie Guys once again. Online ordering has started to drop, but Carter said it’s trending alongside an equal increase to in-person orders as more and more people emerge from the lockdown and start going out again.

Not content to sit idly by, the service club has come up with a plan to keep community spirit alive despite the ongoing pandemic: a Friday night barbecue. This weekend, the clubhouse parking lot will turn into a drive-in restaurant where people can order the famous Lions Burgers and LEOs hotdogs. Combos including condiments, fries and bottled water will be sold to go. “It’s almost like back in the day, when you’d drive up to A&W and they’d put a tray on your window,” said event chairman Ed Pittman. A classic Lions Burger combo is $10; the Great Canadian Lions Burger combo (with back bacon) is $12; and the LEOs hotdog combo is $6. “We wanted to keep it affordable for families,” said Pittman, who added the service club’s members will be out volunteering and serving customers who drive up for the takeout-only event. Friday’s barbecue will run 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 1462 York Rd. Pittman said the Lions plan on doing it on a weekly basis. “We wanted to be able to do something for the community. We all got involved in the Lions because we like to serve and give back. This is a way we thought we could do that safely,” he said, crediting fellow Lion Joe Typer with coming up with the idea. With the club’s fundraising efforts sidelined over the past four months, it will be a way for it to raise money for the many causes the Lions Club supports each year including service dogs, eye care initiatives and other community causes including school breakfast programs and capital campaigns. “All of our commitments are covered, but our other resources are starting to dwindle,” said Pittman. RELATED STORIES Council Niagara restaurants, bars now required to keep customer log 7 days ago Niagara Region Restricted: NOTL food truck business not allowed to operate on own property 6 days ago Restaurants Niagara Parks reopens indoor Table Rock eateries 7 days ago This is also a chance for the members to see some of the faces they’re used to interacting with on a regular basis — albeit, now with masks. Pittman said safety precautions will be in place to ensure everyone remains as safe and healthy as possible. “We would only do this if we knew we could do it safely,” he said. Cashless payment options will be available, with the preferred payment by debit or credit card. However, cash will still be accepted.

St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik and Port Colborne Mayor Bill Steele, at last Thursday’s council meeting, used changes Toronto is seeking as a template for Niagara, including requiring sit-down restaurants and bars to keep a log of customers. It is all part of Niagara being in Stage 3 of pandemic recovery. “Where I get concerned is when I see examples in British Columbia,” Sendzik said. “They should have adopted these as part of their restrictions, and they are paying the price for not doing it.” Council passed a bylaw that requires patrons to be seated at all times unless entering, exiting, travelling to and from a washroom, or paying. That differs from provincial regulations that restrict seating to people eating. The bylaw also requires restaurants and bars to maintain a client log with a name and contact information for at least one person in each party. The registry will include the date, check-in and checkout times and table number. The health department can access the information for contact tracing. Establishments must maintain the list for 30 days, after which it can be destroyed. “You only have to look across Canada, and the provinces that moved to Stage 3, head of us, and the problems they have had with an uptick in cases,” Steele said. “In a lot of states, they are allowing greater numbers in their bars and restaurants, and if you look at Florida and California, they are leading the states in daily cases. In California, they had more than 10,000 new cases in one day. “I’m not saying it’s all because of bars and restaurants, but it is a huge issue in the U.S.” In Stage 3, businesses are allowed to resume operations, including indoor service at bars and restaurants. Steele said he didn’t want to see Niagara in the position of “locking down” again. When Premier Doug Ford responded to Toronto’s requirements with the comment, “Go for it,” Steele took his answer as a green light. A letter from the City of Toronto was sent to Niagara Region last week asking for support in getting the premier to add the regulations provincewide. In a memo to council, Dr. Andrea Feller, Niagara’s associate officer of medical health, said unlike other measures that depend heavily on local conditions, settings such as bars and restaurants have similar risks in any area where cases of COVID-19 are occurring. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara’s acting officer of medical health, had said councillors might want to wait and join a co-ordinated effort with Toronto and the other GTA municipalities in pressuring the provincial government for the changes.

When Niagara moved into Stage 3 on Friday, it allowed indoor dining spaces to be used. At Table Rock in Niagara Falls that means indoor eateries are serving up deli sandwiches, classic grill favourites, Niagara craft beers and VQA wines. The upscale Table Rock House Restaurant reopened Sunday for lunch service only, serving up food with a view of the Horseshoe Falls between 11:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. For those looking to enjoy a picnic, the commission has also launched a new picnic program in Niagara-on-the-Lake. In lieu of its typical summer tea served in the afternoons, the McFarland House will be offering gourmet picnic kits featuring sandwiches, freshly baked scones, pastries and cookies all served in a reusable Niagara Parks cooler. While Niagara has moved into Stage 3, the parks commission is still stressing that physical distancing must be practised and masks should be worn indoors or when physical distancing is difficult.

Belcastro wants to avoid “confrontation,” but doesn’t anticipate people fighting the requirement approved by the regional government last week. “I don’t think we’ll really have a problem because I think the general public, for the most part, is behind this,” he said Monday. He’s fully supportive of the regionwide bylaw. “It’s going to be a big help,” said Belcastro, adding about five stores at the mall have been enforcing their own “no mask, no service” rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Signage will be placed at the mall’s doors and retailers will continue to make hand sanitizer available, he said. A contravention of the bylaw could result in a fine of up to $1,000. A provincial offences officer from a lower-tier municipality or someone representing the authority of the Region, a public health inspector, and Niagara Regional Police will be responsible for enforcement. Children under the age of five are exempt, as are people with a medical condition, but “no person shall be required to provide proof of any of the exemptions,” states the bylaw. The Region is ordering “every person who is an owner or operator of an enclosed public place shall adopt a policy regarding the wearing of face coverings that prohibits persons from entering, or otherwise remaining, within the enclosed public place unless they are wearing a face covering,” subject to the exemptions that apply. When Seaway Mall reopened June 19 while Niagara was in Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plans, its food court kept cooking but all the tables for people to sit and eat at were removed. With the region moving into Stage 3 last Friday, about 20 tables were put back in place. “The guidelines were pretty strict on where you could put tables and how far they had to be from everything,” said Belcastro, adding that a few benches have also been put back in their spots throughout the mall, which offers about 120 stores and services. “It’s going to take time for people to get back into the habit of shopping. People didn’t want to run to a mall the day they could,” he said about business since Friday. On Monday afternoon, most shoppers were browsing with their faces covered. One of them was Ryan Smutnicki, a Welland resident who agrees with the new rule as a measure to fight a second wave of the coronavirus. “We know how hard it was to get through the first portion of this,” he said.

As of Friday, wearing a face-covering in indoor public spaces is mandatory as Niagara Region’s mask bylaw is in effect as a measure to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. While public health officials say masks are an effective secondary layer of defense against the spread of COVID-19 when used in conjunction with physical distancing and hand washing, if masks are not worn and handled properly, they can be drastically less useful. Dr. Andrea Feller, associate medical officer of health at Niagara Region, said there are few crucial tips to using and handling masks properly to ensure they will function as an anti-COVID-19 measure. Wash your hands As a general rule, Feller recommends a person wash or sanitize their hands before and after any time they handle their mask. “Wash your hands before you to put on. After you adjust it, wash your hands again. After you take it off, do it again,” Feller said. Wear the right mask Feller says the mask itself needs to cover the nose and mouth, wrap under the chin and loop behind the ears. It should also have as few gaps as possible between your face and the mask. She specifically warns against masks with breathing vents in them. The primary reason for wearing a mask is to block droplets that could contain virus that you may breath out from getting into the air. The vents on most masks seal when the wearer breathes in, protecting them from airborne pollutants. But it opens when the wearer exhales, providing an opportunity for those droplets to escape. Face Shields Face shields offer an extra layer for protection for wearers, but Feller said that on their own they are not as effective as masks and, generally speaking, are not a replacement for them. However, shields can be worn in conjunction with masks. Handling Feller said masks need to be handled properly in order to prevent accidentally infecting yourself. She said the exterior of the mask should not be touched when removing the mask. Remove it by the ear loops and then fold it in half so the outside surfaces is touching itself. “That might sound wrong because you would be touching the inside of the mask, but that is your droplets. You have been touching those inside the mask while you wear it. The aim here is to avoid touching what is on the outside of the mask,” she said. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Rainforest Cafe server sent home for wearing face shield Jul. 31, 2020 Council With regional mask bylaw coming into effect, Fort Erie mayor urges compliance and tolerance Jul. 30, 2020 Niagara Region People under 30 account for most of Niagara’s new COVID-19 cases Jul. 27, 2020 Once removed and folded, she said the mask should be put in a plastic bag rather than a pocket or purse. If it is a disposable mask, throw the bag and mask away. If it is a reusable cloth mask, then wash it. She said not to touch your face after handling a mask until you have washed your hands. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Storage “Please do not store your mask by wearing it under your chin. Or by having it hang off your ear, or by putting it on your car seat or rearview mirror,” Feller said. “The idea here is not to allow whatever might be on the mask to touch everything else.” Whether it is reusable or not, masks should be replaced if they get wet or dirty. The soiled mask should be kept, folded, in the bag until it can be disposed of or washed. Grant LaFleche is a St. Catharines-based investigative reporter with the Standard.

City councillors have been meeting online since late March when the provincial government changed the rules on electronic meetings, allowing remote participation to count toward council quorum. Tuesday, a report from city clerk Tara Stephens recommended amending council’s procedural bylaw to allow elected officials to continue to participate remotely. Councillors questioned whether that meant all future meetings — in-camera, general committee and council — would be virtual. Ward 4 Coun. Tony DiMarco said he prefers to be in council chambers. “Part of our job is being at city hall,” he said. In early June, DiMarco asked the city to find a way to allow councillors back in chambers, closed when public access to Welland Civic Square stopped due to the pandemic. City staff found a way to accommodate up to six councillors to ensure social distancing protocols. Those protocols included allowing only two councillors to sit at the council desk with the other four sitting at tables set up in the public gallery. Both councillors and staff would still use laptops, and headsets, while in chambers. As yet, no councillors have returned to chambers under those protocols. During Tuesday’s meeting, both Stephens and Mayor Frank Campion said the size and configuration of chambers wouldn’t allow for all 12 councillors and staff to return at this point. “We should be thinking proactively on how to solve this problem … how to come back to council chambers,” said Moote. He said city hall is a “big place” and there must be a way to get everyone back. “We should be looking at those options right now.” DiMarco also said the city should be ready ahead of any official OK by the province to resume regular business. For now, though, council will continue to meet virtually and may have the option to continue once the state of emergency is over. Ward 5 Coun. Graham Speck liked the idea of being able to attend remotely, adding it would be a way for those councillors on vacation or at work to take part if they wanted to.

She also said council could change its mind in the future and change the procedural bylaw if it no longer wanted to allow virtual attendance.

But despite his request made on June 9 and the city clerk's office finding a way to accommodate up to six councillors, no one, including the Ward 4 councillor, returned this past Tuesday. City clerk Tara Stephens said only one councillor mentioned possibly sitting in chambers with Mayor Frank Campion, herself and other city staff. In the end, that councillor attended the meeting like the rest, via Zoom. Stephens, in an email, said staff worked to ensure social distancing protocols should any councillor wish to return. Those protocols include allowing only two councillors to sit at the council desk with the other four sitting at tables set up in the public gallery. All staff and councillors attending the meeting in chambers will still use Zoom, despite being physically in the room, and they will not be allowed to use the microphones in place. Headsets will be required for councillors to listen to the meeting to prevent feedback issues through the council chambers sound system. Stephens said councillors wanting to sit in chambers must ask at least 24 hours in advance of a meeting. Those who choose to attend will have to answer a COVID-19 questionnaire each time. They'll enter the civic square through security doors while maintaining social distance from fellow councillors and use a set of stairs to get to council chambers. They have to leave by the same set of stairs. Stephens said no one, including staff, will have access to the anteroom and councillors may only use public washrooms on the second floor. Though allowing councillors back in chambers, Stephens said the city is still encouraging them to stay home. While city councillors didn't return this past Tuesday, a number of the 101 employees temporarily laid off are back to work inside city hall and out on the road. Andrea Daisley, Welland's human resources manager, said six CUPE 1115 members, 12 seasonal workers, eight part-time transit operators and 22 transit drivers remain on layoff. She said many of those 22 transit drivers, who belong to Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1633, are getting some hours in. All full-time Unifor Local 199 workers - that includes parks and recreation staff, water and sewer workers and facility workers, such as those at the arenas - are back to work. Four non-union staff and one firefighter are now back to work as well. Daisley said Welland Public Library staff is gradually recalling staff, but staffing levels at Welland Community Wellness Complex are yet to be determined as all programs and events were cancelled. She said most, if not all, city employees will be back to work by July 6, but that still depends on the next steps with Stage 2 of reopening by the province and the timing of Stage 3. Daily and chief administrative officer Gary Long said there are meetings about workspaces to determine if modifications are required to keep employees safe and ensure physical distancing. Loading...

""Electronic meetings were not a process that I envisioned being a possibility. It's been a learning curve for all of us and it's been great to see how smoothly electronic meetings have run thus far,"" said LaPointe. Until mid-March, electronic participation in open council meetings across the province was allowed but members who took part did not count toward quorum — the minimum number of elected representatives required to conduct business. The province changed the rules to allow for electronic quorum during the global pandemic and let councils carry on with city business. Running the electronic meetings — whether in Port Colborne, Pelham, Wainfleet or Welland — comes with challenges, including how to hold in camera sessions and how to deal with those councillors who may have a conflict of interest with an agenda item. Though not a legislative requirement under the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act for an elected official to leave council chambers when they declare a conflict, in practice most municipal councillors often leave the room or stand at the back. But with electronic meetings and livestreams running at the same time, municipalities are coming up with ways to deal with the situation. LaPointe said Port Colborne can remove a councillor from the meeting and place them in a virtual waiting room where they can still see and hear the meeting, but cannot speak or be seen. She said last Monday's meeting had several council conflicts for which councillors were placed in the virtual room. Video of the meeting can be found on the city's YouTube page. Welland city clerk Tara Stephens said if members declare a conflict they are asked to turn off their cameras. ""They can listen to the discussion as it is public information,"" said Stephens. Town of Pelham clerk Nancy Bozzato said councillors there are asked to turn off their video and mute their audio but remain in the electronic meeting so that they will know when to re-enter. ""We are also required to maintain and publish a registry of declarations,"" she said. Wainfleet chief administrative officer and clerk William Kolasa said a township councillor turning off a mic and camera essentially removes them participating while remaining in the electronic meeting room. Stephens said when the discussion is finished councillors can turn their cameras back on, though they may not be seen as only four screens show at a time on the live feed coming out of city hall. LaPointe said the city uses a conference version of the Zoom software and once the discussion is over councillors are brought back from the virtual waiting room. The clerks said as long as councillors don't try and influence a vote for which they have a conflict, they are free to continue to watch the livestream. They all said councillors are bound by the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act and each municipality's Code of Conduct. ""If an elector believes that a member of council is not following them (the act or code) they can request an investigation with the municipal integrity commissioner,"" said LaPointe. In-camera sessions, which are never held in a live setting with members of the public or media present, are not broadcast over livestreams. Bozzato said if there was an in camera session being held and a councillor had a conflict they would be asked to completely remove themselves from the electronic meeting. That same rule applies in Port Colborne. When companies across the world started using Zoom to hold remote meetings with staff, hackers were able to hijack meetings. Stephens said Welland uses Microsoft Teams for its meetings and it has the high privacy standards that meet the city's needs. ""It allows me to only invite those who are required to attend the meeting,"" she said. Pelham relied heavily on its information technology specialists to test all components including security, said Bozzato. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""Councillors were also provided with tips about closed meeting attendance from home such as ensuring they are alone in the room and that the meeting cannot be seen/heard by others in the household, similar to protecting confidential hard copies of documents,"" she said. Kolasa said when Wainfleet established its electronic closed meeting process it attempted to ascertain best practices from across the continent and incorporate those into its procedures. ""We have not yet held a closed meeting virtually. We are working to hold our first meeting in June and putting in place the proper security and procedures,"" said LaPointe. In general, Stephens said the electronic meetings are going well. ""Our last meeting there were some connection issues for some members of council. We are being patient with the system, and taking our time to ensure all councillors are present, and if they need to disconnect and reconnect to the meeting, we allow that before proceeding forward with matters,"" Stephens said. Bozzato said with strong support from Pelham's IT and clerk's teams, as well as early testing and practice before its first electronic meeting, the town has been successful in continuing to conduct the corporate business through virtual meetings. ""This also includes delegations that are of a time-sensitive nature. The uptake by councillors speaks to their commitment to safely carry on with the municipal responsibilities,"" she said. Kolasa said the township has experienced some bandwidth issues from time to time but is taking time to ensure all councillors are able to participate. LaPointe said the electronic meetings were a challenge to implement as it was something new to all municipalities in Ontario. ""A great deal of consideration went into the process to ensure security, transparency, and the delegation process. We created detailed procedures, implemented contingency plans, and held training for council and staff to ensure a smoothly run meeting."" ""WeeStreem has aided us in this undertaking and has helped us provide effective and professional electronic meetings,"" she said of the company that runs the live streams. - Niagara politicians finding new ways to stay engaged with residents - Electronic meeting a first for Welland council - St. Catharines city council to meet electronically - Sendzik holding live chats during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mayor Frank Campion said he believes he has that power under the Municipal Emergency Act. ""But I wouldn't use it,"" he told city councillors at last week's meeting. Campion said there's no reason for a councillor to be physically present at meetings right now. Since declaring a state of emergency in the city and shutting down city hall, councillors have transitioned to meeting electronically. There were a few meetings, a couple of which were special meetings, to which less than half of council - there are 12 councillors and the mayor - showed up in chambers at city hall. Last Tuesday, Ward 5 Coun. Graham Speck said past technical problems have been sorted out, making the electronic meetings run smoother. But he still had questions about physical attendance. ""Can staff prevent a councillor from attending a meeting in person if they so chose? What if a councillor wants to be stubborn?"" he asked. Chief administrative officer Gary Long said council has been consistently told in the past few weeks to follow public health's message to go home, stay home and work from home. ""We have staff in place to deal with the technology so we can have a meeting. Tonight's meeting is a great success . this is working from my perspective,"" Long said of the electronic meeting. ""I don't see why a councillor would need to be in council chambers."" Speck said he considered the meeting a success as well. Before he asked about physically attending the meetings, Speck questioned why Tuesday's meeting started at 5 p.m. instead of the usual 7 p.m. He said council had previously debated earlier start times and turned the idea down. ""Is there a reason? Will we try to get back to some normalcy, albeit electronically?"" Speck asked. Campion said the earlier start time was to ensure the technology being used was working properly. Ward 4 Coun. Tony DiMarco wanted to know what would happen if a councillor lost the electronic connection to the meeting in the middle of a debate or just before a vote. Loading...

It is probably reassuring that our mortality rates and hospitalization rates are in actuality lower than what we have detected so far.” Hirji said study results give public health officials a “rough antibody estimate.” Officials obtained the data from 8,902 blood samples sent to Public Health Ontario’s Toronto lab between March and June to test other diseases. The specimens were then re-analyzed to detect antibodies for the virus that causes COVID-19. Niagara Public Health is reporting six new cases of COVID-19 Sunday after four new cases were reported on Saturday. There are a total of 45 active cases. The figures bring the total number of cases in Niagara to 896, of which 786 have been resolved, which means the individuals are no longer isolating or in hospital. Hirji reiterated that numbers from the study reflect that there is no immunity to the virus in the vast majority of the public at large. “All of those things we need to do to protect ourselves from COVID are still very important,” Hirji said of social distance, wearing face coverings when you can’t social distance, and being vigilant about and washing or hand sanitizing. “That risk is still out there.” Hirji said the findings are in line with something many doctors have suspected. https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/2020/07/covid-19-epi-seroprevalence-in-ontario.pdf?la=en “When you see cases of community transmission where we don’t know where the source of the infection is from, they have likely been in touch with someone who doesn’t even know he or she has COVID-19 and is out in the community spreading the virus. “The belief is there have been more COVID-19 out there then we have been able to identify through our usual testing methods.” Hirji said the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is on record saying it thinks the actual number of COVID-19 cases is 10 times higher than what they have seen. Hirji said there are several things the public should keep in mind about the provincial study. Hirji said the immune system is about more than antibodies. When dealing with a virus, other immunity cells are more important, including T Cells.

Likewise, the absence of antibodies doesn’t mean an individual isn’t immune. The immunity isn’t just in the form of antibodies. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Robert Hicks doesn’t mind handing over control of his new play to others. In fact, that’s exactly his plan. Like many people across Niagara, the 72-year-old self-described peace activist and climate change activist from Niagara Falls found himself with plenty of time on his hands when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Ontario in March: his gym closed, so he couldn’t work out, and his regular volunteer sessions at Greater Niagara General Hospital were put on hold. Then he caught wind of a new project at Brock University calling on Niagara residents to share stories, experiences, projects and thoughts on the pandemic so information can be preserved for future generations to learn what it was like in this region during these unprecedented times. Brock University’s archives and special collections and digital scholarship lab have created a website to capture the experience of living in Niagara region during the COVID-19 pandemic. People can upload digital materials such as photos, videos, texts or tweets to the website, can complete a brief survey on the website, or can donate physical records such as a diary or journal to Brock’s archives. David Sharron, head of archives and special collections at the university’s James. A. Gibson Library, said too often in history we only hear from politicians, business leaders and influencers. The Brock COVID-19 archive is a unique opportunity for regular citizens to be part of the history of the pandemic by creating a grassroots source for future generations, he said. “For some people, this might be the only opportunity to share the experience to be found in an archive 50 or 100 years from now,” said Sharron. “This is the true gem of history.” Having people share their thoughts and experiences now rather than months from now when they have time to polish them allows it to be “genuine and truly historic,” he said. “It’s more unfiltered this way.” One Niagara resident, identifying herself as a widow, lamented the psychological toll COVID-19 is taking while answering the survey on the website. “I’m just so freaking tired of being alone and lonely,” she said. Welland Grade 10 student Thea Armenti, 16, submitted an original song she wrote and performed called “Six Feet” in which she explores the destruction wrought by the virus. “We sit at home helpless while so many die,” her lyrics read. “Now, all we can do is hang our heads and cry.” Other residents submitted photos of shuttered schools, businesses and playgrounds in Port Dalhousie, people lining up for curbside pickup of items at Best Buy, and signs of hope in windows or written on sidewalks in chalk. A woman from Port Colborne who buried her 96-year-old dad, a Second World War veteran, on March 14, said she hadn’t been able to hug her kids or grandkids for weeks since then. “Grieving as a family can’t happen for us right now,” she wrote in her submission. “I want this to be over so badly. I want to cry.” Hicks decided to write an educational play entitled “Virus under the microscope,” in which he includes COVID-19 with other scourges he calls viruses including racism, prejudice, discrimination, bullying, bigotry, social indifference and police brutality. The play revolves around two unnamed lab technicians who spend their days poring over viruses at microscopes, and how their messages of goodwill, compassion, respect and justice can send the viruses surrounding them (they can’t see them) fleeing in terror. “I built in a reason for hope so people can feel better,” said Hicks. “I just want to spread the word that we can make the world better if we work together.” Hicks submitted his first two acts to the website and just completed a third act. He figures he may finish acts four and five, but is hoping other people will take over from there and add their own acts.

I have been impressed by New York State’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo who “schooled” the audience day after day, often breaking the numbers down county by county. I think this paper could print a daily chart to show the progress town by town for the Niagara region. It could be used as “town square” to congratulate or condemn successes and activities. Although it seems like a long grind since early March I believe we are only approaching the end of the beginning. Stage 3 will be a roller-coaster ride if we don’t pay attention with the influx of visitors to the area not seen prior to now. Paul Fitzgerald Fort Erie Home care key to improving care for all seniors Re: Heavy lifting for long-term care awaits Doug Ford, July 17 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on what we have known for a long time — that we need to fundamentally improve how we care for our seniors. Doing so must involve giving them the care they want, where they want it – at home. That is why I read the Niagara Dailies’ recent editorial with such interest, as it is critical this conversation involve expanding the use of home care. We know seniors want to stay in their homes as they age — and the pandemic has shown that staying safe and healthy has never been more important for seniors. Each and every day over 35,000 highly trained home-care professionals deliver care in people’s homes, which continued right through the pandemic, to help them do that. Home care can do more, people want it to do more, and Ontario’s health-care system needs it to do more. We encourage people to visit www.choosehomecare.ca to find a provider in their area or talk to their doctor about the next steps in having trained home care health professionals help them age at home. We know it is where people want to be and must seize this moment to ensure home care is a key part of how we improve care for all seniors in the province. Sue VanderBentCEO, Home Care Ontario COVID the new excuse for wasteful spending Re: Niagara Region forecasting $5-million deficit, but some help is on the way from federal and provincial governments, July 30 How long does the taxpayer have to suffer from inane remarks from our elected representatives? When is at least one leading politician, municipal, regional, provincial or federal going to be honest and accept they are the problem?

The municipality learned Monday another $4 billion in funding from the provincial and federal governments will be available to support Ontario municipalities and transit systems as they deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Monday’s announcement came on the heels of one in mid-July, when the federal government said it will provide the provinces with $19 billion in relief, $7 billion of which is headed to Ontario. That money is earmarked for child care, contact tracing, mental health, personal protective equipment and help for municipalities. On the local front, a report from Region staff estimates the municipality is facing a $5-million budget deficit for 2020. When the deficits of the local municipalities are included, the total is about $12.9 million. “We hope that with a good allocation of funding, we won’t have to have drastic cuts in services or substantial increases in property tax,” Region Chair Jim Bradley said. “As municipalities, we feel we’ve made a good case to the provincial and federal governments.” Niagara isn’t alone in making that case. The Region of Waterloo recently estimated its deficit will reach $17 million without help from higher levels of government. The City of Toronto’s pandemic cost are in the range of $1.5 billion. The Municipal Act prevents municipalities from running deficits, and Bradley doesn’t foresee the rule changing. “Our hope is for the federal or provincial government to provide assistance, and we are very encouraged with the recent announcements,” he said. A report from the Region said gross costs associated with the pandemic are $49 million. When the lower-tier municipalities are added, the figure jumps to $78 million regionwide. “Both levels of government in Niagara have been doing things to mitigate those costs,” Bradley said. “There is a hiring freeze. We are reducing transit services, non-essential repair, and maintenance projects, and deferring some seasonal services. We have cancelled or delayed non-essential capital projects. “The local municipalities have closed libraries and arenas and things like that.” Bradley said the Region has mandated areas of responsibility, which reduce council’s ability to manoeuvre. “When you provide ambulance services, you can’t cancel them,” Bradley said. “We fund the Niagara Regional Police. We have public health. We operate eight long-term care homes. “Social services are under our umbrella. We operate water treatment and sewage treatment plants.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Regional Chair Jim Bradley delivers state of the region address Jun. 18, 2020 Council Niagara restaurants, bars now required to keep customer log Jul. 28, 2020 Niagara Region Niagara regional council passes mandatory mask bylaw Jul. 24, 2020 The Region does have reserves on hand for emergencies, including a Taxpayer Relief Fund. As of the end of last year its balance was $23.8 million, or 4.2 per cent of gross budgeted expenditures. That percentage is important because the Region has a minimum reserve target of 10 per cent of gross budgeted operating expenses. Using that figure, the fund should be at $56 million. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Councillors could decide to use the fund to cover the deficit for 2020, but that would leave a balance of $18.8 million, or 3.4 per cent of the gross budget, the report said. The report said the depletion of the reserve to “extremely low levels” would eliminate using the fund to offset budget pressure in 2021 and beyond.

People must be accountable for their actions. If they don’t wear a mask, they should be fined or asked to leave. If there are no consequences for not wearing a mask, people won’t bother wearing one. If there is no enforcement, word will spread: Let’s go to Niagara, they don’t care if we wear a mask. First your council didn’t want to vote the bylaw in, it didn’t want to be the bad guy, and now you don’t want to enforce it. It is not the time to be nice. The very people who work in the tourism industry you so heartily support are at risk, along with their families and friends. Anyone can go down to the tourist district on any day and see a lot of people not physical distancing and not wearing masks. Or go to the lobby of any of the hotels and see people constantly being asked to don a mask. Terry MoroccoWelland Fort Erie beach accessed by short-term rental guests Re: Fort Erie mayor says Region funding doesn’t entitle others to visit Bay Beach, July 31 I read this article and others on the topic with great interest. It strikes me as disingenuous to say that Bay/Crystal Beach is only open to residents when in fact anyone who rents one of the 126 registered short-term rentals in Fort Erie (or other rental accommodation) is eligible to use the beach if the owner of the property they are renting has obtained beach passes. In fact, most of the short-term rentals have done just that and since the majority of “guests” are from the GTA there are potentially thousands of people from outside the Niagara area using Bay/Crystal beach on a regular basis. Greg GrantRidgeway Trump’s words about COVID deaths revealing On the holiday Monday, I heard U.S. President Donald Trump interviewed on TV in which he expressed his thoughts about the 150,000-plus American deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His casual response was “it is what it is.” Such a response is so non-committal, so dismissive, so cold and so unbelievable. Really, without researching too deeply I can only compare it to Marie Antionette’s infamous gaffe about starving French: “Let them eat cake.” Once again Trumpspeak has tarnished his image as a caring American president, revealing the self-centred egoist he really is. John EverrettWelland Virus may spell the end of professional sports I have some thoughts about the return of organized sports, including hockey, baseball, basketball and football.

Carolynn Ioannoni, I felt compelled to voice my opinion. Both make good points regarding implementation of mask wearing, but I feel Coun. Ioannoni wins the battle. This is a worldwide pandemic and, unless you’ve been unconscious for the past six months, we all know the importance of mask wearing, hand washing and physical distancing. Money would be well spent hiring bylaw enforcement officers instead of seeking “crush the curve” ambassadors. This is a serious, death threatening virus and from what I’ve observed in Niagara Falls, there are still too many people not following the guidelines. We are a few weeks away from schools opening. Does the mayor not find it more important to keep the residents of Niagara Falls as safe as possible so children can return to school, or is tourism the No. 1 priority? We could have the best of both worlds if visitors and residents understood there are consequences to not following the rules. Do they still teach this in school? Linda Holmes Niagara Falls There’s no reasonable rationale for opening the border Re: July 31: Border closure ‘paranoia’ not warranted and other letters to the editor I read with dismay letters that advocate opening our border with the U.S. Clearly little thought or research has gone into claims that the situation with COVID-19 is not really so bad. It is bad in the U.S., the worst in the world, and all it takes is one or two so-called “super-spreaders” to come into Canada and a whole new massive wave of infections would cause thousands more deaths here. I do advocate Canada Border Services Agency having the discretion to allow entry in certain special cases, of course, humanitarian and perhaps medical as well as family reunions. However, we have the example of Americans falsely stating their purpose to drive to Alaska as they enter B.C. One can imagine the wish to get out of the U.S. hell-hole of pandemic growing stronger, not weaker. In addition, COVID-19 has not really been stamped out in the U.S. There is no rationale whatsoever for opening borders to entry from a country where simple mask wearing is questioned and millions still believe the pandemic is a hoax.

My daughters, both over 55, teach high school. One of them is my caregiver. It would be impossible for her to isolate from me, and I am unlikely to survive infection. The connections between school and community are wide and deep, and just two or three asymptomatic infections of children can spread quickly and fatally. The government is treating high school as an afterthought. Suppose a student in another classroom gets COVID-19. The student, all family members, classmates and teachers have to isolate. What happens to other students of those teachers? Where is the money for supply teachers? This “plan” is about the economy, about enabling parents of young children to work, not about anyone’s health and safety. In Saturday’s editorial, you advocated using alternate spaces to distance elementary students. That would cost money which the Ford government is unwilling to spend, preferring to send students back into already over-crowded, disease-prone classrooms. Alternate spaces and more teachers would solve a number of problems, including permitting full-time instruction for secondary students. Removing 50 per cent of instructional time is very damaging at this point in their education. There is no day set aside for deep cleaning of classrooms. Teachers are getting “medical grade masks” according to the plan. Most teachers work in buildings without air conditioning. Are students and teachers expected to wear masks for five hours a day in hot September conditions? The government’s plan is also unclear regarding teachers who feel unsafe. They can teach online but there is no clarity as to what they would be teaching. Their own classes? Students who opted out of in-class learning? If teachers opt to teach online, where do they get the resources to print assignment submissions? The government needs to address these structural issues, not download everything on school boards with limited resources. As long as younger Canadians continue to flout safety directives and drive cases higher, schooling remains in jeopardy.

One can tell when the traffic signal is green by the way the traffic flies up and down the road. The noise is caused mostly by motorcycles revving and backfiring along with small trucks. The noise of backfiring is so loud at times it sounds like gunfire. Also the volume of traffic is so bad at times it is almost impossible to exit our parking lot onto the road.

The recreational canal stretches from Welland International Flatwater Centre, at Townline Tunnel Road, north past the Community Boathouse on Thorold Road to the working Welland Canal. There’s an increased usage of the trail system that runs parallel to the recreational waterway, as people travel and explore locally due to the COVID-19 pandemic that’s restricted cross border and international travel. Dalton said the city doesn’t have a way to track the number of users along either the waterway or trail system but there is a definite upward trend. “People are looking for things to do and are finding their way to the water,” he said, adding warm weather is also a factor. The Lincoln Street Docks area is seeing fewer people trying to escape the heat in the waters of the former canal. A gate leading to the docks was closed earlier this year as the city worked to ensure pandemic guidelines were met. Construction is now underway for a new community boathouse with work expected to be completed by the end of the month. Those seeking relief from the heat either in the water or in the shade moved to the flatwater centre, which has seen rowing, swimming and triathlon events cancelled due to the global pandemic. Kayakers, canoers, standup paddleboarders, and swimmers can be found daily on the water. Inflatable craft can be found drifting close to shore or down the waterway most days, and people are picnicking beneath some of the trees that line the waterway. “People are exploring the waterway and we hope they are doing do in a safe manner,” said Dalton. There are no lifeguards stationed along the waterway. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Dave Johnson is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

Floatfest was to be held this Sunday but was cancelled in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and provincial emergency orders pertaining to gatherings of people. “Floatfest is one of Welland’s signature summer events, and everyone looks forward to it,” said Welland Fire and Emergency Services Deputy Chief Adam Eckhart in a release from the city. “Without Floatfest event co-ordinators in place to ensure safety, it’s a hazard for people to continue the event without any safety protocols in place. “Floatfest is cancelled this year, and we’re asking residents to respect this decision.” The event has attracted up to 1,800 people at the Lincoln Street Docks area in past years. Participants bring all manner of inflatable devices and drift between Lincoln Street Bridge to the north and former Bridge 15, a swing bridge that carries trains over the waterway, to the south. There are lifeguards on duty during the event and personal watercraft ready to help people in need. The city said the unsupervised waterway is a risk to be taken seriously and that gatherings on it are potentially dangerous and could lead to serious injury. The release said it would be hard to maintain physical distancing of two or more metres on the water while on flotation devices. To ensure physical distancing guidelines, bylaw staff will monitor the waterway the weekend of July 4 and 5, the release said. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Tuesday, council awarded a request for proposal (RFP) to PT Watersports, the only company to put in a bid with the city to operate the park. It will be located just south of the community boathouse on Thorold Road. The idea of a waterpark has been floated since August 2019 and earlier this year two different groups - Pirate Ship Cove out of Jordan and Welland resident Derek Stonier of Splashtown Niagara - approached the city about setting up in the former canal. In early February, after Stonier's presentation, Welland councillors directed staff to prepare an RFP for a waterpark instead of accepting either group's proposals. Ward 4 Coun. Bryan Green questioned the decision to have the park open in 2021. Richard Dalton, the city's manager of recreation and culture, said the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when city facilities would reopen contributed to the July 2021 opening. PT Watersports also has to order inflatables and have them built, a six- to seven-month process. The company opened its first waterpark - FunSplash Hamilton - in June 2018 at Binbrook Conservation Area. It also operates St. Marys Quarry waterpark in St. Marys. Green asked about parking in the area with just one lot on the north side of the boathouse. He, and Ward 4 Coun. Tony DiMarco, said residents in the area were concerned people would be parking along the laneway leading to the waterpark or on Thorold Road. Dalton said there was decent parking at the boathouse and an area just north that could be utilized. ""We are in the early stages right now and we don't know how many cars would be there,"" said Dalton, adding it is something the city will keep an eye on. A proponent of a waterpark, Ward 3 Coun. John Chiocchio wanted to reopen the RFP process and to give the other two groups another shot. ""We had two groups here that came to council and were so excited,"" said Chiocchio, adding council was prepared to move forward with one of them at one point. He asked what would have happened if no one responded to the city's RFP. Dalton said city staff would have sought direction from council. ""The RFP we received was extremely strong . it was an impressive response,"" he said. Steve Zorbas, Welland's chief financial officer, echoed Dalton's comment. ""I strongly advise council to pass this, the RFP is solid and everyone had a chance to bid. The only bidder put a lot of time and effort into this, they are experienced operators,"" said Zorbas. Chiocchio said he couldn't decide on the issue Tuesday. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Mayor Frank Campion said if council kept delaying a decision nothing would ever happen. ""This was a public process,"" he said, adding the RFP was open and transparent. Six companies took RFP documents, issued in March. Dalton said the two companies that first approached council were sent forms asking why they did not bid, and, to date, neither has responded. Ward 6 Coun. Bonnie Fokkens wanted the report referred back to staff her motion failed. Fokkens was concerned over a lack of information when it came to liability insurance, security, the size and capacity of the park, and the number of lifeguards that would be working. Travers Fitzpatrick, Welland's general manager of infrastructure and development, said the normal requirement for liability insurance is $5 million with the city a coinsured party. Fitzpatrick said the size and capacity of the park will be determined by the types of structures the company installs. Zorbas said there will be security and added there was proprietary information the company didn't want competitors to know when it came to the park. He said a short-term lease was being worked out with the company and it will include an option to renew. DiMarco, who also wanted to see the report sent back to staff, said there's a misconception that the waterpark will be free to residents. The report said admission to the park will be set at $22 for a two-hour pass and $30 for a daily pass. The actual cost could vary as the city negotiates with the private company. ""It seems we are rushing this,"" said DiMarco, adding the waterpark should be set up in the Lincoln Street Docks area, where the city's boat rental program is moving.

He drank them back before stripping down to a pair of shorts and sandals and heading into the near-freezing waters off Thorold Road in Welland. Ossa said he's not crazy - although his mother and stepfather disagree with him on that. The 22-year-old Welland man slowly worked his way to waist-deep water before taking numerous deep breaths and submerging himself neck-deep. A friend onshore started a stopwatch on his cellphone, making sure Ossa stayed in the water no longer than two minutes. Another friend used a small drone to capture the action. Before Ossa set foot in the water - he measured the temperature with an infrared thermometer - he spoke about why he was taking the chilly dip. ""I started getting into this because in the past I had some health and fatigue issues."" The ""this"" Ossa was referring to is cold therapy or cold thermogenesis - a way of using cold water immersion to take care of various health issues. ""I was always into working out and fitness . I stumbled on this method. I like to explore new ideas,"" said Ossa. He found research done by a neurosurgeon, who set out protocol for cold water immersion. ""I decided to give it a shot to see how it works for me,"" said Ossa. He started in July by dunking his face in a sink full of cold water. Then he dunked his face in 10 C water every other night for a month. ""And then I felt like I was ready to do an actual ice bath."" Ossa bought a horse trough and filled it with cold water and large ice chunks. ""It was really hard for me at first, but the more I did it the easier it became over time."" Before his dip in the canal, 6 C was the lowest temperature Ossa reached. He could sit at that temperature for at least 15 minutes. With the repeated dunking, Ossa noticed he had more energy, felt healthier and started to lose fat with little to no exercise. He said it has also helped him sleep better. On this day, he said he planned to be in the recreational canal for two to three minutes at most. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""I care about my safety, I'm not planning to swim. The biggest risk at this temperature is cold shock . I wouldn't just jump in,"" he said, adding a disclaimer that people shouldn't just go out and try cold thermogenesis. ""You do have to be careful."" Although advising people they should consult their family doctor first before trying, Ossa said he hadn't spoken with his before carrying out his research. He added, ""It's good for my well-being and is very therapeutic."" After getting out of the water - he was in for just more than two minutes - Ossa said everything in his body was telling him to get out. ""Your survival instincts kick in . my arms and legs were a bit numb. My hands were stinging a bit,"" he said, adding it was nevertheless a big rush. Stephen Cheung, a professor in Brock University's kinesiology department, said cold therapy or cold thermogenesis, in his opinion, is more of a psychological benefit than anything else. ""I don't believe it has any major long-term health benefits,"" he said. Cheung said when a person goes into cold water their skin temperature drops rapidly, eliciting a cold shock response. ""Your body responds with a very strong flight or fight response. You will hyperventilate and breathe more rapidly."" A person's resting heart rate can climb anywhere up to 140 to 150 beats per minute - which could be dangerous for those with heart issues. He said if a person is in cold water for just a few minutes there won't be a significant drop in body temperature. The longer they are in the water, however, their core temperature could drop, and hypothermia can set in. Being in the cold water for a few minutes can be a ""real wake-up and leave you in a highly-stressed state for a few minutes,"" said Cheung.

Speaking to people from Toronto and its surrounding area during a media conference in Beamsville Tuesday, Ford said: “By all means, I understand why you’d come to a beautiful region, down to Niagara. It’s absolutely gorgeous here and you end up over at Niagara Falls, again a beautiful area.” “But folks, you have got to practise the golden rule — social distancing, make sure you have a face covering when you go in lines, down on the strip there in Niagara Falls,” he added. He said he was shown images of crowds in Niagara Falls during a morning briefing. “It’s just about consideration, respecting other people. That’s really what it comes down to,” he said. Ford said local political leaders are doing an “incredible job” in encouraging efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus. And the issue isn’t a lack of advertising to warn people about the risks of ignoring public health advice. “We’ve spent more money on advertising, the feds have, municipalities have. Everyone knows the rules, just respect them. It’s as simple as that,” he said. Ford said Ontario has “come so far as a province and everyone has pitched in right across the board” to reduce the number of cases of the virus. As a result of those efforts, he said, the province is “leading North America in the lowest cases.” In Niagara, only two new cases were reported Tuesday but last week saw 38 new cases, including three days with five new cases each and one day with a 21-case spike. Many of the new cases have been in Niagara Falls, which has become the epicentre of the outbreak in Niagara. Niagara-on-the-Lake Lord Mayor Betty Disero said it was a busy holiday weekend in her town, despite rain on Sunday. She said there were a few restaurant patios “where people were a little bit too close for comfort,” but after weeks of running an educational campaign “everybody knows now” to stay distanced. “We’re finding more and more people are wearing masks when they come and just walk around downtown,” Disero said. She said the number of tourists in town is “still way below” the number of visitors prior to COVID-19. “We don’t have the numbers we used to have but that’s OK,” she said. “Considering that over 30 per cent of Ontario’s population is a little bit afraid to come out, we’re doing fine.” Disero said it will take Shaw Theatre’s reopening to really bring back the tourists. Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati said despite crowds, “there are a lot more people wearing masks — significantly more than there has ever been” in his city. “The message is getting out,” he added. He said nearly all passengers that were arriving in Niagara Falls aboard the GO train were wearing masks, and “just one train had 400 people” aboard. Diodati said COVID-19 statistics have been “in a very good place, here in Niagara.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Niagara’s low COVID-19 numbers may be giving false sense of security Aug. 04, 2020 Niagara Region Niagara Falls becoming local COVID-19 epicentre Jul. 28, 2020 Niagara Region Influx of beachgoers in Port Colborne ‘overwhelming,’ says fire chief Aug. 04, 2020 “I think it’s going in the right direction.” Although he said some people have suggested shutting down tourism, that’s not possible. “There are 40,000 people who depend on tourism to put food on their table.

Students in all elementary grades will return full time, as will secondary students in some smaller boards. Teens in large urban boards will be in school half-time and learning online from home the rest of the time, Premier Doug Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced Thursday. And starting in Grade 4, students will wear face masks all day, with the younger children also encouraged to do so. “Five days a week, five hours of instruction a day with lunch and breaks in between … on Sept. 8, you can drop your child off at school knowing that every possible measure is being taken to keep our children safe, knowing that there is a detailed plan to keep our kids safe,” said Ford. The government is not implementing any physical distancing requirements, and said classes in elementary schools will remain the same size as previously, with 20 students from grades 1 to 3, and an average of 24 or 25 students in grades 4 to 8 — though averages mean some classes are much larger than that. High school students, however, will be in cohorts of 15 when they are in school on alternate-day or otherwise modified schedules. District School Board of Niagara chair Sue Barnett is generally supportive of the government’s direction. “The government has based their decision on the best medical help they could find,” she said. A decision to hire 500 nurses for schools across Ontario is a good step, she said. “I am not sure what the format will look like, but it is needed. I think they have done the best they can do,” Barnett said. “There is not enough funding to ensure safety,” she said. “But we are going to fight for some more. All we can do is give our input. During our teleconference on Tuesday, I will articulate what else we will need.” The province will spend $309 million for the fall reopening, including $60 million for personal protective equipment; $80 million for additional staffing (teachers, caretakers) and $25 million for cleaning supplies. Niagara’s three NDP MPPs were united in their criticism, which mostly focused on concern the government has not provided enough money for a safe return to schools. “This plan puts our youngest and most vulnerable students at risk,” said Niagara Falls MPP Wayne Gates. “It’s not enough to keep our schools safe ... Our schools are overcrowded. There are infrastructure issues and I’m concerned on how they are going to implement the physical distancing.” Gates also raised concerns about a lack of consultation that occurred between the government and stakeholders. “They didn’t speak with any of the unions,” said Gates. “There was no dialogue. The way you develop a plan safely is by including all the stakeholders. They should have consulted parents, public health and all education unions.” St. Catharines MPP Jennie Stevens expressed similar concerns. “Successful social distancing needs more than guidelines, we need real investments to keep classes smaller and keep kids from losing another academic year,” Stevens said, describing the funding portion as a “drop in the bucket.” Said Niagara Centre MPP Jeff Burch, “Before the pandemic, schools were already short-staffed and underfunded. “This will not ensure that children are safe. The funding is completely inadequate. They should hire more teachers, custodians and (ensure) that the students are in a safe learning” What also concerns Burch is how “secondary school students will have to do 50 per cent of their courses online.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “This in no way prepares them for university or college and it is detrimental to their education.” Niagara West MPP and parliamentary assistant to Lecce, Sam Oosterhoff did not respond to an interview request. His office issued a statement that said the announcement is good news for students. “We are equipping school boards with unprecedented resources and flexibility,” the release said. “We are providing over $300 million in targeted, immediate and evidence-informed investments. Our plan for reopening safely is a deliverable plan, and one that ensures that students maximize their time in the classroom, being taught face to face by a teacher.” With files from the Toronto Star View document on Scribd Sean Vanderklis is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter for the Niagara Falls Review, covering education issues across Niagara.

It’s a pretty big deal,” said Nick Hilbing, the operatic society’s publicity and marketing director. Formed in 1945, the operatic society’s first show was in 1946 when “H.M.S. Pinafore” was performed at the former Inco (now Vale) hall. “Two nights ago, we had a meeting of the board of directors and made the difficult decision to cease operations until 2022.” Hilbing said the board was mulling the decision for months and waited until the last possible minute to make the call during a three-hour-long meeting. He said there was uncertainty over whether it could find a space to rehearse and whether it could put 600 people in seats at Lakeshore Catholic High School’s auditorium. “Our show would have had a large cast … it would be hard to have up to 50 people on stage with adequate distancing, wearing masks and trying to learn songs and rehearse.” Hilbing said the numbers are even higher when the lighting, sound and stage crews, and choreographer, director and musicians are taken into account. “It would be hard to protect all of our members.” He said the operatic society will be back in 2022 just as strong as it left the 2020 season when it performed “Mamma Mia.” “We were very fortunate we got through the run of our show this year and want to thank everyone for coming out and supporting us.” “Mamma Mia” ran Feb. 28 through March 8, just before the COVID-19 pandemic saw things shut down.

By The Welland Tribune Tue., Feb. 18, 2020timer3 min. read With her eyes focused on the stage, Heather King follows the movements of performers in Port Colborne Operatic Society's ""Mamma Mia!"" While the second-year choreographer is watching the cast — there are up to 62 performers on stage at one time throughout the show — she's moving along with them as she sits just behind the orchestra pit, her body swaying back and forth, and arms moving around. Keeping in time with the cast seems to come naturally to a woman who's been dancing since the age of five. ""It's well over 25 years now,"" said King, who started off taking tap dance lessons. Add ballet, jazz, modern dance and more to the list of styles she's learned over the years. For about the past decade the Niagara Falls woman has been teaching others how to dance, the last three at the Port Colborne studio she bought — Dance Expressions at 183 Main St. E. With 130 students coming to the studio, she said ballet is her favourite to teach. ""I have such a love for it … the history, the technique behind it. It's easy but hard to teach at the same time."" King came on board the operatic society last year for the show ""Once Upon a Mattress."" ""Iraina (Neufeld, operatic society director) reached out through other contacts looking for a choreographer."" Though she was happy to jump on board, King said she might have been a bit hesitant at first. ""Sunday is my only day off,"" she said with a laugh, noting her studio is open six days a week. ""But it doesn't bother me at all. I love what I do."" King was excited to take on the challenge of choreographing ""Mamma Mia!"" because of how much fun the ABBA-based show is. She researched what others did with the show — set on a Greek island, it follows a young bride-to-be's quest to discover the identity of her father in time for her wedding — and gathered some ideas from those. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""For the most part, I came up with it myself. I wanted to keep it fresh so that it's not the same show that someone has already seen."" After coming up with the choreography, King had to work with a cast with varying degrees of dance experience and ability, including those who had never danced before. ""It's just been really fun, and everyone is open-minded and willing to work hard, which is really great. ""Dancing is just like walking. You take one foot, pick it up and put it down in front of the other. You just learn to do that with music."" King said a former student of hers is in the cast, so she's been able to lend a hand when needed and take over when King's not there. ""It's nice to have her here."" The experience of working with the operatic society has been great, she said. ""The community and family feeling that is here is just incredible. Everyone welcomed me with open arms, I think I'm here to stay."" ""Mamma Mia!"" opens at the Lakeshore Catholic High School theatre, 150 Janet St., Saturday at 7:30 p.m. There are 2 p.m. performances Feb. 23 and 29 and March 1, 7 and 8. Other performances at 7:30 p.m. are Saturday, Feb. 29, which is a special singalong show, and Friday, March 6.

Those challenges include a large cast — 62 people — on stage at one time at least twice during the performance and ensuring the large ensemble is on time when singing backup for the main cast. The production also has several new faces behind the scenes and on stage. But those challenges Neufeld is happy to take on during her fourth production for the community-based group. During a recent rehearsal, she said ""Mamma Mia"" had been unavailable to community theatre groups until 2018. ""We applied and we are actually the first amateur community group in the Niagara region to perform it. ""We thought it would maybe bring a new audience in for us. It has very compelling music,"" she said. ""Mamma Mia"" follows a young bride-to-be's quest to discover the identity of her father in time for her wedding and is set on a Greek Island. Neufeld said as soon as it was announced the operatic society, founded in 1945, was putting on the show, more than a hundred people immediately applied to be part of it. ""It's because it's ABBA and fun to sing. It's just one of those shows … it's just fun to do. ""We have an amazing cast — a lot of regulars applied and a lot of new people who have never been part of the operatic society or even on stage before."" A long rehearsal period — the theatre group starts meeting in September once a week and switches to twice a week in November — Neufeld said, allows members to get to know each other and become like a family. ""It's not as stressful as trying to do a whole show in six weeks … it becomes very collegial. It does require a bit of a longer commitment, but it allows the cast to have a life and have fun on stage."" ""Mamma Mia"" opens at the Lakeshore Catholic High School theatre, 150 Janet St., Saturday, Feb. 22, at 7:30 p.m. There are 2 p.m. performances Feb. 23 and 29 and March 1, 7 and 8.

Before ""Mamma Mia"" finishes its run, Neufeld said, the operatic society will be considering next year's production.

In March, changes to the Municipal Act made by the province led to virtual attendance at council meetings counting toward quorum — the number of people needed to hold a meeting — and the city followed suit by changing its procedural bylaw. It allowed councils to continue to meet during the COVID-19 pandemic as physical distancing rules were put in place under provincial and municipal states of emergency. Last month the province said the meetings could continue after a declared state of emergency is over. Tuesday, during a special council meeting, city staff proposed changes to its procedural bylaw to match the Municipal Act. If council had taken no action, virtual attendance would have no longer counted toward quorum. Ward 1 Coun. Adam Moote questioned whether the process could be abused. Moote suggested someone could run for council as long as they had an address registered in the city leading up to an election. If elected, he said the person could then move out of the city and attend meetings virtually. “It’s too easy of an option to be abused in the future.” City clerk Tara Stephens said to run in an election a person needs to be a resident of the city and to maintain their seat they need to reside in Welland. Stephens said during monthly meetings with municipal clerks, concerns such as Moote’s have been raised. She said the virtual attendance would give councillors additional flexibility to take part in meetings if they could not be there in person. At Tuesday’s meeting, Ward 5 Coun. Claudette Richard took part from her family cottage outside of town. Stephens said the process would be reviewed regularly. Mayor Frank Campion said it is all about convenience, adding if elected officials felt strongly about an issue and were out of town they could still attend virtually. Ward 1 Coun. Mary Ann Grimaldi doesn’t believe there would be any misuse of the process. “If there was, this council would be all over it.” Grimaldi said many councillors would rather be in chambers. Ward 4 Coun. Bryan Green wanted a staff report on when councillors would be allowed back in city hall and what things might look like when it’s safe to be there.

But due to a technical glitch during the livestream, the information was not broadcast to people watching on the city's website, said city clerk Tara Stephens. ""Our technical support advised that a member clicked the share button of the Microsoft Teams toolbar. As soon as I saw it, I closed down the system."" Stephens could not confirm what information was shown as she did not get a clear look at it. ""I am not certain as to which councillor it was,"" she said. The livestream isn't on a delay but there is a 15- to 30-second delay between the meeting and the iSi Live recording. ""I would not have been able to remove the recording before it was broadcast on our website."" City council switched to electronic meetings two months ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has been using Microsoft Teams. Mayor Frank Campion, Stephens, chief administrative officer Gary Long and chief financial officer Steve Zorbas are usually the only ones in council chambers, though they were joined by Dan Degazio, general manager of economic development, recreation and culture, Tuesday night. Most members of council received training on how to use the system in April. Stephens said user profiles can be created for the councillors which would prevent them from pressing the share button and inadvertently showing personal information. - Electronic meeting a first for Welland council - Electronic council meetings come with challenges Loading...

From mid-July until last week, seven couples have wed at the rear of Welland Civic Square, as well as at other off-site celebrations in Niagara municipalities like Pelham and Niagara Falls, city clerk Tara Stephens said recently. Marriage licences have been signed in Welland for 34 couples and another 28 have appointments scheduled with her office to begin the process. The City of Welland has been offering these services since 2011. Stephens, as well as deputy clerk Margaret Corbett and a city staffer in the human resources department who is a registered officiant, perform the ceremonies. The number of weddings and certificates the city is overseeing during the pandemic, which has cancelled many big days across the region, is “about average” when compared to other years, said Stephens. The city doesn’t “generally know the history” about the bride and groom when it comes to their plans for an elaborate, lavish wedding attended by hundreds of people, but Stephens said she was aware of this being the case for at least one of the couples who were wed by the city in the past month. “Most are anticipating having a larger ceremony once COVID is somewhat over, or whatever the new normal looks like,” Stephens said. Couples don’t have to be from the Rose City to apply. “We encourage them to be Niagara region residents,” said Stephens, adding a screening processes related to COVID-19 and the couples’ eligibility for marriage are required. That’s one reason the city doesn’t issue licences and perform ceremonies in the same visit. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Love is back in the air!

Since mid-March, city facilities have been closed to the public. But starting Wednesday, the local government will open civic square to couples seeking marriage licenses. Appointments are required and can be booked between 9 a.m. and noon on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, according to a news release from the municipality. “The City of Welland is implementing safety protocols in public facilities, which include physical distancing, workplace sanitization, and pre-screening of applicants before appointments to increase appointment efficiency,” it said. Civic square will remain closed to the public except for the issuance of marriage licences or other pre-arranged appointments. Niagara residents who wish to obtain a marriage licence are required to book an appointment with the clerk’s department at 905-735-1700, ext. 0, or by emailing marriage@welland.ca. City clerk Tara Stephens said there have been “some inquiries” from the public regarding marriage licenses during the pandemic. The spring and summer months “tend to be busier,” she said, noting an average of 20 to 40 licenses are signed during this time of year. In what she called the off-season, she said about 10 to 20 licenses are usually provided.

With COVID-19 emergency order restrictions in place, gatherings of more than five people are not permitted. Cathy Davis is leading director at Cathy Davis and Co., a team of 13 wedding officiants that co-ordinates couples' nuptials locally. She said her industry is suffering during the pandemic. In 2019, her group officiated at more than 400 marriages. For 2020, there were 280 booked before everything shut down. In recent weeks, 115 weddings have either been cancelled or postponed until it is legal to celebrate with a large crowd. Her company has three Presbyterian ministers, one from a United church, and the rest are non-denominational. Their services are mostly non-religious, therefore aren't usually held indoors at churches. ""A lot of the weddings we do are at wineries and golf courses,"" she said. Davis believes there is a greater chance outdoor weddings will be permitted before services under a roof are. Part of the work her team — it also covers part of the Greater Toronto Area — is now focusing on is keeping couples optimistic that their big day will arrive eventually. ""We're doing a lot of reassuring and calming down."" But things aren't at a total standstill. Davis had two Niagara weddings to officiate this week, in Welland and Port Colborne. The maximum number of people that can be at a service during the pandemic is also the minimum requirement for a valid marriage in Ontario. Two witnesses, a bride and groom, and a minister must be together. All five must be present for the exchanging of vows, a declaration that they are married and the signing of the marriage licence. Davis said online weddings, officiated by someone who is not physically present with the couple, are not allowed in the province.

Considering how the country’s been shaken by a global pandemic, the worst recession in decades and a federal government in turmoil, that’s no big surprise. But with the mail-in votes soon to be tallied and the winner to be announced Sunday, it’s time for Canadians to pay close attention. It doesn’t just matter to the Conservative Party of Canada who its next leader is. It matters to the entire country because that individual could become prime minister before the year’s out. Given these high stakes, Peter MacKay is far and away the best option for the Conservatives. His political roots as the last leader of the Progressive Conservatives before they merged with the Alliance point to a Red Tory heart that would be far more in sync with today’s Canadian reality than anyone else running for the job. As Canada moves through, and hopefully out of, the pandemic, it needs a government with the guts and wits to successfully tackle the massive economic, social and environmental challenges facing it. That’s sure to mean more expensive and expansive government. But that’s also what stressed-out Canadians are demanding. This is simply not the time for a Conservative leader with conservative ideas stuck in a time warp and obsessed with balanced budgets and tax cuts. Erin O’Toole, the Ontario MP considered the main contender for the Tory leadership after MacKay, strikes us as being too mired in such a past. Moreover, with his Trump-like slogan, “A Call to Take Back Canada,” O’Toole hints at a present most Canadians would shun. The other two candidates — Ontario MP Derek Sloan and Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis — have largely made their names as social conservatives. However well that might resonate with a Tory splinter group, it will have no traction with the public at large. In marked contrast, MacKay is articulating a plan for a Conservative makeover that would establish the party as a viable alternative to the Liberals. Whether or not you’d even consider voting Conservative, our democracy needs such competition. It wouldn’t be easy for MacKay to deliver on his promises to make Canada more of a global powerhouse in technology, boost its advanced manufacturing and more smoothly move its natural resources to market. But these are positive ideas from a business-savvy individual who is not just a former MP but, these days, a high-profile lawyer in Toronto. Beyond being well-suited to these times, MacKay’s the best fit for this specific moment. Parliament was prorogued this week and will not resume until late September when the Liberals deliver their next Speech from the Throne. Should that throne speech fail to win majority support in the House of Commons, Justin Trudeau’s minority government will fall and there will be another general election. MacKay could hit the ground running under that scenario. His previous service as Canada’s attorney general as well as minister of both defence and foreign affairs underlines his experience, depth and credibility in high office. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... To say this is not to turn a blind eye to what many Canadians will consider to be his shortcomings, such as his stubborn opposition to carbon taxes. Nor is it at this time an endorsement of anything beyond the leadership of his party. But whether it’s holding the Liberals to account in Parliament or opposing them in an election, MacKay is hands down the best option to become the next Conservative leader. Let’s hope his party thinks so, too.

Never mind motivation and justification — that is all debatable. Never mind that Trudeau’s predecessor didn’t hesitate to use prorogation as a political tool on two occasions, one of them to stop opposition parties from forming a coalition against the Harper government. Those actions are what led Trudeau to promise in 2015 that he would not use proroguing as a political tool. Fair enough. But now it’s clear — once again — that he’s not doing politics differently than Harper, and, in fact, is behaving in much the same way. But in practical terms, the end of this parliamentary session doesn’t add up to much. The total sitting time lost is one day. The criticism that committee work on the WE scandal will be buried is partisan rhetoric. When Parliament returns, the committee work can begin again. What is more important is that Trudeau is using the one-month break to hit reset, not only on his political fortunes but on his government’s blueprint and vision for Canada. He promises a bold new agenda when Parliament returns, and promises to unveil it in a throne speech. That’s appropriate because it will automatically be a confidence matter, and so will trigger an election unless that agenda is supported by the majority of Parliament. The Bloc Québécois has already signalled its desire to topple the government. The Conservatives are being coy, but there’s little doubt they will oppose any agenda Trudeau puts forward. That means if the government doesn’t get the support of the NDP, Canada will go to the polls. That, too, is appropriate. Assuming that this vision is big and bold and addresses long-standing issues of equity and social support, an election will give Canadians a chance to endorse it or reject it. What about the vision, the plan? What should it include? Anonymous sources tell Reuters news service Trudeau wants sweeping changes to Canada’s social safety net, and wants economic measures that will support Canada’s ambitious climate agenda. Both things make sense. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed long-standing gaps and inequities. While everyone suffered, women suffered more than most. Trudeau’s social safety net overhaul can address that in part by finally implementing a child-care strategy that gives more women the opportunity to take part in the workforce if they choose to. The employment insurance system is obsolete, even with tweaks to make it more accessible to more people. It must be replaced by supports that recognize modern economic realities for working people, including gig and contract work, a lack of benefits and precarious work as well as outright job loss. The pandemic also exposed failures in long-term care across the country. While health care is provincial jurisdiction, the Canada Health Act is federal and the government should revise it to reflect long-term care as part of our universal health-care system. None of this will be cheap and that is where Chrystia Freeland comes in. The new finance minister will need to use all her innovation and collaboration skills to come up with ways to fund needed programs while still growing the economy. New revenue sources will almost certainly be needed. Canadians want and need to see a path back to budget balance, even if not in the near future. Freeland’s accomplishments suggest she is up to the task, but this is a massive undertaking, and Canada cannot afford missteps. The timing is right for a new economic and social blueprint. Let’s see what the Trudeau government comes up with. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Discussing the plan at a news conference in Beamsville recently, Ford said: “It’s not ‘our’ plan — we went with some of the brightest minds in the world. They’ve come up with a plan. I respect their plan. They’re the experts. But for the parents who are nervous, I understand.” Fair enough. But not entirely true. The province did seek input from top pediatric health specialists, including from SickKids, McMaster Children’s Hospital, London Health Sciences, Kingston Health Sciences Centre and others. Medical leadership from those facilities worked together to develop the “Updated COVID-19: Guidance for School Reopening” document, which was submitted to the province. The following is taken directly from that report: “Smaller class sizes should be a priority strategy as it will aid in physical distancing and reduce potential spread from any index case. Several jurisdictions have reopened schools with maximum class sizes ranging from 10-15.” SickKids president and CEO Dr. Ronald Cohn went further, saying: “If you have a certain number of children in a class … and physical distancing will be compromised by the number of children in the class, then we cannot and will not support this.” Here’s where it gets interesting. The government adopted “a majority” of the recommendations made by the health experts. But not the advice about class sizes. Instead, it elected to maintain class sizes in kindergarten through Grade 8. Class size recommendations for secondary schools reopening were adopted, but not for elementary schools. Why not? If the expert advice was heeded for secondary schools, why not for elementary schools? The government’s defenders, and there are not many at this point, would probably argue distancing isn’t as urgent in elementary schools because younger kids aren’t as efficient at spreading COVID-19 as teens. Evidence suggests that is true, but it also suggests that once a child reaches age 10, he or she is as efficient at spreading the virus as older kids or adults. That means that kids in Grades 4 (or possibly 5) and up are as vulnerable, and risky, as high school kids. The difference is that high school students will attend classes in groups no larger than 15, while elementary kids in Grades 5-8 will remain in classrooms as big as 28 or 30. In crowded classrooms, often with poor ventilation. More than one expert has said this is like a Petrie dish for COVID-19. And yet, the government will not budge. It has made more money available to improve ventilation and to hire more cleaning staff. It has agreed that school boards can dip into their reserves to pay for needed safety measures. (By the way, that’s not really helping, it’s downloading. School boards need those reserves for capital spending. But if they use them to pay for safety measures, capital spending will have to be postponed.) Time is winding down, but it is not too late. The government has shown some flexibility in terms of staggered school starting dates. It should do more on that front. If school boards need more time, they should have it. They also need extra financial resources to allow creativity in terms of setting up classrooms in settings other than traditional schools. That could go a good distance to solving the physical distancing challenges. But the single biggest thing the government can do to help Ontarians trust this process is reduce class sizes, at least in Grades 4 through 8. If it doesn’t, it’s likely a considerable number of parents won’t feel that trust and won’t send their kids back to school. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Formal complaints made by the end of the year are expected to be twice the number for 2019, said Steve Leavitt, national representative for the union. Leavitt later said the most recent grievance filed by one of his union’s members was the 20th this year among all three unions that represent municipal employees in Welland. About 15 of them are COVID-19 related. Unifor Local 199 president Greg Brady said no grievances have been made by any of the outside workers he supports. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1633 president Chris Moore did not have exact figures late Monday, but said some greivances have been filed by Welland transit drivers and that he has “expressed labour management concerns” with the city. Leavitt said more than half of this year’s complaints are connected to “managers doing the work of the bargaining unit,” referring to duties and responsibilities being shifted. There are two full-time unionized city staffers who have not been called back, one in recreation and culture and the other a parking enforcement officer, said Leavitt. A grievance filed in March comes from an employee who wanted to wear a mask but was told she couldn’t before being sent home by the city. She was away from work for six weeks, said Leavitt. “I’d say 2020 was a bad year,” in terms of the city-CUPE relationship said Leavitt. CUPE’s three-year contract expires at the end of this year. The city currently does not have a chief administrative officer. Leavitt hopes this has changed by the time contract bargaining resumes. “If it’s the present admin folks, I could see it being a very tough round of bargaining,” Leavitt said. Bargaining three years ago was “fairly normal” without any major concerns and issues, said Leavitt, adding the union had a “very good, respectful relationship with the employer” at that time. He said the city’s current leadership, which consists of a number of senior staff members, is taking a “hard line” with arguments against the grievances. “I don’t know that the people in charge are well-versed in labour relations,” he said. In April, the city handed out 101 temporary layoff notices to various casual and full- and part-time staff. There are about 150 CUPE Local 1115 members at Welland city hall, and 15 were laid off early in the pandemic. Unifor Local 199 represents outside workers including parks and recreation staff, water and sewer worker and facility workers, such as those at arenas. Twenty-three full-time and 19 casual Unifor workers were laid off by the city early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The city’s human resources manager, Andrea Daisley, said only six CUPE grievances have been made this year. She said she could not go on the record about the nature of those grievances.

He now says a total of 20 have been filed this year between all three bargaining units that represent various departments within the City of Welland.

This is according to human resources manager Andrea Daisley, who said Friday that a “potential return to work date has not been established at this time” for them. There are 18 part-time employees that remain out of work, said Daisley. Steve Leavitt, national staff representative for Canadian Union of Public Employees, represents unionized city workers in Welland. He told The Tribune there are five CUPE members who have been sitting at home watching their phones and email accounts since a city-wide shutdown of programming and facilities. Three employees from the recreation and culture division, as well as a traffic technician and parking-bylaw officer are currently not working. On July 6, the city’s recreation and culture department’s Facebook page posted that volunteers were being sought to assist with the farmers market, which will resume operations with a soft opening Saturday. Asked if this is unsettling, he said it depends on what type of tasks the volunteers are given. “It’s always a concern,” he said Friday. “I don’t know what they’ll be doing in particular. If they’re doing the work of the bargaining unit, that’s going to be an issue for us,” said Leavitt. One unionized full-time worker is on the job overseeing the operation of the farmers market, as well as a market co-ordinator. “If there are any issues with volunteers doing work we should be doing, she will let us know,” said Leavitt. Other municipal employers in Niagara have redeployed staff to other responsibilities that were not part of their daily routine before COVID-19. Welland could do the same, he said. “They’ve done whatever they can to keep people employed, even if it’s not the job they normally do,” said Leavitt, using Niagara Region bringing out-of-work employees back to handle COVID-19 screenings at long-term care homes as an example. Finding new tasks for people has already been discussed with the city, which he believes could be applied to CUPE Local 1115 members employed with the local government. “We’ve suggested that to the city, but with not much luck, unfortunately,” said Leavitt. Corporate Services general manager Steve Zorbas said Friday afternoon he did not have a breakdown of what departments the 15 laid-off staff are from. Out of the more than 100 people given notice in April, approximately 70 per cent of them are unionized, said Zorbas, adding that volunteers will not be taking on tasks they shouldn’t be and that the two individuals behind preparations and operation of Saturday’s market reopening will be able to cover the necessary work. “For this weekend, it’s all we require,” said Zorbas, unsure of how many city employees would be at the market on a typical weekend before COVID-19 arrived. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... He hopes staff who are on hiatus will eventually return, but when there is work to be done. “The staffing levels we have are sufficient to deliver the programs we currently offer,” said Zorbas. “If there’s no work, there’s no need to call back staff,” he added. The city “may increase staffing” as services and programming are restored, and provincial government restrictions are loosened. “We continue to review this on a weekly basis,” said Zorbas.

Zorbas said there are “no timelines established” for when the facility might reopen. He said the arena on King Street being put back in service will be discussed in the “coming weeks” by the municipality’s corporate leadership team. A total of 15-full time unionized employees were told early April that their services were not required when the COVID-19 pandemic took over. This was in addition to 12 full-time transit drivers, 17 full-time public works casuals, and 23 part-time staff, which included transit operators, transit terminal clerks, and recreation staff. Welland Public Library issued temporary layoff notices to 22 part-time workers, as well as eight full-time unionized library staff.

Twenty-three full time and 19 casual Unifor workers were laid off by the city due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Greg Brady, president of Unifor Local 199. The union represents outside workers including parks and recreation staff, water and sewer worker and facility workers, like those at the arenas. ""It would have been closer to 40. I commend the members for doing what they had to do to save as many jobs as possible. We all know it's not business as usual."" Brady said the layoffs are only for the length of the state of emergency declared by the province, to help flatten the spread of the virus. ""Then things would go back to normal work schedules as people returned."" Brady said without soccer or baseball fields or arenas to run and parks closed, it put a damper on the number of people needed to work. There are currently two outside crews working 12-hour shifts, six days week in the Rose City. The crews work every other day to ensure there is social distancing. Brady said members are complying with the social distancing rules and the seriousness of the situation. ""Nobody wants to see any workers infected with COVID-19."" In addition to the Unifor layoffs, the city laid off one firefighter, four non-union staff, 11 part-time workers, 21 full-time and eight part-time Amalgamated Transit Union members, and 14 full-time and eight part-time CUPE 1115 members. Steve Leavitt, CUPE national staff representative, said the union represents 150 workers inside Welland city hall and added no one is happy right now. ""The ones that were sent home know there is work for them to do and the ones left behind are not happy they have to do the work of those laid off,"" said Leavitt. He said some staff are working from home while others are working longer hours but fewer days. ""It varies depending on the department,"" said Leavitt, adding it seemed the city didn't want to negotiate. That led to some frustration. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""Other municipalities did not take the same kind of action as Welland. Niagara Falls brought 28 people back … that's a good news story from our point of view."" Leavitt said the union made suggestions to keep inside staff from being laid off including redeploying people into positions they don't normally do. He said there's an imbalance in the remaining workforce at city hall. ""There are four people working in the library, three are managers and there's one union person. In the engineering department, there are 10 people, five workers and five managers. The ratio of management to staff is a little unbalanced."" He said there were a few instances where the union questioned management doing the work of union members. ""People still want to work and there is work to do,"" Leavitt said, adding the union will be in contract negotiations later this year. - Remote work allowed for City of Welland employees - Welland closes most municipal facilities over COVID-19 fears - Temporary layoff notices handed to 101 City of Welland staff - National transit union calls for Welland to return to Sunday service levels SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

District School Board of Niagara and Niagara Catholic District School Board have both laid out their plans with similar COVID-19 protocols in place. A better handle were to be known on DSBN class sizes following a special board meeting Monday evening, but schools have already removed unnecessary furniture and will be setting up desks with as much distancing as possible, and to allow teachers as much teaching space as possible, the board said. Desks will be faced forward rather than in circles or groupings, both boards have outlined. They will be “placed as far apart as possible given the space in the room,” said Niagara Catholic. Cafeterias in both boards’ secondary schools will not be serving. Hand sanitizer will be readily available at all entry points and in all classrooms. Classes and halls will be full of signage and directional arrows. Teachers will have to enforce calm classrooms as “singing, cheering and loud voices” are against the rules for kindergarten students this year at Niagara Catholic sites, said the board’s plan. Students will have their own individual learning materials and sharing will be limited, both boards said. Niagara Catholic has suspended use of musical instruments such as the recorder and DSBN will make sure each student has their own to use to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public board has not banned any specific instruments. No learning activities related to vocal music, choir or playing of musical instruments will take place during in-person class instruction within Niagara Catholic facilities, but students can sign them out to practise at home. DSBN is “working with public health and the Ontario Music guidelines to make sure all of the proper COVID-19 measures are in place,” said chief communications officer Kim Yielding. Physical education is still being offered, but with COVID-19 protocols put into place, she said. When DSBN schools open their doors next Tuesday, “students and staff alike will be entering into a new world of education in Niagara,” Yielding said. “In previous years, the first day of school would begin with students of all grades milling around outside of the school, swapping summer stories and waiting to go in,” she added. Now students will be starting their day with COVID-19 self-assessments and, depending on their grade, will be wearing masks. DSBN has turned off taps to water fountains, but Niagara Catholic will offer students hydration stations because they are touchless and automatically pour water when a bottle is put under them. “It will be new for everyone, but we will all embrace these new procedures because they are for the good of everyone in our community,” said Yielding. Provincial laws say children in kindergarten to Grade 3 are encouraged to wear cloth masks, but they aren’t mandatory.

Approaches could include staggered bell times, and maximizing the use of all possible entrances and exits at the start and end of weekdays.

For the past week she’s been collecting data in an online survey, which she says has been taken by more than 1,000 parents and educators. “I’ve heard from a broad spectrum of people who are concerned about classroom sizes,” said Stevens, an NDP member. “They need to know it’s going to be safe.” Some school boards in Ontario, including Toronto District, have been critical of the province’s plans. Stevens said she’s disappointed Niagara’s boards haven’t been involved in “some kind of a push-back” against what she called a “vulnerable position we might be putting our kids in.” Asked about class sizes, District School Board of Niagara spokeswoman Carolyn Loconte said the board isn’t able to share what the average will be or if a cap for elementary rooms will be implemented. She said that depends on the outcome of a special meeting Monday night, called by the board of trustees to consider a recommendation to use an additional one per cent of the board’s accumulated surplus to reduce class sizes by hiring new teachers. Niagara Catholic District School Board spokeswoman Jennifer Pellegrini also said information on class sizes, and whether more teachers will be hired, won’t be known until early next week after senior management meets. Both boards are two of 24 in the province that are following the provincial government’s adaptive model at the secondary level when classes resume after Labour Day. The format will divide students into two groups and classrooms won’t exceed a population of 15, both boards have said in their plans available online. For Niagara Catholic high school pupils, Cohort A will attend in-person classes Monday, Tuesday and every other Wednesday. Cohort B will attend in-person Thursdays, Fridays and every other Wednesday. The days they are not in school, they will be learning at home, the board says. Following a four-period schedule, they will take one class for a full day for 22 days, write a final exam or assessment, then move on to the next class for 22 days, according to the Catholic board’s plan. Cohorts are also part of DSBN’s strategy, for those who have chosen to return to class. The public board and Niagara Catholic are following the same schedule. While in school, 225 minutes worth of education will be provided. Students will be told to put in 300 minutes of learning when at home. Following Labour Day, for Niagara Catholic elementary students’ first week, those in kindergarten to Grade 8 whose last name begins with the letters A to L will be in school Tuesday and Wednesday, and at home Thursday and Friday. Those whose surnames start with M to Z will be at home Tuesday and Wednesday but in class Thursday and Friday. All will begin full weeks of classes starting Sept. 14, as will online learning for students opting out of in-person education, reads Niagara Catholic’s Back to School Plan. At DSBN sites, kindergarten and Grade 1 students will be back Tuesday after Labour Day. Wednesday will see kindergarten to Grade 3 classrooms filled with students, and Thursday will mark the start of the academic year for students in kindergarten through Grade 6. By Friday, all elementary students will be back in class. The provincial government has mandated students in Grades 4 and up are required to wear masks indoors. At the elementary level, 20 per cent of DSBN students have signed up for virtual schooling. It’s slightly less among secondary students. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Classrooms are being organized to reflect physical distancing, with “unnecessary furniture already removed from schools to optimize space,” said Loconte. The public board has printed “thousands of signs” to post in schools “that will reinforce physical distancing, proper hygiene practices, directional flow in the schools, and other reminders of the new safety and health protocol students and staff will follow,” she added. The Catholic board’s enrolment numbers will not be available until next week. Kris Dubé is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

With back-to-school just over a week away, Niagara Region Public Health received guidance from the province this week on how to manage cases and outbreaks in schools. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara’s acting medical officer of health, said the public health unit will approach cases and outbreaks in schools in a similar way to other settings. If someone is sick, they’ll be sent home. “If there’s a child or a teacher who develops symptoms, they can’t stay in school. They need to be isolated,” Hirji said. “Schools will have a place to isolate children until a parent can pick them up and they have to head home.” The child will need to be assessed by a health care provider, who will determine if the symptoms are likely to be COVID-19 or not. If COVID-19 is suspected, it will be recommended they get tested. Hirji said it’s up to a parent if they want to have their child go through with the testing or not. If a child is tested and found to be positive for COVID-19, they will need to be isolated for 14 days. If they aren’t tested, they will still need to be isolated for 14 days on the precaution that they could have the virus. In cases where a physician rules out COVID-19, either from the initial exam or through testing, the child will have to stay home until they are no longer sick and wait an additional 24 hours before going back to school. Public health will follow up with schools where someone has tested positive for COVID-19. Officials will do contact tracing to try to identify if the source came from inside the school or somewhere else. They’ll also determine who the child could have spread the infection to, and look at having that group isolated. “Doing that will have to be done on a case-by-case basis,” Hirji said. “It could be the entire class or the entire cohort could be isolated as a result of that.” How many people are isolated depends on who the child is spending much of their time with and what kinds of classroom, recess and physical education activities have taken place. If there are two positive cases in one school believed to be linked, an outbreak will be declared. An outbreak doesn’t necessarily trigger an entire school shutdown, however. Hirji said that would only happen if there was an ongoing spread of infection and it was deemed necessary to send everyone home to stop the spread. More likely, certain classes or cohorts would be sent home during an outbreak. The public health unit will have 16 new public health nurses funded by the province, in addition to its existing complement of about 20, working with schools to help them open safely.

They may need some additional support and help to cope with the adaptation.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Think of all the places across Niagara that are potential hot spots for a COVID-19 explosion — beaches, big retail stores, schools once they reopen — and Clifton Hill is the Mount Everest of them all. Weekends and most weeknights, thousands of people are drawn to its lights, rides, stores, tourist traps and fast food. To a lot of outsiders it is the face of Niagara. But geez, it makes us nervous these days. We are not suggesting it be closed during the pandemic (though it is easy to imagine a scenario, albeit extreme, where that might be necessary). But can we at least agree that having so-called volunteer ambassadors roaming around wearing brightly coloured T-shirts and offering masks and hand sanitizer is a weak response? For months we have all been told and told and told to wear masks, keep our hands clean and cover our coughs. Yet each night many people there are not wearing masks, even in areas such as arcades and some attractions which, while they might have an open entrance are really still indoor venues where a face covering should be worn. Clifton Hill remains an outdoor attraction — but it’s an outdoor attraction like no other. Unlike Canada’s Wonderland or some other amusement park that is privately owned and where mask-wearing can be required and enforced, Clifton Hill is largely public property. Mask-wearing can only be mandated indoors there, yet most of the thousands of people visiting spend a majority of their time mingling on the sidewalks and sometimes the street itself. Is there some legal way, at some level of government, where Clifton Hill could receive a special designation requiring masks everywhere, indoors and out, from the top of the hill to the bottom? How about limiting the number of people allowed on Clifton Hill? It might require fencing at the top and bottom, with security guards controlling foot traffic. At the same time — and we have suggested this previously — eliminate vehicle traffic on Clifton Hill so it can be used like a pedestrian mall. When things are hopping, that street is much too busy with people anyway to allow cars and trucks to also use it. Why not make it pedestrian-only on Friday nights and weekends, when it’s at its busiest? Heck, instead of festive T-shirts, dressing the ambassadors in lab coats might be a better way to remind people we are still in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. This week, Niagara’s public health department said so far no large COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to Clifton Hill. But it “absolutely remains a concern,” said Dr. Mustafa Hirji. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Clifton Hill crowds still pose COVID-19 risk, says Niagara’s acting medical officer of health Aug. 31, 2020 Editorial It’s time for Canada to adopt a new stance on China Sep. 01, 2020 Editorial The promise and challenge of Leslyn Lewis Aug. 31, 2020 “I think we have gotten lucky, and if you look at what is happening in Western Canada, where they are not doing anything drastically different than we are here, they are into a second wave of infections.” Yet, the risk Clifton Hill presents — with its crowds, hands-on games and attractions, tight spaces, long lineups — would make effective contact-tracing nearly impossible when people are infected. A majority of visitors there come from out of town, around the GTA and farther out across the province. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... While the potential for spread on the Hill cannot be eliminated, every step possible must be taken to reduce it so visitors don’t take COVID-19 home with them and spread it around the province. There is still another good month or so, mostly weekends, when Clifton Hill will likely be packed. We’ve been fortunate so far, but we shouldn’t rely on luck to see us the rest of the way.

The ambassador program spearheaded by toen Couns. Gary Burroughs and Wendy Cheropita is meant to be welcoming and cautious at the same time. “The concept is to welcome people to town, first of all, and then outline what we would like them to do regarding masks and shields and social distancing and hand sanitizing,” Burroughs said. Both councillors and the town teamed up with the Shaw Guild to launch the program that will operate until Sept. 13 on Wednesday and Friday to Sunday between noon and 6 p.m. “We all agree as councillors that it is critically important that we protect our citizens, and we have a lot of people coming into Niagara-on-the-Lake obviously through tourism, and we thought it would be difficult to just do it through our enforcement officers,” Cheropita said. The idea to team with the Shaw Guild came about because the organization normally has 325 volunteers helping during an active Shaw Festival season, and they have the experience of greeting guests and understand how to organize and schedule. Laurie Harley, president of the Shaw Guild, said the organization’s mandate is to support the Shaw but due to COVID-19 it hasn’t been able to do that. “We also have a mandate to be visible in the community because when we support the community, we’re also supporting the Shaw Festival,” Harley said. This program fit with that mandate. “Plus, we have a group of extremely talented, enthusiastic and sometimes a little bored volunteers who we thought would be eager to participate in a pilot,” Harley said. The volunteers are paired in twos, wearing blue shirts that display the town logo and Shaw Guild logo. They’re given specific designated routes near entry points off Queen Street to be a welcoming face to the town. Both Burroughs and Cheropita said the volunteers are not enforcement officers. “They’re not telling anybody to do anything. They’re simply advising (visitors) and welcoming them,” Burroughs said. “The intention (is) that the ambassadors would be greeters to present a friendly face, to welcome visitors to our community to help with our intention of compliance of the social distancing regulations,” Cheropita said. They’re positioned to educate the public about physical distancing, the requirement to wear a mask indoors and when distancing can’t be maintained outside, and to use hand sanitizer before entering a restaurant or shop. Burroughs said the greeters will also thank visitors and residents for following rules and guidelines. The program will be evaluated by the two councillors with feedback from the Shaw Guild.

For weeks, scientists in laboratories around the planet have, after enormous efforts and billions of dollars in funding, reported heartening progress in finding that silver bullet — a safe, effective, widely available vaccine. Indeed, 13 experimental vaccines are currently in clinical trials, feeding expectations that an illness that has killed more than 880,000 people can — in the not-too-distant future — be brought under control. But last Friday, the World Health Organization fired off a statement that brought those sky-high expectations crashing back to Earth. The WHO does not expect widespread vaccinations against COVID-19 to be available until the middle of next year. Agency spokesperson Margaret Harris said none of the candidate vaccines in any of those advanced clinical trials has demonstrated a “clear signal” of efficacy at the level of at least 50 per cent that is being sought by the WHO. That’s not what the world wanted to hear. But it’s the reality check the world needs. While nobody can accurately predict the future, this is no time to let our guard down when it comes to COVID-19. After lockdowns, border closures, face masks and social distancing drove down the number of new COVID-19 cases in Canada, new infections are spiking upwards again. So, too, they are in many other countries, including the United States. It’s as if in the middle of fighting a three-alarm blaze, some of us dropped our extinguishers before the fire trucks had arrived. Canadians must be patient. They must remain vigilant and continue obeying the rules set down by public health officials. If they don’t, they might face a COVID-19 surge that forces another lockdown. There will be many who hope the WHO turns out to be wrong. After all, last week, American health officials and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said a vaccine could be available for distribution as early as late October — well in advance of November’s U.S. presidential election. But the WHO’s main reason for its words of caution is that the proper trials must deliver the correct results before any vaccine is approved. The history of vaccines that were rushed into use too quickly and with tragic results proves why the WHO is correct. In the 1950s, some 40,000 children contracted polio after receiving a dose of the vaccine that accidentally contained a live virus. Ten youngsters died. A decade later, thousands of children who received a particular inactivated vaccine against measles and were then exposed to the actual measles virus became seriously ill, some requiring hospitalization. That’s why the world can’t rush an anti-COVID-19 vaccine into widespread production and use before public health authorities are convinced it’s safe and effective. It’s vital that Canadians, along with people in other countries around the world, agree to be vaccinated when those conditions are met. Rushing a bad, improperly tested vaccine into use before that happens could embolden anti-vaxxers and make it harder to achieve the widespread immunity essential for beating COVID-19. Sadly, vaccines have become highly political south of the border. Donald Trump wants a vaccine available for American voters before they decide his fate in November’s presidential election. But it’s not about him and we can only hope American health officials agree. It’s often said that all good things are worth waiting for. Considering the world’s health is at stake, it’s worth waiting for a good vaccine. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

That came to an end Tuesday when school officially resumed. Niagara District School Board chair Sue Barnett, as well as Niagara Catholic District School Board education director Camillo Cipriano, indicated the first day of school went through without any glitches. “I’ve been checking my emails all day and haven’t seen any that indicated that there were any concerns raised by senior administration or board trustees,” said Barnett. Cipriano, who took the helm of Niagara Catholic last week, had the same experience. “It went well. I was at St. Teresa of Calcutta Elementary School in St Catharines. I know it was only one school and one experience, but everyone was happy and excited to be back.” Cipriano said students who will be learning online will be starting classes next Monday. “Thirteen to 16 per cent of families have indicated that their children will proceed with online learning,” he said. “The majority of the remaining students have indicated that they will be learning in class.” DSBN communications officer Kim Yielding provided context for how students will be learning this semester. “(Public board) elementary schools have 21,000 students in class and 5,200 students online. Both panels will have a staggered start this week,” she said. “Secondary schools have 10,000 students in class of the adaptive learning model and 2,100 students will be online.” St. Catharines regional Coun. Laura Ip told her son, who just started Grade 10, “no one has ever done school like this before.” “Not me, not your dad, not your teachers, not anyone. Do your best. This is like building the plane while we’re flying it. Be patient with yourself. Be patient with your teachers. Have a super great day.” she told him. “I think I am more stressed than my child, but I also felt like I needed to say something to him,” she said of the experience of sending a child to school in the unprecedented COVID-19 era.

The Ward 4 councillor also said he didn’t like the results he was getting from questions asked of city staff. “I think the people of Welland have done a fantastic job and are taking some responsibilities of their own … with COVID and social distancing and such,” he said during Tuesday’s city council meeting. But he said it seems things at Welland Community Wellness Complex were being reopened by staff and not to the liking of citizens and made reference to the billiards room inside the Lincoln Street facility. Dan Degazio, general manager of economic development and recreation, agreed with DiMarco about residents doing their part and being responsible when it comes to taking COVID-19 precautions. At the wellness complex, “We’re only running 20 to 25 programs right now, programs that are allowed to run,” Degazio said, noting the centre usually provides 150 programs. Degazio said some of the programs availablkle now include socially-distanced yoga, one-on-one pickleball — players usetheir own balls and play at set times — and badminton, run similarly to pickleball. “Our computer lab, which is well used, isn’t open right now. We’re not running card games either.” Degazio said with the constant touching of billiard balls, table rails and felt and cues, a staff person would have to be in the room at all times, cleaning and sanitizing. “People are cautiously coming back into the facility. Once we get a handle on things and see how many people are coming in we’ll look at the billiards room. It’s not a high priority compared to other programs.” He said the city’s goal is to ensure its staff and the public are safe. “I’m not prepared to have our staff held liable,” Degazio said.

Both buildings at the site have been part of the historic year-round market for decades until March when the doors were locked by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. They will reopen Saturday. Before the pandemic, the market would serve its first customers at 6 a.m. It will continue to open two hours later at 8 a.m. this Saturday, as it has since reopening with physical distancing protocols in place July 11 — only at outdoor spaces at the site. Patrons are still reminded to physically distance and to abide by Niagara Region’s mandatory indoor mask bylaw. Dalton said under the new setup the market will be able to accommodate more than 80 per cent of the vendors it would welcome normally. He said the city will be updating its website weekly with a list of expected vendors who are ready to return. The list will “grow in the coming weeks,” he added. The market isn’t the only city-operated facility expanding its operation in the near future. On Aug. 31, the wellness complex on Lincoln Street will start to offer programing slowly, with registration for activities opening Sept. 3. The city’s program roster will grow in 2021 as more programs will become available with the winter program session, said a news release from the municipality. A new online version of the city’s wellness guide will launch Aug. 28. At the Welland main arena on King Street, hockey moms and dads will have to decide who gets to give the pre-game or practice pep talk in the car on the way to the rink. It will open Sept. 8, but only one parent or caregiver per child is allowed to enter the arena during registered ice-time, a way to control the rule that no more than 50 people are allowed in an indoor space, the city’s news release said. Recreation and culture staff will be on site to perform temperature screenings at the facility entrance and assist with hand sanitization, said the city. “We’re confident that our Return to Play procedures will create an environment where people feel protected and can enjoy themselves,” said Dalton.

Closed since mid-March, the building will resume operations Monday, Aug. 31. with “modified” programs and services. Recreation and culture manager Richard Dalton said it will be a “controlled opening” to ensure proper COVID-19 protocol. Usually, about 100 programs would be available at the wellness complex. Dalton said there will be more than 20 fitness classes available and four drop-in sports programs — badminton, shuffleboard, table tennis and pickleball. There will be four arts and culture/fitness drop-in programs — sassy scrappers, woodcarving, chat and craft, and tai chi. The city expects to make an announcement about outdoor and off-site programming soon, he said. The woodshop and fitness room are not part of the first phase of the opening. The complex has about 2,500 members who use the facility. Close to 800 responded to a survey to gauge interest in how the site should start welcoming the public again. “A lot of members really want to come back to our facility,” said Dalton while noting physical distancing and staff’s ability to sanitize surfaces were two of the most common pieces of feedback received. “They want to make sure the standards are high in terms of safety.” A new online version of the wellness guide will launch Friday, with online registration beginning Sept. 3. Some activities are on hold until further notice to “limit issues with distancing,” said Dalton. The city’s program roster will grow in 2021 with the winter session. “All these things are pieces of the puzzle we’re putting together.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region A number of Welland facilities to remain closed Jul. 21, 2020 Health Future of Welland Community Wellness Complex programming in the hands of residents Jul. 29, 2020 The annual membership fee for Welland residents is $30 and $38 for people who live outside the city.

The Welland theatre group that was founded about six years ago and has been running an production annually since then at the wellness complex on Lincoln Street has postponed its plans twice already. A performance of “Backstage,” was on the schedule for the spring, but was expected to hit the stage in September. That, too, is not happening and the group is keeping its eye on the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor what its next steps might be, said chair Jeff Etling. “It’s up in the air while we can figure out what’s going on,” he said. Before having to axe the production for this year, it had been cast and rehearsed. Sets were being built, said Etling. Canalside Players is a subcommittee of the city’s recreation and culture department and gets a small budget from the local government, said Etling. The theatre group hosts between 100 and 200 people at each performance at the wellness complex, which has been closed since mid-March. It opens Aug. 31, city staff have confirmed.

The 2021 Canada Games Host Society voted to postpone until 2022 the events planned for next August, ensuring when the events do take place in the region they will live up to expectations, said the organization’s chairman, Doug Hamilton. “I think it’s a timely and prudent decision. It was a difficult decision, but I think it’s the right decision to make at this time,” he said Wednesday. Hamilton said the Canada Games Council voted unanimously Friday to postpone the games, pending the decision of the Niagara-based 2021 Canada Games Host Society. The local group met Wednesday morning “and also unanimously approved the postponement until 2022,” he added. “The decision, while it was made by the board, it was done in collaboration with a lot of our stakeholders who were all in support of it as well.” Also consulted were Niagara Region and the provincial and federal governments. Hamilton said the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed some of the efforts to prepare for the events, and although work was proceeding on the construction of Canada Games Park near Brock University, at best the facility would only be “Games ready” by the time events took place. “They (the facilities) weren’t going to be completely ready for the Games in 2021 anyway. Now they will be,” he said. “In other areas we’ve made excellent progress, but some areas like the community engagement program for our events, and our sponsorships have been slowed down by the pandemic.” Meanwhile, there were concerns about the availability of Canadian athletes able to participate in the national sports events, as a result of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics being delayed to 2021. If the Games organization had pressed on with plans to hold events in 2021, Hamilton said it likely would not have lived up to expectations of attracting 5,000 participants and 4,000 volunteers participating in the largest multi-sport event in the country. “If we had to host the Games next summer, first of all there would have been a concern about the health and safety of participants. This allows us to reduce that uncertainty and two years from now, we’re all hopeful we’ll be in a much better position of participants and spectators that will be attending the Games,” he said. “That would have hindered our ability to lever the extraordinary Games experience for all participants and spectators, and we very much want to do that.” The decision to delay the events for a year “will allow us to recover and stage the phenomenal Games that we’re all hoping to host,” Hamilton said. In a statement, Region Chair Jim Bradley offered his support of postponement. “The 2021 Canada Summer Games has not been immune to the effects of the pandemic, with the coronavirus negatively affecting the time line for Games-related construction projects, the ability to recruit volunteers and the ability to secure vital sponsorship and fundraising dollars,” he said. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “The pandemic has also prevented athletes from training and qualifying in many sports, and the limitations currently in place regarding the gathering of large groups pose numerous challenges.” Bradley said the delay will “not only ensure that Niagara will be ready to successfully host the country, but will also help alleviate some of the financial pressures being felt by the host society and all of the municipal partners.” He called it a “positive decision” that will help guarantee the Summer Games will be “the best it can possibly be.” Niagara West MPP Sam Oosterhoff discussed the postponement at Queen’s Park, Wednesday, pointing out Ontario’s $29-million investment, cost-shared with the federal government, as well as an ongoing commitment to the events. RELATED STORIES Council Pandemic’s impact on Niagara’s Canada Summer Games cause for concern Sep. 09, 2020 Another COVID-19 postponement: Canada Summer Games pushed back to 2022 “Being an athlete during COVID-19 is no easy job,” he said. “Ontario is home to some of the greatest athletes in the world that have performed at some of the highest levels of competition.” Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister Lisa MacLeod said the safety of participants is top priority. “Therefore, I will be supporting the Canada Games Council if they do decide to postpone those Games and we will commit as the Ontario government to pursue those Games in 2022 if that’s required,” she said. Hamilton said the pause will allow organizers to relax in some of the areas where they have managed to all but finalize preparations for the events, and refocus efforts on preparations that have been delayed. “We’re going to continue full out because the extra year will allow us to do that much better,” he said. “It does give us a sigh of relief. While it’s disappointing, it does give us that extra runway and we’re looking forward to using it to make the Games even more phenomenal.” The postponement will not have an impact on future Canada Games events. The Canada Winter Games on Prince Edward Island will continue on schedule in early 2023. Allan Benner is a St. Catharines-based reporter with the Standard.

In a Thursday night news release, the Niagara District Catholic School Board said a person at Mary Ward Catholic school has tested positive for a novel coronavirus infection. The release does not say if that person, who is now in isolation, is a student or staff. However, it does say that students and staff have been potentially exposed to the virus. “Niagara Region Public Health is in the process of contacting all students and staff who had direct contact with this individual this evening,” the release says. “Anyone who came into contact with this individual is advised to stay at home tomorrow and to follow the advice of Niagara Region Public Health.” The school’s principal has sent a letter home to students’ parents to inform them of the situation. This is the second educational facility to report a positive COVID-19 case this week. On Wednesday, Brock University reported a off-campus student has tested positive for the virus. The university said this student had not yet been on campus. Since testing positive, the student is in isolation. The Mary Ward case is the first in a Niagara school since classes resumed after a pandemic shutdown. Earlier in the pandemic, a secondary school reported a positive case.

A week earlier, council voted to accept a recommendation from a consultant hired to review council’s pay structure, a recommendation which included a pay hike of 46.9 per cent. That overturned a previous decision made in August rejecting the increase. “I wish to rescind my vote,” said Ward 5 Coun. Graham Speck this week, after requesting the rules of procedure be waived in order for him to bring forward the reconsideration. Speck’s motion to reopen the issue required two-thirds of councillors to vote in support. Voting against taking another look at raising councillors’ pay to $27,884 from $18,981, and the mayor’s to $76,208 from $72,995, were Ward 2 Coun. Leo Van Vliet, Ward 3 Coun. John Chiocchio, Ward 4 Coun. Bryan Green, Ward 5 Coun. Claudette Richard and Ward 6 Couns. Bonnie Fokkens and Jim Larouche. No further discussion on the matter took place during the virtual meeting after Speck’s motion was lost. In an email Wednesday, Speck said his “first responsibility” is to his constituents. “They do not want this to happen now and as their councillor I must do everything in my power to reverse this decision,” he wrote. “Council has the opportunity to do the right thing,” he added. Speck said he plans to continue attempts to reverse the decision, and has been told by the clerk’s office his next opportunity to do so will be Oct. 1. Members of council have earned cost-of-living increases over the years, but it has been three decades since the last formal council pay review occurred in Welland. The decision to increase remuneration for individual councillors by 46.9 per cent has drawn considerable blowback from the public, including on social media. It has also drawn critical comment from the union representing city transit workers. Last week, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1633 president Chris Moore said he’d been receiving numerous calls from members about the decision. “They’re entitled to it like everybody else, but it raises a lot of questions and concerns with everything else going on,” Moore said, referring to the pandemic and the fact there are still transit staff laid off as a result. Getting people back to work should be a bigger priority than council pay, he said. “Why are there people still sitting at home and they’re getting a raise?” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Mayor Frank Campion said last week he plans to reallocate his annual increase to the city or to a local charity. In August, council was told by a consultant that in municipalities with populations between 50,000 and 99,999 mayors earn an average of $81,550, while councillors earn an average of $37,884. The increased salaries are in line with what local politicians in a city of Welland’s size should target, Marianne Love, of ML Consulting, said. In Welland, the third-largest lower-tier municipality in Niagara with a population of 52,293 according to the 2016 census, council is made up of 12 ward councillors from six wards plus the mayor.

Bonnie Fokkens Sep. 07, 2020 The pay raise will provide Welland councillors with higher remuneration than their colleagues in St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. In St. Catharines, a city with a population of more than 133,000 as of the 2016 census, councillors are paid $24,174.60, up from $23,413.68 in 2019. There are 12 councillors from six wards plus the mayor. In Niagara Falls, with a population of 88,071 in 2016, councillors receive $25,541.67 annually. The Falls has eight councillors and a mayor. The councillors are elected at large. Welland council rejected the recommended pay increase in August with nine councillors voting it down. When a reconsideration motion was brought forward by Green on Sept. 1, four councillors changed their minds and supported it — Green, Speck, Fokkens and Richard. In favour all along have been Ward 1 Coun. Mary Ann Grimaldi, Van Vliet, Chiocchio and Larouche. Against the move are Campion, Ward 1 Coun. Adam Moote, Ward 2 Coun. David McLeod, Ward 3 Coun. Lucas Spinosa and Ward 4 Coun. Tony DiMarco. Kris Dubé is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

I said to myself, this is all to do with the pandemic. I also thought about the people without work, don’t know what is going to happen with their children and school, finding it more difficult each day to provide food for their family and others losing their homes and apartments. I wondered how much longer will this continue. Then I returned home and opened the paper and read what Welland councillors did for themselves, not only the amount but when they did it. This shows a total disrespect towards the citizens of Welland as well as a slap in the face to everyone trying to endure this difficult time. Welland, it’s time to wake up. Council, enjoy the time left in this term. Mark Dzugan Welland Who’s going to pay for the labour utopia? Re: Labour Day is an opportunity to rally for a stronger Canada, letters, Sept. 4 While it’s impossible to fault the vision of a fair and equitable society where no one is left behind, just who is going to pay for this utopia? The solutions appear to depend on governments, federal, provincial and local, investing even more in “replace(ing)lost jobs with better ones, by hiring people to build green infrastructure, to educate our youth, to care for others — and to give workers paid sick leave and a living wage.” Additionally it requires “a strengthening of public health care to include mental health, pharmacare and home care, and an end to privatization in the long-term care sector” and also “reforms to employment insurance, disability benefits, education and training, as well as pensions to make all of these more secure and reliable ...” The same governments, who have spent the past six months and more spending money they don’t have, to support communities impacted by COVID-19, driving up municipal, regional, provincial and federal debts. The largest groups of contributors to any government’s tax base are small businesses. Small local businesses have been decimated by COVID-19, largely because of restrictions that have prevented them from operating. While many in the public sector have been protected, the private sector has not. Those who do survive know they will soon face even larger tax bills to pay for governments’ COVID-19 spending.

Although only a single confirmed case of the virus was reported in Niagara on Saturday — it followed several days of increasing cases of COVID-19 in the region, with as many as a dozen people testing positive for the virus on Thursday. On Friday, Hirji told The Standard that the region was “looking at it and having discussions about making that request of the province,” hoping to prevent large increases experienced in other jurisdictions as a result of social gatherings such as parties and weddings. The province’s new restrictions limit the size of gatherings to 10 people at an indoor event, down from 50, and 25 people outdoors, down from 100. Merged indoor and outdoor events for a total of 35 people are also not permitted. The province previously imposed the same restrictions on hot-spot areas, including Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa. The District School Board of Niagara also reported an individual at Eastdale Secondary School in Welland tested positive for the virus — the second case at a Niagara school since classes resumed. An individual at Mary Ward Catholic School in Niagara Falls tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. The DSBN said in a media release that a Niagara Region public health inspector and nurse are scheduled to visit the school on Monday, adding the school would undergo a “deep cleaning” by school custodians during the weekend. The new province-wide restrictions will not apply to staffed businesses and facilities, such as bars, restaurants, cinemas, convention centres, banquet halls, gyms, places of worship, recreational sporting or performing art events.

The Ministry of Health adjusted its tune less than a week ago, saying no more than 10 people are allowed at indoor events — a sharp reduction from the previous limit of 50. Outdoor events are capped at 25 now rather than 100. The province says the new rules affect “unmonitored” gatherings like parties, dinners, barbecues and wedding receptions held in private residences, backyards, parks and other recreational areas. Welland has not handed out any fines since mid-March. But when interviewed Thursday, Ali Khan, the city's supervisor of traffic, parking, and bylaw enforcement, said an $880 fine could be given if necessary. “If it warrants a ticket, we will issue a ticket. If it warrants an education piece, then we will educate them,” said Khan. In the past, Khan stressed the importance of education. Thursday, a few days after the reduction in crowd limits, he said it is key to act on complaints “case by case.” He said Wellanders have been “fantastic” throughout the pandemic. No complaints have been heard by the city in the last week. Niagara Regional Police, which handles complaints in the evening, continues to work with municipal bylaw staff to enforce emergency orders issued by the province, said spokesperson Stephanie Sabourin. To date, the NRP has issued five fines in relation to the emergency orders “as the bulk of the enforcement has been undertaken by municipal bylaw” departments, she said. Indoor and outdoor events and gatherings cannot be merged. Gatherings of 35, (25 outdoors and 10 indoors) are not permitted, according to the province. Port Colborne Mayor Bill Steele said there is no excuse not to follow the government’s requuirements. “People can’t claim ignorance now. We’re long into this game,” he said Thursday. He is OK with the city’s bylaw department issuing fines. “If you break the rules at this point, you probably deserve a ticket,” he said. Steele commended the people of Niagara for their compliance with physical distancing and a region-wide mandatory mask bylaw.

In a statement, the city’s bylaw department says it will continue to monitor complaints and concerns related to social gathering limits during hours of operation.

Our first step is to always try and achieve compliance through education,” reads the statement. Kris Dubé is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

The figures from the group COVID Ecoles Quebec and the Ontario government came as authorities seek ways to curb the spread of COVID-19 among younger people. Data from Ontario show cases among those in their 20s have risen sharply in the past month, with one expert attributing the increase in part to the reopening of schools and universities. In an effort to tackle the problem, several provinces, cities and universities have warned of stiff fines for violating anti-COVID restrictions. However, Quebec said it would not allow police to enter homes without a warrant to break up gatherings that violate the measures. The worrisome upward trend in new cases came as the federal Liberal government laid out its plan to take on the second wave. “To prevent small clusters from becoming major outbreaks, communities may need to enact short-term closure orders,” the government said in its throne speech. Stringent lockdowns in the spring caused unprecedented economic disruption, prompting the government to spend tens of billions of dollars on supports as unemployment skyrocketed. The throne speech promised, among other things, an extension of the federal wage-subsidy program until next summer, more aid for businesses and help to boost testing capacity. People in various cities have waited for hours or even days for virus testing. Safety concerns led a hospital in Kitchener, Ont., to close its drive-thru testing centre as people arrived in the wee hours. In all, COVID-19 has killed about 9,250 people in Canada, while the cumulative case count has been edging toward the 150,000 mark. Quebec, with more than 69,000 cases, accounts for about 48 per cent of the total cases but 63 per cent of the deaths. Ontario’s more than 48,000 reported cases account for 33 per cent nationally, and 31 per cent of fatalities Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... On Wednesday, Quebec reported 471 new cases. Another four reported deaths from the novel coronavirus brought the province’s total fatalities to 5,809. Ontario, which has shown a steady increase in new cases since mid-August, after months of declines, reported 335 new cases Wednesday and another three deaths. Almost 70 per cent of new infections were in people under the age of 40. Concern is also mounting as more long-term care homes in Ontario, brutally hit by the virus earlier in the year, report outbreaks. Almost 70 per cent of fatalities have been among those aged 80 and older and another 27 per cent were 60 to 79 years of age. While older people and those with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to severe illnesses from SARS-CoV-2, younger people can spread the disease — often before showing any symptoms. “When there’s so much in the community, it can escalate into the populations with more vulnerability,” Dr. Vera Etches, medical officer of health in Ottawa, one of the harder hit cities, said. Ontario data indicates new cases among people in their 20s have reached similar levels to those seen among people in their 80s in mid-April. Along with school reopenings, Dr. Brian Ward, a professor of medicine at McGill University, cited bars and parties as key factors, along with a “general sense of invulnerability” among younger people. “COVID fatigue also clearly plays a role,” Ward said. Winnipeg, for example, accounted for 30 of Manitoba’s 42 new cases reported Wednesday, with possible exposures at restaurants, bars and a pub trivia night, the province said. Trudeau sympathized with Canadians feeling the stress of a second wave, but urged people to be strong. “’Can’t’ will not define us,” he said. “We can bend the curve. We can build a stronger future. We can define the change.” Read more about: Justin Trudeau SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The Ministry of Health reported another 401 infections Friday as new restrictions limited indoor gatherings to 10 people and outdoor ones to 25 in the key breeding grounds of Toronto, Peel and Ottawa, which were home to 68 per cent of the new cases. “We’re going to be rolling out other areas across the province from the request of the mayors,” Ford told a news conference in Ottawa, calling the leap in cases this week “very concerning.” He did not name any municipalities, but London — where there has been an outbreak of cases among Western University students partying in bars, restaurants and private homes — and York Region were expected to be on the list after pleas from both. Outside the hot spots of Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa, indoor gatherings of 50 and outdoor gatherings of 100 are still allowed with physical distancing. Fines for violating the limits are rising to $10,000 for party organizers and $750 for anyone in attendance. In London, Mayor Ed Holder referred to the 47 new cases in the last week — including 30 since Wednesday alone — as the biggest local spike since April. “The reality of where we find ourselves right now is undeniable and unnerving,” he told a news conference Friday, warning additional measures could be invoked locally “if this recent surge is not reversed.” Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti said Ford “did not cast the net far and wide enough” by excluding York Region from the lower limits announced Thursday for neighbouring Toronto. York had 40 new cases in Friday’s report. The daily tally of 401 cases is up substantially from 293 on Thursday and the recent high of 315 the previous day as public health officials become increasingly worried over the rapid spread of the highly contagious virus, which has led to long lines at testing centres. “I understand people are anxious,” Ford said, noting pharmacies will be providing tests to people without symptoms of COVID-19 “by this time next week.” That will leave hospital-based assessment centres clear for people with symptoms of the virus. Opposition parties said Ontario is losing more ground daily in fighting the pandemic despite knowing cases were likely to surge in September. “It should never have come to this,” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath. “Now, again, the province is chasing a crisis instead of getting out in front of it. We can’t wait.” Ford promised a plan to deal with the rising number of cases will be unveiled next week. “Instead of building up our testing system for this inevitable upswing, the premier spent the summer on a campaign tour patting himself on the back,” said Green Leader Mike Schreiner. “Ford’s second-wave plan will be useless if the horse has already left the barn.” With more than 50 per cent of cases now having no known source, infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch of University Health Network said contact tracing must be improved to get a better idea of where and how COVID-19 is spreading so that chains of transmission can be shut down. “We can be proactive,” Bogoch said. For the first time in several days, no new deaths were reported Friday and hospitalizations increased by five people to 58 across the province, with 20 requiring intensive care and 10 of them on ventilators, well within the capacity of the health-care system. There were 130 new cases in Toronto, 82 in Peel and 61 in Ottawa, while 15 of the province’s 34 health units had no new cases. There were 19 in Halton, eight in Durham, 10 in Simcoe-Muskoka (cottage country including areas south of Barrie), 12 in Middlesex-London, nine in Waterloo and eight in Niagara.

Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara’s acting medical officer of health, said new measures to restrict personal gatherings in Toronto, Peel and Ottawa — expected to be announced by Doug Ford on Thursday — will be how Ontario tries to put out COVID-19 fires. “It is a better approach than a full return to Stage 2 or a provincewide lockdown,” said Hirji. “This is what we can expect going forward.” Personal gatherings where people were not physically distancing, wearing masks or practising hand hygiene have fuelled a rise in cases in Ontario, particularly in those three cities. Toronto public health, for instance, is tracking four weddings which may have caused at least 22 COVID-19 infections. To get control of the situation before case growth gets out of control, Ford said Wednesday that new restrictions on personal gatherings will be imposed on those cities. Hirji said distancing, handwashing and masks have worked well in restaurants and stores where staff and customers alike are taking the steps necessary to protect each other. “We really haven’t seen many cases arising out of businesses. That appears to have worked quite well,” Hirji said. “Personal gatherings is where the issue is.” That said, Hirji said both the model of limiting personal gatherings and the messaging around it have been confusing and likely needs to change if Ontario is to prevent further spread of the virus. Currently, the provincial government says a person’s social circle should be limited to 10 people. Gatherings inside are limited to 50 people and outdoors to 100, although in both cases physical distancing is required and masks necessary indoors. Hirji said the limit of a circle of 10 people may be too difficult for many Ontarians to adhere to, particularly those with large extended families. He said it may be time for the province to expand the size of the social circles while simultaneously reduce the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings. Hirji said tackling a rise in cases region by region rather than provincewide is likely the best way the province can handle the situation without pushing all of Ontario back into more restrictive lockdowns. He noted some northern communities do not have the same COVID-19 issues found in the GTA or Ottawa, and imposing further restrictions upon them would neither be fair nor productive. He said short-term restrictions could help a community get COVID-19 infections under control, while allowing unaffected regions to continue with its current level of social and economic activity. However, he said the government has not disclosed how it is making decisions about what regions will face new restrictions. The St. Catharines Standard has asked Ontario Health about what public health indicators it is using, and how they inform its pandemic decisions. The ministry has repeatedly declined to disclose that information. “Some greater transparency around those metrics would be helpful,” Hirji said. While it is not clear what metrics could trigger provincial government action, it does not appear Niagara would face that kind of action at this time. Niagara has seen a slight increase in daily cases in the past two weeks, the region has not experienced a significant rise in cases. There was one new case confirmed Tuesday and three on Wednesday, bringing Niagara’s historic total of COVID-19 infections to 973. At least 64 people with the virus have died since March. In Niagara, in the cases where public health has been able to identify the source of virus contact, COVID-19 has been spread largely within the same households as opposed to at personal gatherings. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... However, about 35 per cent of recent cases have no known origin of exposure. Hirji said Niagara should be paying close attention to the restrictions being imposed on other Ontario regions, as well as the more expansive second wave lockdowns in other countries, and learn from those examples. Niagara residents’ dedication to COVID-19 control measures have helped keep the infection rate low, reducing the risk of community spread.

The board has not indicated if this third person at the school is a staff member or student. The two previous cases identified at the Welland high school were staff members, according to a provincially maintained database listing school-related COVID-19 cases in Ontario. Contact tracing assessment by Niagara public health has not revealed any additional contacts, said the school board release. No additional staff or students will be required to self-isolate. On Monday, public health completed a thorough assessment of the school and advised then that no further health and safety measures were required. On Sept. 21, public health officially declared an outbreak at Eastdale with the confirmation of its second case. As a result, five classrooms were closed. People who encountered the individuals are now in a 14-day quarantine. Eastdale and the board will continue to work with public health and the school community will continue preventative COVID-19 practices such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, and daily health screening, said the release. This marks the fifth school-related COVID-19 case in Niagara since classes resumed on Sept. 8. Three schools have been involved. Three of the five confirmed cases were identified by the Ministry of Education website as staff or teachers. The first COVID-19 case hit Niagara schools on Sept. 17 at Mary Ward Catholic Elementary School in Niagara Falls. Then on Wednesday, the DSBN reported a case had been identified at William H. Merritt Public School on Linwell Road in St. Catharines. Both elementary school cases have also been identified by the provincial database as being staff persons. Loading...

She said when the market reopened in June, city staff worked with Niagara Region Public Health to ensure best practices and safety measures were implemented for vendors and customers. That included limiting the number of customers allowed in the market at one time, making sure vendors were positioned appropriately to maintain social distancing and only allowing essential items to be sold, including produce and agriculture businesses. “We can’t thank the community enough for their support this summer,” said Grigg. “It was great to see the number of people who continued to shop local, and we hope to see the same support and enthusiasm next year.” The market, which connects the community with area farmers and vendors, is typically open every Friday from October through May from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from May to October from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. Its final day is Friday, Oct. 30, from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Market Square across from city hall on Charlotte Street. The city release said to celebrate and thank the community for its support, it’s putting on a spooktacular twist. City staff will be handing out a delicious treat — keeping in mind all COVID-19 health and safety protocols — to any child visiting the market in their Halloween costume. As well, a limited quantity of pumpkins will be handed out for free to children to take home and decorate. Information on when the farmers market will reopen next year is being finalized. Loading...

Known to regulars as The Egg Man, he was one of five retailers on Saturday who were operating indoors in the west building at market square, one of two on the property. It was his second week back since the city took another step by reopening the doors to both after outdoor spaces started to return July 11. It’s been busy and Packham likes what he has seen so far. “People are coming and buying, and there’s lots of room for them to move around,” he said. Shortly before 10:30 a.m., a line of about 10 people formed along vendors on the east side of the building while people coming in walked past following directional arrows pointed to the north. Having to adapt to the pandemic and losing his weekly market sales, Packham opened his farm in the Dunnville area to the public. He was glad to see familiar faces from Welland. “We still had a lot of customers coming up there, and we appreciate that,” he said. Krista Bowie, community development and volunteer co-ordinator for the City of Welland, who spent months laid off during the pandemic but is back and in a new role of overseeing the market, said an estimated 500 people visited the previous Saturday. This weekend’s numbers seemed on pace to be the same, she said. Normally this time of year, the market would have around 60 vendors operating in early September. There were 30 open for business Saturday. The indoor space on the east side of the property was at capacity with seven vendors, and the west building has room for 12 — which is expected to see two more return next Saturday and and another the following week, both Bowie and market attendant Lisa Frost said. During the first week of reopening, the outside parameter of market square was barricaded. That set up “didn’t go well,” said Bowie, adding that it filtered people on arrival to one entrance. “It was too restrictive in terms of accessibility,” she said. This week, people could park in the main lot and not have to walk around to the north end to enter. Volunteers sat at exits telling people they could not enter on Saturday, directing them to the doors facing south. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “Now, it’s more of a free-range approach,” she said, noting directional arrows and the provincial rule that no more than 50 masked people are allowed in at once. People are familiar with physical distancing obligations, almost six months since the start of the pandemic. “They’re used to it by now. They’re doing it in other stores and other locations,” said Bowie. She said the city is aiming to keep the limit at about 30.

Wineries of Niagara-on-the-Lake, an organization that brings more than 20 town wineries together, held a recent meeting to discuss what they can do to keep the outdoor experience alive as temperatures drop. On the other side, a small handful of restaurants recently sent a letter to NOTL council, hoping to have the extended patio permit deadline of Oct. 31 moved into November or beyond. “Me and a couple (of) other restaurant owners sent in a letter, just asking to extend the patio season in case we do end up with a beautiful fall,” said Kim Gauld, co-owner of Sunset Grill on Queen Street. Gauld also sits on the NOTL chamber of commerce board and has been at the forefront of the heritage district merchant group since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’ve even asked if (council) can give us an early notice of an extension to next year so we can start planning ahead,” Gauld said. Her restaurant has invested in outdoor heaters on the patio, and although expensive, she said it has helped a little. Other restaurant owners have also thought of making the investment, but want to confirm patio permits are extended to make sure they aren’t making a large purchase for only a month’s use. Andrea Kaiser, chair of Wineries of Niagara-on-the-Lake, said members met two weeks ago to discuss heaters, among other things. “A lot of the wineries had heard on the news that it was becoming virtually impossible to actually order outdoor heaters, so we frantically, a number of us, went online to order some heaters,” Kaiser said. With COVID-19 cases on the rise across Ontario and Premier Doug Ford saying the province is officially in the second wave, wineries are hoping they’ll be considered an essential business if another lockdown occurs. “I would say anxieties like other businesses are high and certainly the unknowns always provide for more stress when you don’t know what’s going to happen and you can’t sort of make a plan,” Kaiser said. But the organization, along with its members, is trying to be proactive and look at every scenario to best position themselves to “weather the storm,” Kaiser said. . Wineries being able to keep their stores open for curbside pickup, Kaiser said, proved to be a lifesaver earlier this year. Home deliveries of wines also exploded, and it was a major help for those town wineries that don’t have distribution across Ontario. Virtual tastings also grew much more popular and will most likely be continued, with or without a second lockdown. The biggest excitement for wineries is the ability to present their signature “Taste the Season” event, through an at-home experience. Kaiser called it “Taste the Season at Home,” which will be released Oct. 1. While the at-home experience will be crucial for those who don’t feel comfortable leaving their residences, wineries are hoping to make outdoor seating as comfortable as possible beyond the purchase of heaters. “We have a number of wineries that are looking at some really unique, and I think really exciting, winter programs because Canadians, Ontarians — even if we do hit a second wave (of the) pandemic, they will still be seeking outdoor experiences if allowed,” Kaiser said. The examples Kaiser provided of programs included cross-country skiing or snowshoeing in a vineyard, or offering mulled wines or warm beverages while sitting outdoors.

While each day potentially presents a new change or an unknown, restaurants and wineries in town are continuing to follow safety and health protocols put forward by public health. Kaiser said some wineries have even mandated that masks be worn outdoors and only be removed when being seated on patios. It’s a guessing game of what tomorrow could look like for restaurants and wineries, but they’re hopeful patio season becomes much more than a summer trend.

Councillors unanimously passed a motion by St. Patrick’s Coun. Mat Siscoe this week calling on the upper levels of government to create a relief stream specifically targeted to the food and hospitality industry. “The simple reality is with drastically reduced occupancy in dining rooms, it’s going to be very hard for businesses to stay afloat,” Siscoe said during Monday’s council meeting. He said the hospitality industry employs more than a million people in Canada and is a significant employer in Ontario and in the community. Margins are thin at the best of times. He said when upper levels of government first created COVID-19 relief programs they were broad-based and generalized, but it’s now clear some industries are going to be particularly disadvantaged due to the pandemic for much longer than others. “Even as we are in Stage 3 and we’re seeing openings and business returning to whatever this new normal is for many industries, in the hospitality and dining industry that’s simply not the case,” Siscoe said. “The consumer confidence is not there. People are still very hesitant. The reality is, takeout and patios are not going to be able to keep these businesses going.” City council previously waived all fees associated with seasonal patios to help restaurants through the pandemic. The city also closed down part of St. Paul Street to create a pedestrian walkway so patios could spread out their tables to allow for physical distancing. St. Patrick’s Coun. Karrie Porter said efforts have made a tremendous difference but the crisis is very deep and requires more federal investment. “Restaurants are the heart of our downtown and the heart of our ward in downtown St. Catharines and we need to do everything possible to keep them afloat,” she said. “It’s important to call on all levels of government to add more support.” RELATED STORIES Business A second-wave shutdown will devastate Niagara’s service industry, chambers of commerce warn Sep. 15, 2020 Business Niagara chambers join campaign to preserve local restaurants during COVID-19 Aug. 29, 2020 Council Stretch of downtown St. Catharines to become pedestrian walkway Jun. 23, 2020 The motion passed by council asks the federal and provincial governments to create a relief stream for the industry that includes forgivable grants, an industry-specific wage subsidy program, long-term low-interest loans, targeted rent relief and any other possible relief programs. It also asks that the relief be available until the food and hospitality industry is able to safely return to full operations. The request will be forwarded to all local area MPs and MPPs and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

The problem is the physical distancing required to keep patrons safe during COVID-19, according to a Statistics Canada survey. Forced to work at reduced capacity to provide more space for patrons, 60 per cent of accommodation and food services either haven’t reopened and probably won’t or have reopened but say they can hang on only another 90 days. “Shocking, but not surprising,” said Hugo Chesshire, director of policy and government relations for the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. “Even before COVID-19 you were looking at profit margins at full-service restaurants that could be as low as 1.2 per cent across the country. You’re literally better off putting your money into a savings account instead of a restaurant, based on profitability.” When the unexpected happens — like a pandemic — “there’s obviously no room to absorb any extra cost there.” “Ask people to think about their favourite restaurant,” he said, “and by Christmas there is almost a two-in-three chance that it could be closed.” GNCC as well as the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce, representing Niagara Falls, Fort Erie, Welland/Pelham and Port Colborne/Wainfleet, have signed onto the national chamber of commerce’s Our Restaurants campaign, urging people to support local establishments and calling for more government help. Justin Duc, who co-owns the OddBar and OddBird restaurants in downtown St. Catharines, said it’s been “incredibly” difficult for owners to keep venues running under current circumstances. OddBar, on King Street, reopened with a patio and takeout service while indoor capacity was reduced to 10 from 40. The smaller OddBird, on St. Paul Street, hasn’t reopened its dining room and works solely on patio and takeout. “Sixty per cent seems high,” he said of the StatsCan number. “I know quite a few restaurant owners, none of them have any plans to close within the next little while. I think everyone is doing OK. “But it’s hard, not everyone has been able to bring back all their staff. I know that’s been weighing heavily on people.” He said OddBird “benefited greatly” when the city closed part of St. Paul Street on weekends to create a pedestrian mall. In Niagara Falls, the city did the same thing with Queen Street and Centre Street. With business neighbours Brass Monkey and Ludology, OddBird owners tried to create a little festival-like area outside, bringing live entertainment to perform on the street on Sundays. “We’re trying to figure out what a winter version would look like if we rent heaters and tried to create almost a Christmas market atmosphere,” he said. With takeout, patios have been a saviour for many restaurants but they only work in good weather. This winter, he said, is “going to be interesting.” According to StatsCan, across Niagara the accommodation and food services industry employed about 24,800 people in July 2019 but only 14,800 last month. That was 1,700 more than in June.

They also want Ottawa to extend its emergency commercial rent assistance plan, and to implement a moratorium on commercial rental evictions.

Yes, precautions are taken: The landowner, in this case Ontario Power Generation, works with City of St. Catharines and Niagara Region outreach workers to be compassionate. The people are given 10 days notice, and the outreach workers return regularly to help them prepare to move. It’s done as nicely as possible. But where does a homeless person move to? Governments across North America struggle with the question. And finding an answer has been made more complicated this year by the presence of COVID-19. In the spring, the Out of the Cold program was forced to close early over concerns the virus could spread quickly among people sleeping in fairly close quarters. Then through the summer, many of the places they would normally spend parts of their days — libraries, coffee shops, community centres — were off limits, again to contain the spread of COVID-19. Drop-in centres and meal programs that help people who are on the street or just in need, had to adapt, too, so large crowds didn’t congregate inside. Groups in the community have done an admirable job in stepping up to find shelter for people who want it, and supplies and food for everyone who needs it. But with winter coming soon, the problem remains. When Out of the Cold starts up again in a few weeks — adapted to keep people as socially distanced as possible, and with other anti-COVID measures in place — it will at least provide a place to sleep. But the days are long. If Niagara is unable to contain the growth of new coronavirus cases, it’s possible some sort of modified lockdown could be imposed similar to what happened earlier. Sure, the provincial government wants to do it without hurting businesses too badly. It’s important to protect people’s jobs and their investment. But if the plan involves further limiting indoor gatherings, then people who are homeless will once again be out of luck and on the street. But there are positives, too. Local government and community people continue to work to find permanent housing for those who need it, but it can be a difficult, sometimes expensive job. In a few weeks, a program led by pastor Bill DeGuire called Outreach and Engagement in Homeless Services will start, aimed a preparing outreach workers and others who encounter homeless people through their work. And in downtown St. Catharines, the STEPs program at St. George’s Anglican Church works with young people from all across Niagara who are living on the street or struggling with mental health or addictions. Its goal is to help them find direction in their lives while they are still young. And two other positive events happened this week. First, Niagara Region’s public health and social services committee supported plans to expand REACH Niagara, which offers primary medical care to people without a home. Second, a survey conducted by Niagara Region to collect public feedback on what the Region’s spending priorities should be found the majority of respondents favour more action to help homeless people. Small steps, sure. But that’s how this issue will be sorted out. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... We might refer to them as Niagara’s homeless community, but it’s a collection of individuals with different needs, abilities and life stories. Not all of them want four walls and a roof over their head, either. But they are all members of our community, and each deserves the help they need to live safely in a way they choose.

The Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite said the event that has been serving his agency, as well as Open Arms Mission and the local Salvation Army, for about 20 years is “very important” heading into the winter months. It not being held would have a “real impact on our ability to provide services,” he said. Annually the food is collected then brought back to Auberge Richelieu for sorting by dozens of volunteers. Alain Breton, one of three main organizers of the food drive, said the committee behind the event is having regular talks on how and when to proceed — but is still eyeing the first week of November. A drive-thru food drive is being considered, as is sending people on routes directly to the three agencies that benefit with their respective hauls. Asked if it could be cancelled, he said, “it’s a possibility, definitely.” But he expects a plan will be reached within two weeks and the event will be held in some capacity. “A lot of people are suffering.” Braithwaite said the number of people seeking food security at the start of the pandemic wasn’t noticeably different when compared to that time of year in 2019, but added that the amount of food distributed recently has gone up by about 450 kilograms per month. He expects this trend to continue as government assistance for people starts to decrease. “We’re embracing for what we expect to be a very hectic fall,” he said, adding a 50 per cent increase could be possible. In July, 11,350 kilograms of food were handed out through a takeout window at The Hope Centre on King Street. The food bank will continue to operate this way for the next couple of months, Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Braithwaite said he has had discussions with the annual food drive organizers and is willing to adapt to a different format. “I’m confident they’ll find a way,” he said. Drive-thru food drives, such as two hosted by Wesley United Church recently, have been more than appreciated. Other small food drives, as well as support from United Way and Food Banks Canada, have been helpful keeping the shelves stocked, he said. But this also needs to keep going. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “If things escalate, as we expect them to, then we’re going to have to rely on the community to continue to support us,” he said. A door-to-door food drive hosted by Open Arms Mission in late April brought in 14,840 kg of food for the Welland organization. A third of it was consumed by clients in July, alone. “We are pushing through all of that food,” said mission executive director Marty Misener, while also stressing how crucial the November drive is for his agency.

Open Arms is sending people home with more as a result of its cooler located on a rural property in Wainfleet. Last July, people would receive about 12.6 kg in groceries, but now they are getting 15.75 kg, Misener said. Open Arms Mission supported 492 clients in July, 38 per cent of them families with children. The total number of visits is “about the same” when mirrored against last July. With winter on its way, one area of concern for Misener and his team is finding a way to keep people from having to line up outside in the cold and snow. “We’re beginning to discuss plans on how we can invite people into our facility in a safe manner, adhering to government regulations,” he said. He expects the need in the city will be “remaining high” for the next few months. Kris Dubé is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

But the way the annual drive, held to restock the shelves at Port Cares Reach Out Centre, is run changed this year due to the pandemic and moved up a week as well. Slat doesn’t want a repeat of last year’s drive, delayed by a week after a massive storm on Halloween left debris and fallen trees on roads across the city. It will take place on Saturday, Oct. 24, and will run out of Christian Life Assembly Church at 484 Barrick Rd. Unlike years past, there will no volunteers inside the church hall sorting the non-perishable food items donated by both Port Colborne and Wainfleet residents. The food drive is held in conjunction with Wainfleet Lions Club. Slat said there’s no way to keep people safe as they sort the items in close contact in the hall. “We couldn’t figure out how to do it.” Without volunteers to check the items, Slat is asking people who donate to double-check expiry dates on anything they leave out. “That will have to fall on Port Cares’ shoulders,” she said of expiry dates being checked. Residents are asked to leave donations on doorsteps or clearly visible locations by those picking things up on the various routes across the city. Things have changed for people picking up the donations, as well. In years past, drivers would have a random group of volunteers — high school students, firefighters, scout or brownie groups — go with them. “It’s a bit harder now. Drivers will have to have people with them that are already in their social bubble,” said Slat, adding gloves will be worn by those picking up items, as will masks. “We want to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy.” She asked that residents to leave items in bags or boxes. Pickup starts at 9 a.m. “We won’t be knocking on doors or looping back on routes.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Most of Port Colborne will be covered. People living in Sherkston, Gasoline, Bethel and Wainfleet are asked to take donations directly to the Reach Out Centre at 61 Nickel St., Christian Life Assembly or make arrangements with a friend or family members to have the goods dropped off. Residents can also contact the Reach Out Centre directly at 905-835-1914. Slat said there should be Lions members and Port Cares staff at both locations until noon. All items collected at the church, which supports the food drive, will be stored in a transport trailer, provided each year by Fontaine Transport Inc., and left in quarantine for three days.

Slat asked that cheques be mailed directly to Port Cares, 92 Charlotte St., L3K 3E1, and put in the memo section: for Port Colborne Lions Club Food Drive. In her second year as food drive co-ordinator, Slat wanted to recognize Jan Fuaco and said she’s been an important part of the planning team this year and insisted on staying involved even though she recently lost her husband, Dan. Dan, a club member for more than 25 years, was the chair of the food drive for 20 years working with his wife to ensure things ran smoothly. Slat said with the food drive date moved up a week, she encouraged Lions Club members to share club Facebook page posts with as many people as possible on social media. “The more we can get the word out, the better it is for us. We’re relying on word of mouth.” Items needed include pasta and sauce, peanut butter, jam, baby food, diapers, formula, toiletries, canned fruit and vegetables, canned meat plus items for the children’s lunch program, such as fruit and pudding cups, peanut-free granola bars, healthy snacks and juice boxes.

We believe council should vote yes. It should extend the bylaw so masks are required in places such as elevators in residential and public buildings and in apartment building lobbies and common rooms. If any organization is still holding indoor, in-person group meetings on private property, the bylaw should also require masks be worn there as well. The anti-maskers won’t be happy. Actually, none of us will. No one enjoys wearing a mask when they go shopping or to a restaurant or out to see a movie. They’re uncomfortable, it gets hot under there. Even remembering to pack one when you go out is a pain. Every one of us looks forward to the day when the risk of contracting COVID-19 is diminished and we don’t have to wear masks anymore. But we’re a long way from that point, and Niagara’s daily count of new coronavirus cases continues to go up. And we’re doing well, comparatively. Or at least not as badly as places such as Toronto, Ottawa, Peel and York, which have been put back into modified economic shutdown because they’re seeing so many new cases. In Niagara, St. Catharines was first off the mark to require masks be worn in indoor public places. Soon after, Niagara Region followed with its own regionwide bylaw. St. Catharines has already extended its original order to include those same places regional councillors will consider Thursday. As unnatural and uncomfortable as mask-wearing can be, the fact is there are no arguments against it that can counter the fact we are in a worldwide pandemic that right now is getting worse, not better. Across Niagara, at least 68 people have died, as have more than 3,000 in Ontario and nearly 10,000 across Canada. And that is basically since early March. Medical experts strongly recommend wearing masks, more so to protect others than the wearer’s own health. There is a bogus theory of herd immunity — that if enough people contract COVID-19, survive and develop protective antibodies, the virus will fade away and eventually disappear. To accept that as the answer, you must be prepared to accept thousands more deaths along the way, deaths that can be avoided by adhering to strict public health rules. Instead of herd immunity, how about herd compliance? Wear the mask for now (along with physical distancing, hand washing, staying home when you are sick) as a means of holding off the coronavirus until a vaccine can be made widely available. The objective is still to keep as many people alive as possible, right? RELATED STORIES Editorial Declaration calling for end to lockdowns is about politics, not public health Oct. 20, 2020 Editorial COVID-19 teaches Doug Ford hard fiscal lessons Oct. 19, 2020 Editorial Plight of Niagara’s homeless worsened by the pandemic Oct. 17, 2020 Anti-maskers argue the sight of adults wearing masks is confusing and frightening for children. It doesn’t have to be, if you take time to explain to them why we’re in masks. They argue masks don’t provide protection. We will side with the experts, who say masks do work. They argue masks are an infringement on our freedom. Actually, the opposite is true. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... If masks weren’t widely used in public, very likely our COVID-19 case count would be much higher, possibly leading to the kind of economic shutdown businesspeople dread might still happen. If you’re already wearing one in stores and malls and restaurants, why would you not put one on in an apartment lobby or elevator? Masks are inconvenient and uncomfortable, but if wearing them sometimes is what it takes to get us through this, then Thursday’s debate at regional council should be short.

If you appreciate good journalism, please subscribe to stcatharinesstandard.ca or niagarafallsreview.ca or wellandtribune.ca for unlimited access to all articles. Niagara’s COVID-19 infection rate continued its recent stabilizing trend Friday with only eight new confirmed cases, although a critical pandemic metric has continued to rise. The number of new cases Friday dipped back into single digits after four straight days of double-digit case increases. That case growth, while in keeping with the trend of the past two weeks, has resulted in Niagara’s reproductive number to rise. The reproductive number is an estimate of how many other people a single infected person will make sick in a community. The public health department wants to keep that figure no higher than one. On Oct. 17, it was 0.79 but as of Friday it had risen to 1.2. In the summer, a greenhouse outbreak drove the local reproductive number above two, prompting the province to delay moving Niagara into the next phase of economic reopening. Niagara’s acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, has said he believes the province will take a series of metrics into account before imposing new pandemic restrictions if the number of COVID-19 cases starts to rise even further. It is not clear, however, what metrics the provincial government is watching, nor what thresholds it has established to determine if new action has to be taken in a community. Friday’s cases bring Niagara’s cumulative COVID-19 total to 1,311, with 86 still active. Four people are being treated at the St. Catharines hospital for COVID-19. At least 69 Niagara residents with the virus have died since March. Grant LaFleche is a St. Catharines-based investigative reporter with the Standard.

The corporate leadership team made the decision not to go ahead this year, to ensure public safety and be in compliance with provincial COVID-19 restrictions that strictly limit attendance at events, said Krista Bowie, Welland’s community development and volunteer coordinator. The Rose City’s parade usually takes place the third weekend of November. Bowie said a “reverse parade” wasn’t considered as a substitute for the annual event. The City of Niagara Falls is moving forward with a drive-through event that will see dancers, jugglers, stilt walkers, superheroes, musicians, colourful inflatables, community groups and Santa Claus himself stationed outside city hall to greet passersby in their vehicles and city buses. Bowie said the city wasn’t sure if a similar idea would draw participants to Welland, or how it could be done logistically while keeping everyone safe. “It didn’t make sense for us,” she said. Instead, the city will focus on smaller events that will allow more control over social distancing but still provide for a community celebration around the holidays. The first will be a Christmas tree lighting at Civic Square, 60 East Main St., on Wednesday, Nov. 25 at 6 p.m. The tree, donated to the city and standing nearly two storeys tall, is usually lit at the end of the Santa Claus parade. Bowie said this year’s ceremony, by invite only, will be livestreamed and held in partnership with the Niagara Health Foundation to help promote its annual Celebration of Lights fundraising event. Despite COVID-19 keeping Santa away from the parade, he’ll still pay a visit to the Rose City during Zoom visits on two Saturdays, Dec. 5 and 12. The visit, held in partnership with Welland Downtown BIA, will see Santa spend time with up to 25 families on the call. “Children will be able to interact with Santa, and we’re hoping to do photos by screenshot,” said Bowie, adding further details are to come in next two weeks. Welland residents can also take self-guided and registered bus tours during the Welland Winter Lights contest on Monday, Dec. 7 and Tuesday, Dec. 8. Bowie said the city cancelled New Year’s Eve celebrations at Welland Community Wellness Complex and Welland Arena this year. The event typically draws up to 2,000 people between the two sites. In Port Colborne, city staff decided to cancel the annual Santa Claus parade, held the first weekend of December. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “It wasn’t an easy decision to call off the annual Santa Claus parade, but as we continue to navigate COVID-19 we’re making operational decisions that we feel are best for the community,” said Ashley Grigg, director of community and economic development. She said the holiday season will look different, but it’s hoped new ideas including Christmas Market, a home decorating contest and Grand Old Christmas take-home kits will keep the Christmas spirit flowing. Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum will spread Christmas cheer Sunday, Dec. 6, with Grand Old Christmas take-home kits instead of the annual event held on the grounds. More details on the kits and how to purchase them will be available soon. Residents are encouraged to take part in the first Christmas Market at Market Square on Friday, Dec. 11 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. It will feature various local farmers and artisan vendors selling products.

McCoy made a card flip through the air out of a deck he was holding in one of his hands and with a bit of sleight of hand made a card picked by Jackson Lodge switch inside the tuque the boy was wearing. The magician was part of the 19th annual Children's New Year's Eve Bash at the Lincoln Street complex. The event ran 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and included a free family skate at Welland Arena. Krista Bowie, the city's community development and volunteer co-ordinator, said fireworks scheduled to end the free event had to be cancelled due to high wind gusts. She said inside the complex there was a nine-hole mini-putt golf course, London Reptiles, a photo booth, treats, face painting, Shriners making balloons for all of the children, characters from the Disney film ""Frozen,"" a jousting pit and giant inflatables inside the theatre. ""We're jamming in here now,"" she said, as Welland families came through the doors. There were big lineups for both the face painting and free candy floss. Bowie said Club Rex had a dinosaur exhibit at the arena for children and free popcorn for everyone. She estimated between the arena and complex, at least 1,500 people came out to take part in the fun. While admission was free, donations of non-perishable food and canned goods for local food banks were accepted. People were encouraged to share their New Year's Eve photos from the evening on social media using #WellandNYE2020. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

The jolly man in red was the guest of honour during the annual Welland Santa Claus Parade on East Main Street, ending at city hall where he met with hundreds of people. The chilly weather didn't stop spectators from lining the street to enjoy a procession of bright and festive floats. Canada Post volunteers, who work very closely with Santa during the holiday season to ensure all letters from children reach him at the North Pole before Christmas, collected wish lists as they walked the parade. The mayor's youth advisory council collected donations for Open Arms Mission. After the parade ended the celebration continued with a showing of ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" movie on the city's outdoor big screen. There was also free hot chocolate to warm people up and sweet treats. Children were able to create holiday crafts, have their faces painted and have some one-on-one time with Santa.

The local police service posted a Tweet Thursday morning urging people to stay home rather than come to Niagara Falls to celebrate the end of 2020 and that officers were investigating the party bus event. The bus is scheduled to make stops in Toronto, North York, Scarborough, Brampton, Mississauga and other communities before arriving in Niagara Falls. “We are investigating. This is not in accordance with #COVID19 regulations. #StayHome #StaySafe,” says the tweet. “I should caveat this by saying under most circumstances we do not discuss any details of an ongoing investigation, and this is an ongoing investigation,” said NRP spokesman Const. Phil Gavin. “But in this case we wanted to draw people’s attention to this. And if there is another charter bus out there planning to do this, they may think twice about it now.” The bus event comes as the province remains in a pandemic lockdown, which started on Dec. 26, in a bid to bring the escalating COVID-19 infection rate under control. In Niagara, the pandemic dam has broken with several days this week setting new records for new daily infections, deaths and outbreaks. Local hospitalizations are at a pandemic record high and the region’s acting medical officer of health says there will likely be another surge in cases as a result of Christmas gatherings. As of Thursday, at least 3,951 local people have been infected by the novel coronavirus. At least 142 Niagara residents with COVID-19 have died since the first local case was identified in March — 77 of those people have died since Oct. 5 when the second pandemic wave began to gain steam. The provincial government and public health authorities have been urging people to keep holiday gatherings small, limited to their households. Non-essential businesses are closed, including almost all of the attractions in the Niagara Falls tourist district which typically attract New Year’s Eve revellers. The casinos are closed, the Festival of Lights is shuttered and restaurants are open for take-out only. Gavin said the NRP is working with GTA police services to investigate the party bus and said if the event goes ahead, officers will not hesitate to fine the company or party-goers under the Reopening Ontario Act, the provincial legislation under which COVID-19 restrictions are ordered. Under the act, fines of to up to $500,000 can be handed out to violators. In addition to the party bus investigation, Gavin said officers will be out in force across Niagara both to handle the typical New Year’s issues of impaired driving and other bad behaviour and to enforce COVID-19 laws. Several hotels, which remain open during the lockdown, have hired off-duty NRP officers to be stationed in their buildings to ensure COVID-19 rules are followed, he said. “If you are booking a room under your name, and we knock on the door and find 30 in there, it is not going to be hard to figure out who the organizers of that event is,” Gavin said. “If it comes to it, we will engage in enforcement.” Loading...

While police try to prevent Niagara Falls from becoming party central and risk even more COVID-19 infections, some local hotels are actively promoting their facilities as a place to celebrate the end of the year. The Four Points by Sheraton in Niagara Falls, for example, promoted a New Year’s Eve package on its website and Twitter account Thursday. When asked about the promotion during a lockdown on Twitter, the hotel blocked the reporter who posted the question. Calls to the hotel were not immediately returned Thursday.

Life Drive-by birthday parade surprises 10-year-old Welland boy By Kris DubéTribune Reporter Fri., Jan. 1, 2021timer1 min. read Planning a birthday party for her son Jake has always been a challenge for Valerie Azotini. The Welland boy was born New Year’s Day, a time when families are winding down from Christmas and have several other family events planned. On Friday, to celebrate his 10thbirthday, Azontini invited about 20 of her son’s closest friends and family to participate in a drive-by parade in front of their Crowland Avenue home, covered in balloons and various decorations to ring in the big day. Jake had no clue his mother was putting together the parade, but grew suspicious when his 11-year-old sister Eden played along and told him she had to show him something on the porch. Enough time passed until he realized Eden didn’t actually have anything. He thought someone was on their way to deliver him birthday greetings. “I thought it was just going to be one person giving me a gift — but then 20 people came,” he said, grinning ear to ear. “We waited here for five minutes, and I heard a bunch of honking,” said the Grade 4 student at École élémentaire catholique Saint-François-d’Assise. “I was really happy.” Jake became emotional when he recognized some of his friends. He ran to cars to accept cards from people, most wearing masks and gloves. His mom said she makes an effort to keep a distance between Christmas and Jake’s birthday. After Christmas decorations are taken down from their tree, it’s converted into a “birthday tree.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Purolator goes ’above and beyond’ for Welland boy’s birthday Jun. 18, 2020 She said she wanted to brighten his day and get 2021 off to a cheerful start, adding it has been difficult over the past decade holding a birthday party a week after Christmas. “It’s hard normally to get his friends together, and now you add COVID to it?” she said.

Nolan Rouillard prefers courier vehicles delivering packages from Amazon. Celebrating his 12th birthday on this past weekend, the Welland boy living with special needs — he has cri-du-chat syndrome, a rare genetic condition caused by the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 —was given a surprise that took him on an emotional ride. His family arranged for Rob Valentine, a local Purolator driver, to be the grand finale of a drive-by parade held for the boy in north Welland Sunday. He parked at the start out the route, away from their house, and all Nolan's gifts were loaded into the back of his truck. When he arrived at the end of the driveway, Nolan was overwhelmed, his mother Ashley said. ""He was ecstatic, shaking and couldn't get on the truck fast enough."" Keeping an eye on the neighbourhood and watching for deliveries is one of Nolan's favourite things to do. ""He watches for Amazon every day, even if there isn't a package coming,"" she said. Valentine decorated his truck and even delivered some gifts for Nolan on behalf of the company, including a Purolator-themed Lego set. He also brought him a Purolator water bottle and tuque. ""They didn't have to do this. They went above and beyond,"" said Rouillard, extremely appreciative of the gesture and the company sending a driver to her son's party. ""They're busy right now, working a lot of hours."" Valentine said he was delighted to participate, a result of a Facebook post: Nolan's family was looking for a way to feed his love for delivery trucks on his birthday. ""I just feel bad for kids right now. They can't go anywhere. They can't do anything,"" said Valentine, adding he ""can't imagine"" what the pandemic is like for a child with special needs. The reaction from Nolan when he arrived was very special. ""He was just jacked right up when he got in that truck,"" Valentine said. - Child's enthusiasm for port-a-potties touches hearts Loading...

In a memo to staff obtained by the Welland Tribune, human resources manager Andrea Daisley advised of the confirmed case, saying the employee last worked on Nov. 13 and is now at home in self-isolation. Niagara Region Public Health is conducting contact tracing on the individual, and has not advised the municipality that other workers could have potentially been exposed. The city is “monitoring the situation closely,” Daisley wrote. “We remind all staff to continue to take the appropriate precautions including frequent hand washing, wearing a mask, and physical distancing,” she added. Greg Brady, Unifor 199 president, represents all outdoor workers at the City of Welland. In an interview Thursday, he said his office was made aware of the case earlier this week and that there are no major concerns with the matter. The employee carried out his tasks alone for at least the past two weeks. “Apparently, the member had been working by himself for the last little while,” said Brady. “We don’t have any idea on who it is, and they wouldn’t elaborate on who the member is or where he worked,” said Brady, referring to communication with the city. No grievances have been filed by any union members regarding the confirmed COVID-19 case, he said. “Nobody seems to be upset or frantic about the situation right now,” he said. “So far, the city is adhering to whatever public health guidelines that need to be put in place,” Brady told the Tribune, stressing the “employer is taking the proper steps.” In an interview Thursday, Daisley said she could not elaborate on the staff member’s specific tasks, but also confirmed that person has “primarily worked on their own” in recent weeks.

Planning and organizing behind the scenes at Niagara’s city halls was intense. Here’s a brief overview of what the three largest Niagara municipalities faced as the year unfolded. ST. CATHARINES St. Catharines chuef administrative officer Shelley Chemnitz said each year municipalities assess the risk of potential threats such as floods and earthquakes. St. Catharines noticed in fall 2019 that the pandemic risk was on the rise and began monitoring the situation in January. It started preparing for the worst, such as hanging on to decommissioned computers instead of auctioning them off in case employees were sent home to work and didn’t have laptops. In an organization that provides such things as building permits and wedding ceremonies, the leadership team had to assess what was essential, what could be provided remotely and what would have to be put on hold. “It was a balancing act all the way through,” Chemnitz said. “We needed to look at what can we do safety and what are the financial consequences of that but on the other hand what does the community need, what does business need?” St. Catharines started shutting down its community and recreation centres four days before the province declared a state of emergency in March. While the city could plan as best as possible, a financial hit couldn’t be avoided. By June, the city was estimating a $10.5-million COVID-19 impact by year’s end due to revenue shortfalls and added expenses. Mitigation measures, including temporary layoffs, and federal and provincial emergency funding helped close the gap and the city will not carry an operating deficit into 2021. NIAGARA FALLS In Niagara Falls, finance director Tiffany Clark said revenues were down as income from user fees declined, interest rates were lower and the casinos have been closed since mid-March. Expenses are also down, she said, due to “purposeful mitigation” taken by the city, such as staff layoffs, minimal to no conferences, and less professional development and travel expenses. Clark said some costs for cleaning and security increased, while fuel prices decreased, which was “somewhat” related to the pandemic. The city received about $4.3 million from the provincial and federal governments to deal with operating pressures in 2020 and 2021, along with $1.9 million for transit-related support. Trent Dark, human resources director for the city, said the municipality had laid off 142 people since March. About 12 positions remain laid off and the city has 29 vacant budgeted positions across the corporation. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The municipality delayed the spring recall of seasonal and casual labourers, said Dark. He said Niagara Falls did not hire for 32 summer student positions and eight co-op positions. “We have had 26 retirements this year, to date. We have staggered shifts, reviewed redundancies, redeployed staff and encouraged working from home arrangements, where feasible. We estimate the above actions have resulted in approximate cost expenditure savings of over $2 million in salaries and benefits.” Erik Nickel, the city’s director of municipal works, said capital projects were “largely” unaffected by the pandemic. He said a few municipal parks and recreational projects were “slightly” delayed due to the provincial pause on non-essential construction, however, work resumed as soon as practical. Nickel said only one major project was postponed, for at least one year — construction of a roundabout at the intersection of Whirlpool Road and Niagara River Parkway. WELLAND Welland Mayor Frank Campion said the city has been able to weather the pandemic storm fairly well. “From a financial perspective, staff and council implemented several cost-control measures which enabled the city to finish the year without a deficit. Provincial and federal funding helped with this as well,” said Campion. He said senior staff monitor budget pressures and have implemented cost-containment measures as needed. The city cut back on transit and laid staff off across all departments throughout the year to save money. Tthe city saw provincial and public health orders impact its ability to provide many programs, particularly in the area of recreation and culture. “These are some of the programs most used by residents, and so this impacts their daily lives,” said Campion.

But quality products are still being made at the Welland factory, and customers are still in need of what they offer. “Volumes are not bad,” so far in late 2020, he said, which he expects will continue to be the case in 2021. “There’s a lot of options, and maybe some pent-up demand,” said Clutterbuck, adding the pandemic has had its obvious negative impacts but that it will continue to be business as usual as much as it can be in 2021. “I’m anticipating an improvement from a local standpoint. It really hasn’t manifested itself in great ways that I can see,” said Clutterbuck of the pandemic. He hopes vaccinations being administered on a large scale by mid-year will bring the industry back as close to normal as possible. Valbruna ASW Inc. is also hoping to expand its workforce by about 15 per cent in the coming year. That’s the result of a new electric arc furnace that will be installed in the summer, an integral piece of equipment in the plant’s operations. He expects industry will be affected by COVID-19 for at least the next six to eight months. A discussion about “reshoring” — creating supply chains on home turf — is being had within the industrial sector across Canada, said Niagara Industrial Association board chair Don Cyr. Manufacturers in Niagara, especially with personal protective equipment, could use this to their advantage.

Gagnon said a $5,000 government grant the company received will help with the brewery’s online marketing. Business Government help on tap for Brimstone Brewing Co. RH By Richard HuttonReporter Mon., Jan. 4, 2021timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jan. 21, 2021 It goes without saying that 2020 was a challenging year for local businesses, whether it be restaurant, retail store or — in the case of one local business — craft breweries. It’s all thanks to what was, at one time, a mystery virus that began to spread in Wuhan, China, as 2019 wound down. The results have been lockdowns, public health restrictions and in many cases, businesses shutting their doors for good. So, when government assistance is offered, it is welcome, said Jason Pizzicarola, owner of Brimstone Brewing Co. in Ridgeway. “The government has been pretty good that way,” Pizzicarola said of various forms of assistance businesses have received since March, when the country went into its first lockdown. That assistance included such programs as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, as well as a menu of grants available through the provincial government. Most recently, Brimstone was approved for a grant of $5,000 from a joint program of the provincial and federal governments to help businesses in the agrifood sector with marketing efforts. Pizzicarola said it will help Brimstone in its efforts to raise the profile of the craft brewery’s products, such as its signature Sinister Minister IPA, Punk Rock Pilsner or Enlightenment Blonde Ale, among others. “It will definitely help put some of the fuel back in the tank,” he said. The cash will be used to enhance Brimstone’s web store and marketing in order to raise awareness of the brewery’s products and hopefully, generate enough sales to see the company through the current crisis. That’s something brewmaster Zack Gagnon agrees with. “Marketing plays a huge role,” he said. “It helps is get our name out there.” And with the current lockdown, online sales are going to become even more important so the extra dollars will be counted on to help. “More and more people are now shopping with their eyes,” Gagnon said. “Anything like that (the government grant) will help.” The $5,000 received by Brimstone was part of a $3.5-million investment by the two levels of government designed to assist businesses in the agrifood sector. Dubbed the Open for E-business initiative, it is meant to allow smaller businesses and opportunity to establish or enhance their online shopping presence. Getting more businesses into the e-commerce world would mean a greater number of options for consumers when they shop online.

Restaurants Diverse selection: Put your ‘Trust’ in this new St. Catharines beer bar SS By Satbir SinghNiagara This Week Mon., July 20, 2020timer2 min. read With nearly 100 beer options on the menu, Trust Beer Bar is hoping to create a relaxing atmosphere that pairs well with many of the other new businesses in downtown St. Catharines. Owner Erik Dickson is going for a more casual approach with the place, which opened June 12 at 3 Garden Park. “I think we’re pretty complementary to everything else that’s new downtown,” Dickson said. “Go to a restaurant, have a really good dinner, then come here and have some drinks.” Dickson also operates Warehouse Concert Hall — only a six-minute walk from his new bar — and explained Trust Beer Bar isn’t a restaurant and it won’t have any live music like his other venture. “This business is specifically looking at the idea of being able to go out with friends and get a drink without listening to a band or DJ,” he said. It’s the perfect location before or after a show — once government restrictions allow concerts and other entertainment venues to reopen. Trust Beer Bar was planning to open during last fall before construction progress was delayed, and then a late-March opening was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bar offers about 100 beer products from local breweries in Niagara and across Ontario, and some European breweries and from other parts of Canada as well. “Our selection is pretty diverse, and the goal is to obviously target the average consumer who just wants to have a drink with friends, but also the beer enthusiast,” Dickson said. “We have a pretty knowledgeable staff here who can help guide people through the decision-making process of ordering from a beer list that has 100 things on it.” Many of the beer products come in bottles or cans with a select number of draft options. One thing that is for sure, many of the products can’t be found at the LCBO. “In many cases you would actually have to travel to the breweries themselves in order to get some of these products, so part of the advantage we’re looking at is to be able to provide access to those products to people who might not have the capacity to travel to those breweries,” Dickson said. Food options are limited to tacos, but Dickson said that’s because he wants to keep food items simple. With Trust Beer Bar being less of a restaurant, the food offered is inexpensive, and the options are more of a snack that you can have with drinks. Types of tacos offered are classic pork, pineapple chicken, garlic pork, smoky chicken and pulled mushroom — all gluten free. Dickson highlighted that the beer menu has a high number of IPA and sour beer categories. With an interest in craft beer, Dickson hopes his bar will provide St. Catharines an opportunity to get a taste of the options not available at the LCBO and due to the distance of some of the breweries. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “For me it was a big thing personally being interested in the products and wanting to help make those products available to people here.” Trust Beer Bar patio is open with a mist fan to help customers keep cool, and no reservations are needed.

For starters, she likes working with the cheddars of the world. She artfully slices and displays them alongside salami and its cured meat brethren to make charcuterie, those meat and cheese platters that have been de rigueur since the 1400s in France. She likes it so much she decided to pin a business plan on filling boxes and boards with the stuff to create what she calls “adult Lunchables,” a grown-up spin on those grocery store lunch kits marketed to busy parents needing a quick fix for their kids’ midday meals. And she does it under the vowel-eschewing moniker CHZ PLZ, which elicited so many giggles when she told people about it that she knew she was onto something. “Everyone laughed at me. They thought it was so silly,” Hartley said about people’s reactions to her business name. “It’s just a little cheesy part of me.” Nearly two years after launching CHZ PLZ, however, the person smiling most is Hartley. That’s because those who giggled initially are too busy filling their mouths with spreads made by a woman with the tenacity of a hunk of ripe Limburger. Turn the clock back just a few years, and Hartley, who moved here from Owen Sound, was a culinary student at Niagara College. To pay for full-time studies, she worked full-time hours, starting with washing dishes at the Lake House Restaurant in Vineland. Hartley worked her way up the ranks in a few years. She was sous-chef when she gave her two months’ notice to strike out on her own in 2018. While she was done with the gruelling 15-hour days so often demanded in professional kitchens, she wasn’t finished with one job that was part of her duties at the busy dining room sandwiched between the QEW and Lake Ontario shoreline. Hartley was assigned to assemble charcuterie boards. Though the art of charcuterie, which literally translates to cooked flesh, is centuries old, there’s been renewed interest in the fancy deli platters by chefs and diners alike in the past decade. People love charcuterie because it’s shareable. That makes it the perfect nibble over which to socialize. It’s also incredibly photogenic, making charcuterie easy to share on social media, too. Hartley, who’s also a painter, loved the creative freedom inspired by slices of prosciutto, wedges of brie, and the splashes of colour offered by preserves. “As long as you had the ingredients that were on the list, you could design it however you wanted,” she recalled. Eventually it became the muse for Hartley’s own business plan, offering something that long hours in the kitchen seemed to stifle. “Any of your emotions, you could put it in the board, every time. However you were feeling, you could just do it that way,” Hartley said. “That’s kind of the opposite of this industry. A lot of higher-end (cooking), it’s following this recipe and having these exacting standards. But with a (charcuterie) box today, it’s not going to look like a box tomorrow, even if it has all the same things.” Hartley also really loves eating charcuterie. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “You can have a bunch of everything and that’s why I like it. It’s the perfect little nibble. I love it because you don’t have to commit to one thing.” Still, she did commit to one thing with her business. Hartley launched CHZ PLZ in May 2018, borrowing kitchen space to fill charcuterie orders before she was approached by Lock Street Brewing Co. owner Wolfgang Guembel to take over the tiny galley in the Port Dalhousie brewery. Hartley had 50 cents in her bank account at the time. As her balance inched toward the red, she signed a lease in late 2019 and opened in February this year, weeks before a global pandemic would take the allure out of shareable food. She adjusted. Hartley and CHZ PLZ started offering charcuterie to go in mini boxes perfect for eating alone in a lockdown. She even does vegan versions with nut cheeses and meats made from alternative proteins.

Orders for her edible art are brisk. That keeps her thinking about how to keep charcuterie interesting, and being ready for the next pivot, whether it’s making her own cheeses — she makes her own preserves — or something else entirely. As for her beef with vowels, it’s nothing personal against the AEIOU crowd and their sometimes sidekick, Y. Her reason for leaving them out of the CHZ PLZ name, causing some to add them back in anyway or call it giggle-inducing Chez Plez, isn’t cheesy at all. It’s more a reflection of how she felt as a mid-twenty-something female chef forging out on her own in a tough industry. “I felt powerful when trying to create a name,” Hartley said. “It’s capital letters. I just needed something strong. Everybody, when they look at the name and logo, it’s strong and powerful and that represented myself. “Nothing against vowels.” TM Tiffany Mayer blogs about food and farming at timeforgrub.com. twitter.com/eatingniagara SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Life Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Niagara Region Labour shortage may be a result of the pandemic, says chair of Niagara Industrial Association’s board By Dave JohnsonTribune Reporter Kris DubeThe Welland Tribune Sun., Jan. 10, 2021timer2 min. read Production was down by over 35 per cent at Valbruna ASW Inc. in the first half of 2020, a hit brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused reduced hours and less demand from international customers, said president Tim Clutterbuck. The more than 100 employees that work at the century-old steel factory in Welland didn’t suffer layoffs that kept them home for full weeks but did slice some shifts from their paycheques. The government’s wage subsidy program was a major factor in keeping people working, said Clutterbuck. Things are “more normal” now and production has increased in the second half of 2020, he said, operating an essential service. The steel manufacturer, founded in 1918 and known as Atlas Steel for many years, was bracing for COVID-19 before the shutdown arrived. They were “not certain what it would mean for business” at the time, he said. Keeping everyone safe, physically and mentally, has been a priority for the company, he said, especially screening and keeping distance from drivers who were coming from the U.S. The border has “not been a problem,” said Clutterbuck, adding that it being open for commerce has not impacted his industry. Don Cyr, chair of Niagara Industrial Association’s board, said there were some “anecdotal” supply chain issues for his group’s 260 members, most of them small and medium-sized manufacturers. This occurred “early on in the pandemic,” but things have “straightened out” since then, said Cyr, who is also a professor of finance at Brock University. A bit of a labour shortage may be a result of the pandemic, he said. “That’s systemic of trades overall, perhaps exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Cyr. For companies who trade with the U.S., having staff who travelled there and being required to quarantine for 14 days was a challenge. Cyr also said border restrictions have not been a major issue with the flow of products. “Goods have moved back and forth quite efficiently there,” said Cyr. Some companies have taken advantage of the new realities the pandemic has brought on. Barbican, a company in Fort Erie that makes architectural supplies, has started developing personal protective equipment — one of a few local factories taking this route. Barbican is creating “innovative shields” for desks to be used on school desks, said Cyr. Local industry has “kept moving,” he said.

Restaurants in downtown Welland switched to take-out and delivery service at the start of the pandemic. Business Retail and hospitality industries hit hard by COVID-19 in 2020, says chamber executive director By Dave Johnson, Kris Dube, The Well and Tribune Mon., Jan. 11, 2021timer3 min. read It’s been a tough go for businesses across south Niagara since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, says South Niagara Chambers of Commerce executive director Dolores Fabiano. “There have been some causalities and some are just hanging on right now. The sectors being affected are retail and hospitality across the board,” said Fabiano, who heads up Welland/Pelham, Port Colborne/Wainfleet, Fort Erie and Niagara Falls chambers of commerce. She said some businesses are focused on “staying open for today” and what they need to do to survive as restrictions change provincially to stop the spread of COVID-19. On Boxing Day, Niagara entered into a month-long lockdown closing all but essential services. “If they don’t focus on tomorrow, they might not get a chance to be here tomorrow,” she said. Fabiano said Niagara residents can help local businesses weather the pandemic by shopping local. “It’s never been more important than right now. These people are our neighbours, our friends, they employ people we know.” She said people can buy gift certificates from shops and restaurants or get takeout orders from restaurants to help small businesses survive. Welland Mayor Frank Campion said the Rose City is doing everything it can to assist and support local business and encourage the community to support them as well. “The restrictions also negatively impact local businesses particularly retail and the service industries like restaurants which in turn results in some job losses and layoffs,” said Campion, adding the city has several employers who provide essential services and are less affected. In the Rose City, two popular stores at Seaway Mall closed before COVID-19 shut down the province in March. Carlton Cards and Things Engraved closed, and in the summer, Cleo-Ricki and Bootlegger declared bankruptcy and closed its Welland store. To make things worse, in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations being the subject of a lawsuit focused on Nygard Brands founder Peter Nygard, closures of Nygard Plus, and Alia N’ Tanjay hit the mall in the summer. The mall has bounced back and filled many of these units, said mall president Mike Belcastro. But that was the toughest time for the mall in north Welland. “That hurt a lot,” he said. “We lost a bunch of stores all at once,” added Belcastro. During the Christmas shopping season, traffic was irregular and sporadic, not consistently busy like it usually is this time of year. “It’s not the norm at Christmas when everyone is here at once,” he said Dec. 15. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... He did not have exact numbers, but said things are “down a bit,” but not as bad as we anticipated.” North Welland BIA chair John Clark said small businesses have suffered in 2020. “They’re extremely stressed out,” said Clark, who also owns MT Bellies on Niagara Street, a restaurant that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. People in hospitality and retail have not been able to get comfortable with one set of rules — knowing things are about to change in a week, or the next day. “We have to pivot, reorganize, re-strategize all the time,” said Clark. Small business owners have had to “play with the cards” they’ve been given, and “celebrate the small victories when they happen,” said Clark. Wainfleet Mayor Kevin Gibson said unemployment did not seem to bubble to the surface in any chats he had with township businesses. “Farmers, of course, work a lot by themselves so they just continued doing their everyday work. I did not hear of any businesses laying off people due to COVID. Having said that I am sure there must have been some, but overall the impact was less than a bigger city,” said Gibson. Port Colborne Mayor Bill Steele said economic development staff continued efforts to assist businesses with maintaining their day-to-day operations and marketing the community to consumers within the city and beyond. “One successful initiative was securing a sizeable grant from the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO) to assist with COVID recovery,” said Steele The city also set up pickup-only designated parking spaces in the downtown core to help businesses.

A group of Walker Industries employees organized a walk at the park. Crime Welland sexual assault victim speaks during Elimination of Violence Against Women event By Dave JohnsonTribune Reporter Thu., Nov. 26, 2020timer2 min. read The victim of a sexual assault in Welland used a walk on International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to speak about what happened to her this past September. The walk was organized by environmental division employees at Walker Industries and held at Oakes Park in Niagara Falls, said Stephanie Turton. Turton, an operations assistant in Walker’s environmental division, said she knew of the woman who had been sexually assaulted by a man while she was jogging on the Steve Bauer Trail on Prince Charles Drive on Sept. 17. “We wanted to do something to make a positive impact in the community,” said Turton of Wednesday’s walk. She said the 45-year-old woman reached out to her when a second rally was held in support of her along the trail near Prince Charles Drive and Thorold Road. That rally saw 100 people come out. “She knew we (Walker Industries) were planning a walk and wanted to speak to our group. I believe she was empowered by the community helping her to cope and heal with what happened.” Before the walk, which also saw Walker employees in Halifax and others take part remotely, the woman spoke. “A couple months ago, I was the victim of a senseless and violent attack while out running. Thankfully, I was able to fight back, and in that moment, I became a survivor. Every day since the attack, I have been fighting a personal battle to find the strength that will allow me to heal my physical injuries and emotional wounds. “It hasn’t been easy, but I will not allow my attacker to break my spirit. I am strong, brave and even more determined to bring about change in our world today. I will fight for myself, for all women, and for a world where women and girls can live free of fear, violence and insecurity. I stand here today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, with a clear message: Violence against women and girls must end,” the woman told those at the walk. Turton said in the group of 10 at Oakes Park, at least four knew someone who has been the victim of violence. “You’d be hard-pressed not to find someone affected by gender-based violence. It’s important to talk about it. It’s often hushed up and it doesn’t have to be. We need to have these conversations so victims can heal and we can get to the root of the problem.” Wednesday also marked the beginning of the annual global 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign that runs until Dec. 10.

It’s not a fashion statement per se so much as a communitywide show of solidarity against domestic violence that, sadly, has seen a big jump since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Niagara in March. November is Woman Abuse Prevention Month, and Women’s Place of South Niagara has joined shelters across Ontario in the eighth annual Wrapped in Courage campaign. Typically, Women’s Place — it operates the Nova House shelter in Niagara Falls and the Serenity House shelter in Welland — sells the symbolic purple scarves or purple ties this time of year to raise funds to support the costs of operating the shelters. But because of efforts to control the virus, Women’s Place won’t be selling scarves or ties, said executive director Jennifer Gauthier. However, the need for financial support at Women’s Place is as great as it’s ever been, she said. Even during a normal year, Women’s Place needs to raise about $500,000 just to keep the lights on. But COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of major fundraisers for the agency such as the annual Book Riot that was scheduled for June and which last year raised about $72,000. “The need for our services has never been greater, given the risk to women and children,” said Gauthier. The isolation, job losses, financial pressure, the inability of family members to take breaks from each other and increasing alcohol consumption has added tension to households that may already have been troubled, said Gauthier. That, in turn, has sparked a noticeable increase in both the number of cases of domestic abuse and in the severity of the violence, she said. In September, Statistics Canada reported that in the first four months of the pandemic, police services representing 59 per cent of the country’s population reported a 12 per cent increase in domestic disturbances compared to last year. Complicating matters even more is many women who normally might have had at least some kind of support network at work are now stuck at home. “That’s one of our main concerns,” said Gauthier. “The disconnectedness of women now isolating in their homes without access to social supports. They’re not getting a reprieve from the violence.” She stressed women experiencing abuse can reach out to Women’s Place via its emergency crisis lines, which have people answering calls or receiving texts 24 hours a day, at 905-788-0113 or 905-356-5800. Despite purple scarves not being sold this year, Gauthier said people wearing them will show women suffering abuse that they’re not alone. “I think it’s important that we all stand together and say violence against women and children is not OK,” she said. By donating directly to Women’s Place via its website or to the Wrapped in Courage campaign — through which donations will be shared among shelters — people can help ensure the local shelters can continue to keep women and children safe, said Gauthier. People can text the word “courage” to 41010 to donate $5 to $25. “Right now, most shelters in Ontario can’t cover their basic operating costs without turning to fundraising and are in urgent need of your support,” said Gauthier. “The need has reached critical proportions.” On Nov. 25, the International Day of the Elimination of Violence Against Women, people can also show their support by tying a purple scarf somewhere people can see it then posting a photo on social media with the hashtag #wrappedincourage or using the tag @wrappedincourage.

Niagara Regional Police visited the home, in the area of Cozy and Duncan streets, on a weekday before lunch — regular business hours during which city bylaw officers are designated as the party to handle such complaints. Instead, police responded after it was determined there was a “safety concern” at the address, said NRP spokesman Const. Phil Gavin on Wednesday. He would not elaborate on what risks or dangers were possibly present at the home, where four women and four men of various ages were penalized. Gavin said police were “asked” to attend the scene, adding it was not the local municipality that made the request. Asked why police responded to the incident, and not local bylaw staff, Welland interim CAO Steve Zorbas declined comment. Officers arrived on scene and observed multiple people inside a residence, “clearly in contradiction of the COVID-19 regulations,” NRP said in a statement. Four men ages 28, 33, 34 and 52 and four women ages 30, 32, 38 and 44 were fined under the Reopening Ontario Act. Police say because the eight are not facing criminal charges, their names are not being released. Gavin said he expects these aren’t the last fines that will be handed out in Niagara, after the province issued a stay-at-home order and tightened lockdown conditions earlier this week. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Eight people fined $880 each under COVID rules for indoor gathering in Welland Jan. 12, 2021 “We would we like to see voluntary compliance with the provincial legislation and guidelines, particularly with the increase in number of cases. If this happens, then there is no need for enforcement,” said Gavin. “That being said, our officers have been provided with, and are kept up to the changes, as it pertains to the enforceable guidelines.” Further enforcement of the COVID-19 guidelines under the act is a “likely reality,” Gavin said.

The previous gathering limit outside — set at 10 individuals, starting Boxing Day — will be trimmed by half as new restrictions take effect Thursday. This week, the Ontario government said all provincial offences officers, including police officers, will have the authority to disperse crowds indoors as well as outdoors. “For example, when a group of more than five people who are not from the same household are gathering outdoors, they can be required to leave and the premise may be closed,” it said. On Tuesday, Toronto Mayor John Tory expressed concerns over confusion about skating rinks and tobogganing hills, asking for specific details on how parks and hills should operate under the new rules. What requires clarification, Tory said, is a provincial guideline stating: “No person is permitted to use an indoor or outdoor recreational amenity that is required to be closed.” Tory noted the city of Toronto has more than 50 outdoor skating rinks that are open. On Tuesday, Welland’s interim director of development and building services Grant Munday said local skating rinks would no longer be allowing hockey, in an effort to curb large gatherings and people not physically distancing. Skating rinks and tobogganing hills have not been ordered to close by the province and can remain open, with restrictions. The city issued a news release Wednesday on hockey being banned on municipally operated skating surfaces. However, senior staff at Welland city hall did not answer specific questions on how the hockey ban will be enforced. People at outdoor skating surfaces are asked to exercise caution before skating as ice may not be fully formed and thin in areas, the city cautioned in the release. “Visitors are also asked to wear a mask or face covering, leave any non-essential personal belongings at home and ensure physical distancing is maintained while on the ice surfaces or taking part in other outdoor activities such as walking, cross country skiing and tobogganing,” the city said. As part of the COVID-19 lockdown measures, outdoor recreational amenities are open with restrictions. No team sports such as hockey are to be played or practiced, the city reiterated. The Ontario government also said provincial offences officers have the authority to temporarily close a premise and disperse individuals who are in contravention of gathering limits in the order. This can be done “regardless whether a premise has been closed or remains open, such as a park,” the province said. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Welland bans hockey at outdoor public skating surfaces Jan. 12, 2021 In another news release Wednesday, the city said the Jack Bellantyne youth arena will be closed for the remainder of the 2020-21 season.

Niagara Region Welland bans hockey at outdoor public skating surfaces By Kris DubéTribune Reporter Tue., Jan. 12, 2021timer2 min. read Complaints received over the weekend about large gatherings have resulted in the City of Welland implementing a ban on hockey at its outdoor skating surfaces. There were reports of groups at Chippawa Park’s large pond, as well as at Woodlawn Park, where a trail that winds through a forest regularly draws skaters. Lacing up and going for a few strides is permitted, but dropping a puck and nets on the ice is no longer allowed, said Grant Munday, the city’s interim director of development and building services. “It’s an unfortunate measure we have to take but we’re trying to balance this virus with the need for people to get outdoor activity,” said Munday, the municipality’s manager of development approvals who has taken on his temporary role as a result of changes at city hall. Later Tuesday, new restrictions were put into effect by the province, which declared an emergency order. “Outdoor organized public gatherings and social gatherings are further restricted to a limit of five people with limited exceptions,” the province said. “This is consistent with the rules during the lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 in spring 2020 and will allow individuals and families to enjoy time outdoors safely,” the government said. Munday said there “were some concerns about people congregating on the ice,” referring to activity on the weekend. Complaints about groups and scrimmage hockey games during business hours should be directed to the city, and after-hours reports should be directed to Niagara Regional Police, said Munday. Const. Jesse Vujasic said police responded to Chippawa Park on Sunday, but no fines were assessed. “There were no large groups, just parties making use of the pond and everyone was practising safe distancing,” she said. “We have not received any further calls in regard to members of the public not following COVID-19 restrictions while tobogganing or skating outdoors.” She said the NRP will be adding outdoor rinks to patrol routes and investigate complaints as they come in. Asked about bleachers that sit at Woodlawn Park serving as a gathering spot, Munday said “that’s something we will have to look at,” pointing out that they are meant to be a place for people to lace up and take off skates. Tobogganing is permitted under the provincial lockdown. Munday said if more snow falls and people congregate at local hills, it will be another area to monitor. Mason Saxton and his friend Spencer Brown, both Grade 9 students at Centennial Secondary School, were taking a break from online learning Tuesday afternoon by going for a skate, hockey sticks in hand, at Chippawa Park. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Three outdoor community ice rinks waiting for freeze in St. Catharines Jan. 11, 2021 Told the city is putting a ban on hockey at outdoor public spaces, Saxton said it will be tough for people his age to deal with. “I understand they don’t want a group of people, but we already have so little to do and this is one of the spots we can come to enjoy themselves,” said the 14-year-old.

There are 44 parishes in the region, and more than 40 will be allowing physical attendance, said Margaret Jong, vice-chancellor of the Diocese of St. Catharines., adding that she is unsure of an exact number. Up to 60 per cent are providing virtual services. The 10-person maximum applies to weddings, funerals and other religious services, rites or ceremonies where “physical distancing can be maintained and in compliance with rules on face coverings,” says the provincial government. Drive-in services, rites or ceremonies are permitted, subject to certain conditions, the province says. Churches are also permitted to host outdoor services with a maximum of 10 people in attendance. With the Dec. 26 lockdown, Bishop Gerard Bergie gave pastors “the responsibility to determine if they were able to keep their parish churches open to the public safely, ensuring that all mandated COVID protocols were followed,” said Jong, referring to capacity limits, face coverings, sanitizing, disinfecting, and contact tracing. A number of parishes started livestreaming masses and other liturgical services in March 2020, and more are doing so now, said Jong. Participating in livestreamed services has become an important way for parishioners to “maintain connection with their faith community and receive spiritual nourishment,” she said. “However, virtual attendance has obvious limitations, and the inability to receive Holy Communion and to gather together in person is a tremendous sacrifice for Catholics,” she added. Niagara’s Anglican churches are taking a cautious approach, holding only online services, and allowing no more than five people inside to play roles in virtual broadcasts, says The Right Reverend Susan Bell, Bishop for the Niagara diocese. “We’re curtailing the number even further than what we’re technically allowed,” she said Thursday referring to the limit of 10. “We’re all aware that the numbers are higher than they were in the first wave of the pandemic,” she added. All 90 parishes in the region were closed to members on Dec. 22. “We definitely don’t want to, in any way, contribute to more infections,” she said. During the timeframe last year when churches were allowed to be filled at 30 per cent capacity, Anglican places of worship in Niagara kept a limit of 50 people. Some of the buildings are “very large” and 30 per cent capacity would equate to “hundreds of people,” said Bell. The majority of Congregation B’Nai Israel’s membership is elderly, the main reason the Jewish synagogue in St. Catharines has chosen to only hold virtual services since last March. “We have to use further caution with congregating,” said the place of worship’s office administrator Serge Chiriqui on Thursday. “It’s just not worth the risk,” he added. Twice a month, services have been livestreamed and enjoyed by between 25 and 50 people each time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “The online programming has worked out wonderfully,” he said. Before the pandemic started last year, the synagogue welcomed up to 80 people on Saturday services, said Chiriqui. The Islamic Society of Niagara Peninsula, based in Niagara Falls, also isn’t taking any risks. Its board decided it was “prudent to shut down services” for the next 28 days starting Dec. 26 “for the safety of our entire community including elderly and children,” says their website. Martha Lockwood, pastor at Central United Church in downtown Welland, said her church allowing 10 people inside wouldn’t make sense. Lockwood can be found online weekly offering services, but she’s also joined by a technical assistant, a music co-ordinator, and someone who leads singing. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Wellandport church considering charter challenge against province over COVID-19 restrictions Dec. 14, 2020 This leaves room for only six people to attend. “It’s hardly worth it,” she said, noting that everyone involved in the production are more than six metres apart. About 40 people attended weekly services between last September and the weekend before Christmas, but the church is strictly operating online now. When people were there physically, singing was discouraged. “When you sing, your droplets go a lot further than when you’re speaking,” she said, adding that she suspects some people sang under their masks. People were encouraged to “hum,” she said. Lockwood also takes exception to churches who are “defying” the provincial rules, pointing to one in the Waterloo area which has been doing so, she said. “I think it’s irresponsible and reckless to put your parishioners’ lives in danger,” she said.

According to their own website COVID-19 vaccines for Ontario it says only 144,784 doses were administered since the beginning of the program in December and 11,231 doses on Tuesday, Jan. 12. At this rate it will take years before the entire population is given their two shots. To me it indicates there is something very wrong with the whole process of acquisition and distribution of the vaccine. We need the government to be frank and transparent with us so that we can gain some understanding of what is actually happening at all levels. We are in a very real crisis and the government is eroding our confidence by patently over estimating its ability to cope, promising it is fully in control and everything is going to be just fine if we are patient. I urge every one to access the web site daily and let their representatives know what they think of their progress. Chris Manning St. Catharines Local politicians’ second wave plan a head-scratcher Re: Niagara leaders draft plan to deal with second wave of COVID-19, Jan. 9 This initiative is yet another example of local politicians working in silos. The Region of Niagara has been around since 1970 and the pandemic has been here for the last nine to 10 months and municipal leaders in Niagara are just coming together now to develop some common principles. This is a real head scratcher. Whether it be the garbage debate with Niagara Falls threatening to take the Region to court; COVID-19 mask policy; COVID-19 beach policy; or COVID-19 arena policy; politicians in Niagara have demonstrated time and time again their inability to work together for a better Niagara and continue to work in silos at the detriment to Niagara taxpayers. Having 139 political positions, more than any other municipality in Ontario, is definitely a challenge when it comes to getting any work done and moving Niagara forward. In addition, Niagara offers numerous duplicate services such as 13 different CAO positions for upper and lower tier governments; 12 separate fire services; numerous transit services, planning departments, finance departments, HR departments, economic development officers and the list goes on and on. Niagara politicians have demonstrated they do not have the capacity to work together for a better Niagara; it’s time for the province to step in and make the changes needed. Al McKay St. Catharines Retired nurse willing to help with vaccines Re: Let’s get the vaccinations started, Letters, Jan. 9 I am also a retired nurse and agree that the vaccinations should be done as soon as possible, in clinics 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

Re: Departed St. Joe’s CEO to get $1 million payout after losing job following Caribbean vacation, Jan. 11 I am writing about the recent spate of incidents revealing that our politicians and officials, federal, provincial and, for all we know, local, have adopted a “Do as we say not as we do” approach to travel abroad. Almost as outrageous as the travel (usually to warmer luxury resorts) are the lame excuses once they are confronted by the press. I am reminded of an episode of the TV series “Seinfeld” in which George Costanza is caught in a compromising position under his desk with the cleaning lady. Caught red-handed, so to speak, he asked, “Why? Is that frowned upon? Is there some sort of company policy against it?” This latest bozo outbreak just reinforces my belief that once some politicians get elected, they discover that all they have to do is dutifully obey the party line and vote like robots. They then can enjoy all the perks. True believers only are elevated to higher positions, such as cabinet. To add salt to our wounds, their leaders who control them always claim outrage, play dumb, and deny any knowledge of their trips, showing they are either negligent or they are lying. What is it about the words “global pandemic, hundreds of thousands dead” that these self-important, so called “servants of the people” do not understand? Richard Murri Niagara Falls Angry, impatient drivers ought to take another road test I am writing to warn pedestrians about impatient drivers who seem to forget that we have the right of way, not them! More than once I and my husband have been almost run down by drivers who don’t bother to look both ways at stop signs or drive right through a red light just when we were crossing (and yes the light had been red for a while!). Then there are the drivers who curse at us for crossing properly at the light when it is saying “Walk,” yelling at us that this was not a cross walk. Drivers honk and curse even when it is not their turn to go, they are that impatient! Perhaps it’s time for drivers to retake their driving test as a reminder. What do other readers think? Annette Lawrence Niagara Falls Paramedics should be near the front of the vaccination line Re: 34 Niagara paramedics in isolation as COVID-19 cases increase, Dec. 29 It would seem our government officials think that COVID-19 patients walk to the hospital. Paramedics, using minimal PPE, often doing life-saving methods on the COVID patient, and dealing with others in their household who also could have COVID, seem to be under appreciated and not deemed as an essential service. Saying they will be vaccinated near the end of the first phase of the vaccination rollout is unacceptable. Niagara has 34 paramedics quarantined currently. Why isn’t the public up in arms about this? They would be if anyone in their family needed to rely on these forgotten front-line workers. You cannot get any more front line if you tried.

Re: Canada is not immune to Capitol Hill riots, Jan. 12 It is clear from recent news there were Canadians among the rabble that stormed the U.S. Capitol. This is something we as a nation should be deeply ashamed of. It should also be treated with potential penalties, even if these are as little as being barred from re-entry to Canada until they have proof of being COVID-19 free, and then still have to do supervised quarantine when home. Canada Border Services Agency officers, I hope, will question such Canadians returning from whatever false mission they cite, with much more close scrutiny since these people will not be able to describe their travel as being “essential.” Kaspar Pold Niagara-on-the-Lake Harris undeserving of provincial honour Keith Leslie in his article Jan. 6 refers to some citizens being “riled” by the idea Mike Harris could receive the Order of Ontario. It goes beyond riled; it makes us disgusted and sick. The intensity of these feelings is not simply reacting to his politics. His actions had far-reaching suffering that many are enduring to this day. The families of citizens of Walkerton who were killed by polluted water will never get their loved ones back. The inquiry blamed budgetary cuts from the Harris government that destroyed checks and balances involved in testing municipal water. Teachers will never forget what he did. Upon election he appointed a high-school dropout as education minister who bragged he would “create a crisis” in education — he did. The vast majority of teachers had never been involved in disruptions, but the Harris government managed to cause every teacher in Ontario walk out, with 20,000 of them gathering outside Queen’s Park to protest. One of his ugliest insults was to justify health cuts with the declaration nurses were becoming as obsolete as people who make hula hoops. The Indigenous people of Ontario haven’t forgotten Harris’s expletive-laden slur against them during their occupation of Ontario’s Ipperwash Provincial Park. If the Order of Ontario is bestowed upon Mke Harris, I think we’ll see many of those who hold this honour decide it’s worthless and perhaps even return it. David Fowler Wainfleet Outcomes could have been different Re: 2020 a year of misinformation, muddled messages, infections, Jan. 3 I was one of the hydro executives proposing a local solution to combat the pandemic. My only regret is we did not push more and continue to promote this after we were stonewalled by provincial authorities. Our focus was on the need for more testing and tracing. As we presented to regional council in April, our concern was cases would increase again in September (they did) and without extensive testing and tracing capabilities which would allow for more targeted actions, authorities would be forced again to rely on broad and drastic measures like lockdown.

At their Tuesday meeting, city councillors will receive a letter from the doctors as information and support it. The doctors are also calling for the province to provide more vaccines to protect long-term-care homes and front-line health-care workers in Niagara. A recommendation to receive and support the letter also urges the provincial government to immediately allocate more Pfizer vaccines to Niagara “and restore the allocation of Moderna unfairly taken away.” It also asks that Mayor Frank Campion be authorized to send a letter to Premier Doug Ford on behalf of Welland city council. It calls for the motion to go to all local area municipalities, all members of the provincial legislature and Niagara Health’s medical advisory committee — made up of the hospital system’s leading physicians.

It doesn’t even have to be a mystery. Both Niagara West MPP Sam Oosterhoff and a spokesman for the Ontario Ministry of Health were asked about it earlier this week. A simple answer from either would have clarified the matter. To recap: The issue came to light this week when top physicians at Niagara Health released an open letter — a plea to the province for more help, really — stating Niagara was being treated unfairly regarding COVID care. In it, among other things, they said they were disheartened when a shipment of the Moderna vaccine that should have been sent to Niagara was redirected somewhere else. If the Moderna vaccine — which would have complemented the Pfizer vaccine — was diverted to another region in greater need, tell us. We wouldn’t like it, but we appreciate being treated with honesty. If, on the other hand, the doctors are wrong when they say a Moderna vaccine shipment bound for Niagara was “unfairly taken away” and sent to another part of Ontario, then Oosterhoff and the ministry rep should have cleared the air. Instead, health ministry spokesman David Jensen and Oosterhoff did a sort of dance of diversion. Asked about the Moderna shipment, Jensen’s emailed reply stated: “Niagara has received shipments of the vaccine, with more shipments expected each week thereafter.” Presumably he is referring to the Pfizer vaccine, which arrived Tuesday. But he was asked about Moderna, which was due to arrive at the same time. Jensen didn’t reply to follow-up questions. As has become his habit, Oosterhoff declined to be interviewed. Instead, the government MPP emailed a statement saying he was glad to see Niagara had received vaccine doses and would get more in the coming weeks. This is an important issue, and Niagara residents deserve an explanation. In their letter, Niagara Health doctors laid out all Niagara has had to deal with regarding COVID-19 and the alarming growth of the coronavirus in the community, moreso in our long-term care and retirement homes. While they were glad to receive the Pfizer vaccine, they said, “it’s not enough.” Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Not with the virus sickening so many people, killing too many, and overwhelming hospitals and frontline health-care providers across the region. “This is compounded by the inexplicable diversion of the Moderna vaccine, which would have gone to the most vulnerable population that we care for in Niagara,” the doctors wrote. This week, we learned Niagara ranks fourth among regions across Ontario for COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. We topped Toronto. As of Friday, there were outbreaks at 26 long-term care homes and retirement homes here. At one point we had an entire hospital in outbreak. RELATED STORIES Editorial Donald Trump must face a final reckoning Jan. 15, 2021 Editorial Based on new lockdown measures, Doug Ford isn’t getting it Jan. 14, 2021 Editorial Vaccines are coming but it’s not time to relax COVID vigilance Jan. 12, 2021 As the doctors pointed out, there are 32 long-term care homes in Niagara. Most are either in outbreak or have been and were cleared. Places with fewer long-term care sites, such as Windsor with 19 and York Region with 28, have seen residents of their facilities already vaccinated. Why the delay in Niagara? About 21 per cent of our population is comprised of people 65 and older; the provincial average is closer to 16 per cent. Having so many seniors means we have a lot of long-term care homes. That means we have more staff and other service providers going in and out of those locations than other regions. So our potential for virus spread is worse. And yet, we weren’t able to start vaccinations until Tuesday. That’s why a straight answer from Oosterhoff or the ministry spokesman would have been appreciated. We’re tired of playing games.

At the same time, a cadre of local politicians lined up behind a group of senior Niagara Health doctors calling on the province to provide more vaccines to protect local long-term care homes and front line health care workers, and reinstate the shipment. On Wednesday, Niagara Health’s medical advisory committee — which is comprised of the hospital system’s leading physicians — issued an open letter to community leaders, asking for support in calling for more help from the provincial government. The letter also asks Queen’s Park to “restore the allocation of the Moderna vaccine that was unfairly taken away.” Niagara’s acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, says Niagara was set to receive shipments of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines this week. But last week, without explanation, the provincial government redirected the Moderna shipment to another community. Vaccine supplies are currently limited, and are being used to protect long-term care residents and frontline health care workers, particularly in those regions with high rates of transmission. While Niagara’s infection rate was comparatively low in December when vaccines first became available, the local situation has rapidly deteriorated. Niagara now has a higher incidence of COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people than Toronto, and more Niagara residents with the virus have died in the last three-and-half weeks than in the preceding nine months. There are 26 long-term care homes or retirement homes with COVID-19 outbreaks in Niagara. The region has a higher percentage of senior residents than the rest of Ontario, about 21 per cent, compared to the Ontario average of 16 per cent, according to Statistics Canada. Hirji said Niagara’s pandemic situation is now on par with hard-hit regions like Peel and Windsor-Essex. When asked Thursday about the Moderna shipment, Health ministry spokesman David Jensen did not answer The Standard’s questions. “Niagara has received shipments of the vaccine, with more shipments expected each week thereafter,” Jensen said in an emailed statement. Niagara has received a shipment of the Pfizer vaccine, and immunizations started Wednesday. Jensen did not reply to follow up questions about the Moderna shipment. Niagara West Conservative MPP Sam Oosterhoff would not agree to an interview Thursday. In an emailed statement, Oosterhoff did not address the Moderna shipment but said he was glad to see Niagara received doses and would get more in coming weeks. St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik said the Niagara Health letter is a strong showing of leadership from Niagara Health and a clear signal to the province that vaccine supply is a concern. “When you look at the devastation and the devastating impact the virus is having in our long-term care homes and our hospitals, we can’t be left further down the list any more,” he said. “We need our fair share.” Last week, Niagara’s 12 mayors and the regional chair sent a letter to Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Health and Solicitor General calling on the province to ensure the region’s frontline health care workers and residents have “equal and timely access” to vaccines compared to other areas of Ontario. Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati pointed to Niagara’s older demographics as a reason the region should get more vaccines, while acknowledging the limited overall supply. Frank Campion, mayor of Welland, said there may be a good reason to divert the Moderna shipment, but leaving Niagara in the dark is unacceptable. Campion expects his city council will pass a resolution supporting the hospital letter next week. Niagara regional Chair Jim Bradley said the entire regional council “will be very supportive” of the doctors’ letter. On Wednesday all three of Niagara’s NDP MPPs — Jeff Burch of Welland, Wayne Gates of Niagara Falls and Jennie Stevens of St. Catharines — urged the government to provide more vaccines to the region. Burch, in a letter to Ford, said Niagara was being treated “unequally” and asked for the Moderna shipment to be restored. Local MPs also voiced concern over the diverted shipment. Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has already shared the Niagara Health letter with his provincial counterparts and shared it “with my shadow minister critic for health in our responsibilities in holding (the federal) government to account on the whole aspect of procuring these drugs.” St. Catharines Liberal MP Chris Bittle said in an interview Thursday the Moderna shipment should not have been diverted “especially with Niagara numbers (of COVID-19 cases) on a per capita basis."" He said the way the province has rolled out the initial allotment of vaccines “seems to be divorced from the reality on the ground in Niagara and that’s frustrating.” Welland Liberal MP Vance Badawey said the situation is “absolutely unacceptable.” “The federal government’s expectation is that the province distribute the vaccine in a fair and equitable manner,” said Badawey.“Here in Niagara, the ship has a hole in it and it’s starting to sink.” Loading...

Publicly, Dr. Mustafa Hirji took to Twitter to urge Premier Doug Ford’s government to send vaccines, and repeated his message in media interviews. But behind the scenes, Hirji was trying to get the provincial government to reverse a decision to redirect vaccines away from Niagara. His public health department was scheduled to receive doses of the Moderna vaccine, which would have gone into the arms of Niagara long-term care residents and front-line health care workers. The vaccine was redirected elsewhere without explanation, prompting a flurry of phone calls from Hirji. “We worked our channels to the provincial government. You’ll have to ask (the health) ministry where those doses went, but it seemed to coincide with the provincial government’s announcement that they wanted to get every long term care resident in Toronto, Peel, York and Windsor-Essex vaccinated,” Hirji said. “Last week you saw that I was very vocal about the need to get vaccines to Niagara. So this is some of the context around that.” While Niagara did receive doses of the Pfizer vaccine — inoculations for the region’s long-term care residents began Wednesday morning — the Moderna doses aren’t coming. “This does definitely slow down our efforts to vaccinate our most vulnerable residents,” said Hirji. He said he cannot discuss the size of the Moderna shipment because the issue has been deemed confidential by the Ontario Solicitor General’s office, which is in charge of vaccine security. Hirji said to change the Moderna decision now would mean taking the vaccine away from another community, something he doesn’t think the province will do. Nevertheless, the decision prompted the Wednesday publication of an open letter by Niagara Health’s top physicians to Niagara community leaders, urging them to insist the province sent more vaccines, and restore the “unfairly taken away” Moderna shipment. “It has been particularly disheartening for us in Niagara to see that we are not being treated equitably with other areas in the province. There are 32 long-term care homes in Niagara and not one healthcare worker, not one resident received the vaccine prior to today. In contrast, Windsor has 19 long-term care homes and has already vaccinated all of them,” says the letter. “Shockingly, some people in other jurisdictions have received their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine before a single dose made its way into our community. Our older adults and healthcare workers deserve better. “We can administer vaccines as quickly as they are provided. Volunteers are lining up to support this initiative. All we need are vaccines.” Hirji said in early December when the initial and limited doses of Pfizer vaccine — the first to be approved for use by Health Canada — arrived in Ontario, the provincial government had to make a “risk-based” decision on where the first doses would go. Regions like Toronto and Peel were already in red or lockdown zones of the provincial COVID-19 restriction plans and were targeted first for vaccines. “That was understandable,” Hirji said. “Niagara was in orange at that time. So that decision made sense.” Since then the COVID-19 situation in Niagara has rapidly deteriorated. Since Boxing Day, more than 100 people with the virus, most of them long-term care residents, have died. Outbreaks in those homes have spread quickly, infecting hundreds of residents and staff. So while Hirji said the initial vaccine decision by Queen’s Park made sense, they don’t anymore. Niagara, he said, is not being treated fairly. “We are now in the same ballpark as placed like Toronto and Hamilton,” Hirji said. “To make matters worse, we now know that in some jurisdictions to pad their (vaccination) numbers, low-risk health care staff are getting their first doses instead of those doses going to a place like Niagara which has many people at high risk.” Those low-risk people have received their second doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before some Niagara long-term care residents can get their first shots. Niagara Health physicians circulated their letter online Wednesday afternoon, prompting a quick reaction from at least two local MPPs. St. Catharines NDP Jennie Stevens and Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates both issued statements calling on the Ford government to send Moderna vaccines to the region immediately. “We ask you to reconsider this choice to divert the Moderna vaccine from Niagara and instead expedite the delivery of this life-saving medication, which would’ve gone to the most vulnerable population in care,” wrote Stevens. “Our public health officials and frontline staff have taken over long term care homes that have been left to struggle in Niagara, and they are risking burnout and further loss of staff that exceeds over 400 members already in Niagara.” Gates said the longer the province delays sending vaccines to Niagara, the greater to risk to residents. “Niagara has horrible outbreaks in long-term care homes that can be stopped if we are given our fair share of the vaccines — both of Moderna and Pfizer. Families deserve this, workers deserve to be safe and the rest of our community — especially our seniors — needs to know when they’ll be receiving the vaccine.”—— Letter from Niagara Health doctors to Niagara community leaders: January 13th, 2021 We are writing to request your urgent help. Niagara has received its first shipment of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. It is a day we have been waiting for since the first vaccines were administered in Ontario on December 14, 2020. Over the past month, COVID spread in Niagara has become increasingly serious and we need your help to advocate for Niagara’s fair share of vaccines. As physicians and healthcare workers on the frontlines of this near year-long battle with the pandemic, we want to recognize all the hard work done by our colleagues to protect the health and safety of our community and the numerous lives they have saved under the most difficult of circumstances. Today, we are caring for 62 COVID-positive patients in hospital, with 12 patients in Intensive Care. During the first week of the New Year, we cared for as many as 93 patients in a single day at the hospital. Sadly, 90 patients being treated for COVID have died, with 50 of those deaths taking place since the onset of the second wave in the fall of 2020. Additionally, Niagara Health has been called upon to manage and protect the residents of two long-term care homes. Our teams risked their own health and well-being to enter these homes and provide the life-saving support to residents. In particular, one of the homes we are supporting is experiencing one of the most significant outbreaks anywhere in Ontario, with 96 per cent of the home’s 122 residents testing positive for the virus. Thirty residents have died and 121 staff were infected. In short, the virus is heavily impacting our region. Our teams are burned out; people are worried for their loved ones and they need hope. Hope that the vaccine offers. While we are pleased to receive the initial shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, the reality is that it’s not enough. It’s not enough to vaccinate our vulnerable population and not enough to guarantee continuous operation of your hospital system. This is compounded by the inexplicable diversion of the Moderna vaccine, which would have gone to the most vulnerable population that we care for in Niagara. It has been particularly disheartening for us in Niagara to see that we are not being treated equitably with other areas in the province. There are 32 long-term care homes in Niagara and not one healthcare worker, not one resident received the vaccine prior to today. In contrast, Windsor has 19 long-term care homes and has already vaccinated all of them. The same is true for York Region’s 28 homes. This frustration is multiplied by regular reports of individuals, who are not eligible under the government’s own criteria, being vaccinated against COVID prior to those who desperately need it in Niagara. Shockingly, some people in other jurisdictions have received their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine before a single dose made its way into our community. Our older adults and healthcare workers deserve better. The virus is taking its toll on staff and physicians at the hospital. More than 220 of our teammates have tested positive for COVID and nearly 200 others are having to isolate for potential exposure. While we appreciate that the public sometimes refers to healthcare workers as heroes, we are not superhuman. With the spread of infection, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain services in the hospital and continue to save lives. We are not far from our system being overwhelmed. The hospital system is currently dealing with 8 units on outbreak, including one of our COVID units, one of our ICU’s and two of our emergency departments. Along with our colleagues, we have provided care for patients at their worst moments of suffering and vulnerability. We are committed and dedicated to doing everything we can to care for our community. The government can help us by directing additional vaccines to Niagara. By vaccinating healthcare workers, you are protecting services in the hospital and ensuring that we are able to continue providing care to those who most need it. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... In closing, we ask our community and leaders to support this urgent call for action. Join us in requiring the Ontario Government allocate more Pfizer vaccines to Niagara and restore the allocation of the Moderna vaccine that was unfairly taken away. We can administer vaccines as quickly as they are provided. Volunteers are lining up to support this initiative. All we need are vaccines. We ask that you share our message on social media, encourage your friends to write to our Members of Provincial Parliament and request that they take our message to the highest levels of government. Niagara deserves to be treated equitably and we need additional vaccines as soon as possible.

Mayor Frank Campion said it is important to the community and region to not just receive and support the letter from the health system’s top doctors, but to do more. The motion at Tuesday’s city council meeting urges the provincial government to immediately allocate more Pfizer vaccines to Niagara “and restore the allocation of Moderna unfairly taken away.” It will go to all local area municipalities, all MPPs and Niagara Health’s medical advisory committee. The mayor will send Premier Doug Ford a letter on behalf of Welland city council as well. “We need to impress on the province that we need the vaccines as much as anyone else. And at this point probably more than anyone else in Ontario,” said Campion during the meeting. He said it was unfortunate Niagara took a back seat when it came to the Moderna vaccine. “We are a priority, and we need the province to recognize that we are a priority.” Campion said the vaccines are needed to support front-line workers in the health system and long-term-care homes, the people taking care of those who are sick. People living in long-term-care homes, the most vulnerable, need the vaccine as soon as possible as well, the mayor added. Without the vaccines, he said the health system could fall apart. “This is step one,” Campion said of the motion. “There will be more steps moving forward.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Provincial government downplays Niagara’s COVID-19 crisis, still refuses to explain diverted vaccine shipment Jan. 19, 2021 Editorial Premier, take a good look at Niagara’s COVID-19 cases Jan. 19, 2021 Niagara Region Niagara reports 108 new COVID cases; Trudeau issues travel warning Jan. 19, 2021 Ward 1 Coun.

While Niagara’s top public health official said the province appears to be listening to his department and his colleagues at Niagara Health, that hasn’t translated to help for the region. “I think they are listening to us,” said Dr. Mustafa Hirji. “But we aren’t seeing action as a result of what we are telling them.” During a Tuesday afternoon press conference with Premier Doug Ford, retired general Rick Hillier — he leads the provincial vaccination task force — was asked by a reporter about 5,500 doses of Moderna vaccine scheduled to be delivered to Niagara but sent elsewhere last week. The shipment was on its way to the health department, and the joint public health/Niagara Health vaccine task force was planning the rollout when the shipment was diverted without an explanation. Hillier did not discuss the Niagara shipment, nor answer a question about where it went and why. He said sometimes provincial plans change to ensure vaccines go where they are needed. “It is not about taking it away from one place and giving to another,” said Hillier, although that is what happened in the cases of the Moderna shipment. Hillier is the latest Ontario government official to avoid discussing the shipment. Spokespeople for Ford’s office, the Ministry of Health and Niagara West MPP Sam Oosterhoff have all refused to answer questions about the diverted vaccine doses. Hillier’s comments came a day after Ontario’s top public health official said Niagara’s COVID-19 metrics — they have been rapidly deteriorating since early December — have just become problematic. “Niagara has only recently gone up in the last two weeks,” said Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s medical officer of health, referring to Niagara’s cases per 100,000 which last week exceeded Toronto’s, becoming the fourth-highest rate in the province. “They are dealing with some issues around long-term care, workplace outbreaks, is this a sign of wide community spread? It is not a clear metric, but we work it out with them,” Williams said. Hirji said for months Niagara has been seeing broad community spread of the novel coronavirus. Through the fall, people under the age of 40 — particularly young adults in their 20s — were the key demographic spreading the virus among themselves at bars, restaurants and gatherings. From those groups, older demographics contracted the virus — including at least one superspreader cluster that triggered two long-term-care home outbreaks. Hirji said in a Tuesday interview Niagara’s COVID-19 dam broke about Dec. 5 as community spread of the virus lead to more cases in households, workplaces, health-care settings and long-term-care homes. “Perhaps what (Williams) is referring to is that in early December while the metrics were rising, they weren’t that bad yet,” said Hirji. “But when vaccines were announced around Dec. 15, things had changed quite a bit, and we should have been in the red zone.” On Monday Lynn Guerriero, president and acting chief executive officer of Niagara Health, said she and other local health-care leaders were sounding the COVID-19 alarm for the province in early December because Niagara’s pandemic data signalled an impending crisis. Local health officials told the province Niagara should be moved from the orange pandemic alert level to the more restrictive red zone, which would have put Niagara in line for earlier vaccine rollouts to protect people living and working in long-term-care homes. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Niagara left behind in COVID-19 vaccine rollout Jan. 18, 2021 By mid-December, before the start of the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine in red zone regions, several key metrics in Niagara were either at or above red zone thresholds. However, Niagara was not moved into red alert until Dec. 21, and by then cases, outbreaks and deaths were sharply rising. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Guerriero and Hirji said local warnings were not heeded by the province. Even after Niagara was placed into the red zone there was no change in the provincial vaccine rollout plan. Niagara received its first Pfizer shipments only last week. Since Dec. 21, 131 Niagara residents infected with the virus have died, the vast majority of them elderly residents of long-term-care and retirement homes. Since the start of the pandemic, 230 people in Niagara with COVID-19 have died. “Eighty per cent of them are residents of long-term-care homes,” said Hirji. “Our focus, and I have been saying this for a while, is to get the vaccine in those homes to protect those most vulnerable to the virus.” Grant LaFleche is a St. Catharines-based investigative reporter with the Standard.

We know you can hear us here in Niagara. We are sinking deeper and deeper into the COVID-19 quicksand here. Our neighbours and family members are dying at an alarming rate — 121 of us have died since Christmas Day, in case you hadn’t heard the news, Premier. In the past nine days alone 20 COVID-19 patients have died in our hospitals. Niagara has more active cases than Hamilton, Burlington and Oakville combined. If there is someone up there at Queen’s Park you could wake up to hear our cries for help, we’d appreciate it. Try coming down on them like that 800-pound gorilla you talk about every so often. Maybe that will get their attention. Sam Oosterhoff, we know you’re out there, too, somewhere. Are you listening? We appreciated your announcement about two weeks ago that, finally, Niagara would get a share of the Pfizer vaccines and start our rollout here like so many other places had already done. But as Niagara’s only representative in the provincial government, the MPP for Niagara West, we really wish you could explain to us why our 5,500 doses of that other vaccine, made by Moderna, were sent somewhere else. Yeah, it was earmarked for us but diverted to another region without explanation. When we tried to ask you how that happened, you answered by praising the government’s rollout of the Pfizer vaccine. We’d have liked to ask for clarification, but you weren’t doing interviews with Niagara’s daily newspapers, just releasing written statements. Right now, Niagara could really use a strong voice in government and it’s not clear that we have one. Just a reminder — a local MPP is meant to be Niagara’s voice at Queen’s Park, not the other way around. The fact is, Niagara is tired of letting the data do the talking. As Niagara Health president and acting chief executive officer Lynn Guerriero said this week, even back in December an alarm bell should have been ringing at Queen’s Park over what was happening here. Premier Ford was earmarking shipments of the newly approved Pfizer vaccine for areas of the province in the red zone, but Niagara was officially in orange still. “We should have been in the red zone at that point,” said Guerriero. The numbers at the time proved Niagara was clearly heading to a bad place. Even then, local health officials were pleading for the region to be moved to red and onto the vaccine list. “Shortly after (the vaccine plan was announced) things changed here very, very rapidly and we were in the red zone,” said Guerriero. “But there was no adjustment in the vaccine plan.” So we waited. And waited. The numbers got worse. Finally, we got some vaccine — then Niagara, like the rest of Canada, learns Pfizer will reduce shipments soon while it expands one of its production facilities. Despite the COVID-19 data, despite our health officials’ calls for assistance, despite our growing list of coronavirus illnesses and deaths, despite having a far higher seniors population than other regions, our share of the vaccine arrived too late. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... And then, to add insult to injury some of it was redirected elsewhere. It didn’t have to be this way. The border that ties us to New York state has been closed for months, yet sometimes it feels like Niagara is just as shut off from Toronto. Premier Ford, are you listening?

Or is it because we failed to elect a Conservative member to Doug Ford’s government here in Niagara Falls that a premier elected to represent all Ontarians has diverted the Moderna vaccine earmarked for Niagara? Every member of council should be outraged and on every media outlet expressing anger long and loud. We have seniors. We have frontline workers and first responders. We have high risk individuals. We have outbreaks. We have friends and family infected, people are dying here — and our numbers are spiking! We also had floods of locked-down Metro Toronto area residents exercising their rights to travel, usually mask-free, to enjoy open businesses, parks, amusements and hotel amenities. In Niagara. I have repeatedly heard Doug Ford’s handling of the epidemic described as “Compassionate (wait for it)... incompetence.” Redirection of vaccines over physicians and medical experts’ objections — failing to equitably distribute essential aid — is not incompetent. It is political, like much the mishandling of the epidemic to date. The only card I have ever carried was for the Progressive Conservative Party! For whom do you think I will be out stumping in the next provincial election? For the remainder of my life. COVID willing. Just heard Ford decided to send Moderna vaccine here after all. Must have seen a poll, eh? Andrew Kirkpatrick Niagara Falls Politicians must put egos aside and get vaccine in people’s arms Re: First Niagara vaccination a “momentous” milestone in fight against COVID-19, Jan. 13 Albert Einstein once said, “More the knowledge, lesser the ego. Lesser the knowledge, more the ego.” If Niagara region, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the rest of the world want to eradicate this pandemic, they have to realize there are two enemies; the virus and ego. Premier Doug Ford has done an OK job in managing fears and trying to quell fear. However, after a poll had him and the PCs ahead of their political opponents in early December, he has taken his foot off the pedal and is now riding the brake. Leaders lead. People forget the fact it was Rudy Giuliani as mayor in 2001 who told New Yorkers by radio and TV to evacuate lower Manhattan as the buildings fell, to allow emergency vehicles room to move. When the media first asked him how many people had died, he simply said: “At the moment, the number would be too overwhelming for people so let’s focus on rescuing as many people as we can.” That, to me, was leadership. Ford, along with every cockamamie “Vaccination Task Force” that provincial and municipal governments are trying to attach their faces to, are not going to defeat this enemy.

He used his opening remarks at Tuesday’s city council meeting to ask for public compliance. “Adhere to the regulations, adhere to your responsibility to stop the spread of COVID-19,” he said. “If we don’t, our health system will be overrun. It’s almost there now,” he added. He stressed the importance of protecting front-line health-care workers and employees of long-term care homes. “Please follow the rules, do everything you can to ensure we get the curve under control,” said Campion. On Thursday, Ali Khan, the city’s supervisor of traffic, parking and bylaw enforcement, said no fines have been handed out by his staff since the start of the pandemic, not factoring fines that have been handed out by police. It is unknown how many fines have been issued by Niagara Regional Police in Welland during the pandemic. Police did not immediately respond for comment Thursday. On Jan. 12, eight people were each given $880 tickets at a residence in the area of Cozy and Duncan streets for not following the rules, police said at the time. According to data on Niagara Region’s website, there were 113 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday and a total of 6,995 since the start of the pandemic. There are 1,585 active cases; 244 deaths have been recorded to date. On Thursday, there were 190 newly resolved cases, and 5,166 resolved cases. Loading...

We are fully prepared to continue supporting students and families with remote learning.” On Wednesday, Ontario announced schools in Grey Bruce, Peterborough, Haliburton and Kingston are among those in southern Ontario allowed to open their doors to students to attend class in person, starting Monday. Schools in the north welcomed children back this past Monday, with a few exceptions in communities that saw a sharp jump in cases over the holidays. The seven areas where elementary and secondary students can resume in-person learning on Jan. 25 are: Haliburton/Kawartha/Pine Ridge; Peterborough; Grey Bruce; Hastings/Prince Edward; Leeds/Grenville/Lanark; Renfrew; Kingston/Frontenac/Lennox & Addington. Students in all other southern Ontario public health districts, including Niagara, will remain online for now, and the government gave no specific timeline other than to say the chief medical officer of health will monitor COVID-19 cases and determine when kids can return. “We continue to find ways to ensure that students are actively engaged during the school day and that we meet the needs of students wherever they are in their learning,” said Niagara Catholic District School Board education director Camillo Cipriano. “We understand that all of this is difficult, and we are so proud of the excellent work that is happening online by our students, teachers, administrators and support staff to keep advancing learning.” Despite confidence in their abilities to navigate the uncharted waters that is a global pandemic, neither of Niagara’s public or Catholic boards have received any indication regarding the criteria the education ministry or the province’s chief medical officer of health has set for schools to reopen safely. “Creating a one-size-fits-all approach to school reopening is a challenge,” Cipriano said. “We have regular meetings with the ministry and public health and will continue to look forward to open dialogue with the ministry through the end of the school year.” He added, “We did receive requests for technology support and assistance from families when schools first reopened after the Christmas break and have supported families with their requests. We recognize that as this continues, families may experience technology issues for many reasons, and we encourage them to contact their child’s school if they do have challenges.” DSBN also acknowledged hardships of remote learning.

Protecting our students, staff and their families remains our top priority.” — With files from the Toronto Star Sean Vanderklis is a Niagara-based reporter for the Niagara Falls Review.

Niagara Region Welland bans hockey at outdoor public skating surfaces By Kris DubéTribune Reporter Tue., Jan. 12, 2021timer2 min. read Complaints received over the weekend about large gatherings have resulted in the City of Welland implementing a ban on hockey at its outdoor skating surfaces. There were reports of groups at Chippawa Park’s large pond, as well as at Woodlawn Park, where a trail that winds through a forest regularly draws skaters. Lacing up and going for a few strides is permitted, but dropping a puck and nets on the ice is no longer allowed, said Grant Munday, the city’s interim director of development and building services. “It’s an unfortunate measure we have to take but we’re trying to balance this virus with the need for people to get outdoor activity,” said Munday, the municipality’s manager of development approvals who has taken on his temporary role as a result of changes at city hall. Later Tuesday, new restrictions were put into effect by the province, which declared an emergency order. “Outdoor organized public gatherings and social gatherings are further restricted to a limit of five people with limited exceptions,” the province said. “This is consistent with the rules during the lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 in spring 2020 and will allow individuals and families to enjoy time outdoors safely,” the government said. Munday said there “were some concerns about people congregating on the ice,” referring to activity on the weekend. Complaints about groups and scrimmage hockey games during business hours should be directed to the city, and after-hours reports should be directed to Niagara Regional Police, said Munday. Const. Jesse Vujasic said police responded to Chippawa Park on Sunday, but no fines were assessed. “There were no large groups, just parties making use of the pond and everyone was practising safe distancing,” she said. “We have not received any further calls in regard to members of the public not following COVID-19 restrictions while tobogganing or skating outdoors.” She said the NRP will be adding outdoor rinks to patrol routes and investigate complaints as they come in. Asked about bleachers that sit at Woodlawn Park serving as a gathering spot, Munday said “that’s something we will have to look at,” pointing out that they are meant to be a place for people to lace up and take off skates. Tobogganing is permitted under the provincial lockdown. Munday said if more snow falls and people congregate at local hills, it will be another area to monitor. Mason Saxton and his friend Spencer Brown, both Grade 9 students at Centennial Secondary School, were taking a break from online learning Tuesday afternoon by going for a skate, hockey sticks in hand, at Chippawa Park. RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Three outdoor community ice rinks waiting for freeze in St. Catharines Jan. 11, 2021 Told the city is putting a ban on hockey at outdoor public spaces, Saxton said it will be tough for people his age to deal with. “I understand they don’t want a group of people, but we already have so little to do and this is one of the spots we can come to enjoy themselves,” said the 14-year-old.

Wineries of Niagara-on-the-Lake, an organization that brings more than 20 town wineries together, held a recent meeting to discuss what they can do to keep the outdoor experience alive as temperatures drop. On the other side, a small handful of restaurants recently sent a letter to NOTL council, hoping to have the extended patio permit deadline of Oct. 31 moved into November or beyond. “Me and a couple (of) other restaurant owners sent in a letter, just asking to extend the patio season in case we do end up with a beautiful fall,” said Kim Gauld, co-owner of Sunset Grill on Queen Street. Gauld also sits on the NOTL chamber of commerce board and has been at the forefront of the heritage district merchant group since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’ve even asked if (council) can give us an early notice of an extension to next year so we can start planning ahead,” Gauld said. Her restaurant has invested in outdoor heaters on the patio, and although expensive, she said it has helped a little. Other restaurant owners have also thought of making the investment, but want to confirm patio permits are extended to make sure they aren’t making a large purchase for only a month’s use. Andrea Kaiser, chair of Wineries of Niagara-on-the-Lake, said members met two weeks ago to discuss heaters, among other things. “A lot of the wineries had heard on the news that it was becoming virtually impossible to actually order outdoor heaters, so we frantically, a number of us, went online to order some heaters,” Kaiser said. With COVID-19 cases on the rise across Ontario and Premier Doug Ford saying the province is officially in the second wave, wineries are hoping they’ll be considered an essential business if another lockdown occurs. “I would say anxieties like other businesses are high and certainly the unknowns always provide for more stress when you don’t know what’s going to happen and you can’t sort of make a plan,” Kaiser said. But the organization, along with its members, is trying to be proactive and look at every scenario to best position themselves to “weather the storm,” Kaiser said. . Wineries being able to keep their stores open for curbside pickup, Kaiser said, proved to be a lifesaver earlier this year. Home deliveries of wines also exploded, and it was a major help for those town wineries that don’t have distribution across Ontario. Virtual tastings also grew much more popular and will most likely be continued, with or without a second lockdown. The biggest excitement for wineries is the ability to present their signature “Taste the Season” event, through an at-home experience. Kaiser called it “Taste the Season at Home,” which will be released Oct. 1. While the at-home experience will be crucial for those who don’t feel comfortable leaving their residences, wineries are hoping to make outdoor seating as comfortable as possible beyond the purchase of heaters. “We have a number of wineries that are looking at some really unique, and I think really exciting, winter programs because Canadians, Ontarians — even if we do hit a second wave (of the) pandemic, they will still be seeking outdoor experiences if allowed,” Kaiser said. The examples Kaiser provided of programs included cross-country skiing or snowshoeing in a vineyard, or offering mulled wines or warm beverages while sitting outdoors. RELATED STORIES Business Niagara Falls MPP Wayne Gates introduces bill to support Ontario wineries Oct. 01, 2020 Business Niagara’s craft wineries facing uncertain future as impact of pandemic and taxes take hold Sep. 03, 2020 Kaiser expects some of the winter plans to be announced in the coming weeks. Discussions are also being had with the chamber about what a potential Icewine Festival could look like, such as extending the street footprint to allow for more physical distancing. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “We’re trying to remain positive; we’re trying to think outside the box,” Kaiser said. While each day potentially presents a new change or an unknown, restaurants and wineries in town are continuing to follow safety and health protocols put forward by public health. Kaiser said some wineries have even mandated that masks be worn outdoors and only be removed when being seated on patios. It’s a guessing game of what tomorrow could look like for restaurants and wineries, but they’re hopeful patio season becomes much more than a summer trend.

And other city staff were asked to stay home in the last month due to potential exposure. “As of the morning, no one is off as a result of a positive COVID-19 test,” Zorbas said Monday. The first case came last November when an employee in the public works department went into self-isolation after it was reported they had been infected by the virus. A second city employee tested positive and last worked on Dec. 24. The city did not say what department the person worked in. Mark Slade, Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 1115 president, said the union would like to see more timely notices when it comes to COVID-19 exposure or positive tests. “We were notified a week after that fact,” he said of the most recent positive test. Slade said the union also wants to know which employees were exposed or tested positive. “Knowing who it is will let all of us know whether we have been close contact or not. “We know (Niagara Region) public health does contract tracing, but it’s easier when you know who it is and do you own due diligence,” said Slade. If a municipal employee believes they’ve been exposed to the virus, they are asked to contact the region’s public health unit and get direction from them, Zorbas said. “Public health makes a decision and updates our human resources (department) on what the best approach is.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Reduced Welland bylaw department in state of emergency ‘doesn’t make sense’: Union president Jan. 21, 2021 Niagara Region Welland’s communications co-ordinator leaves city Jan. 06, 2021 Niagara Region Provincial lockdown to keep Welland wellness complex closed; another employee leaves the city Dec. 22, 2020 Though city hall is closed to the public, Zorbas said physical distancing protocols in place. “We’re encouraging our staff to work at home,” he said.

The president of Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 1115, which represents about 150 city employees, including bylaw and parking enforcement, told the Welland Tribune Thursday that two bylaw staffers have been laid off recently — one a part-time employee “just before Christmas,” as well as a full-timer about two weeks ago. “I’m not sure why they’re being laid off when enforcement is required,” said Slade, sworn in as local president late last year. Throughout the pandemic, Welland bylaw staff have focused on education rather than enforcement of rules. When the province’s second state of emergency took effect in mid-January, the government gave authority to all provincial offences officers, including police, bylaw officers,and provincial workplace inspectors, to issue tickets to individuals who do not comply with stay-at-home orders, or to people not wearing a face-covering indoors in places open to the public, for example. Bylaw officers now have authority to temporarily close a premise and disperse individuals who are in contravention of gathering limits. “In a pandemic, you have to treat it like a pandemic,” said Slade, adding now “doesn’t make any sense” to shrink a bylaw department. In St. Catharines, the city plans to double its small bylaw enforcement team to enforce COVID-19 emergency orders by deputizing members of other departments. Staff from municipal works, finance and engineering, facilities and environmental services offered to temporarily join the bylaw team. The city had four officers responsible for municipal bylaw enforcement. St. Catharines planning and building services director Tami Kitay said the city identified an additional four to nine people who will be brought on to lend support for COVID-19 enforcement. Grant Munday, Welland’s interim director of development and building services, a new department title created at city hall that encompasses the bylaw department, said the city has no plans to shuffle employees. “Our existing staff levels are adequate to handle COVID-19 issues. We have no plans to deputize other staff at this time,” he said. Slade said redeploying city staff to work in bylaw enforcement would pose challenges — mostly with putting people in positions they are not trained for. Often, when a potential $880 fine is a topic of discussion upon visits to homes and businesses, “very angry people” are encountered. This is a safety risk for those who are new to confrontation that licensed officers are familiar with, he said. He said having staff from other departments work alongside a trained bylaw staffer would “maybe work.” RELATED STORIES Council St. Catharines city staff to be deputized as bylaw officers for COVID-19 enforcement Jan. 20, 2021 Niagara Region People gathered at Table Rock issued $880 fines for violating COVID-19 rules Jan. 16, 2021 Niagara Region Police say charges pending in event to ‘arrest’ St. Catharines mayor Jan. 14, 2021 Niagara Region Eight people fined $880 each under COVID rules for indoor gathering in Welland Jan. 12, 2021 Like Munday, chief administrative officer Steve Zorbas also said city resources are adequate, adding the municipality would be making “no further comments” on the department matter.

Chief administrative officer Steve Zorbas confirmed Bernice Booth parted ways with the city but could not say why she left, citing personnel issues. “We wish her well.” Booth is the latest employee to leave the city. In late December, community development/volunteer co-ordinator Krista Bowie left, and in early 2020 arts and culture co-ordinator Cassandra Magazzeni parted ways with the city. Both worked out of Welland Community Wellness Complex on Lincoln Street. Zorbas also confirmed that at least one employee inside city hall was laid off this week. “With the province announcing a lockdown in December until Jan. 23 we had an additional layoff,” he said, adding Welland Transit laid off staff late last year as the city and Niagara Region Transit reduced service levels. Last April, the city handed out 101 temporary layoff notices to various casual, full-time and part-time staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Welland Public Library, Welland Museum and transit also had layoffs as programs were cut due to the pandemic and ridership dropped on buses. Staff members were slowly brought back to work as restrictions eased throughout the summer. Zorbas said the decision to lay staff off is never easy and occurs if there is no opportunity to redeploy the person to a position in which their skills can be used. Mark Slade, Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 1115 president, said the staff person laid off Monday could have been redeployed to help out in other ways. “The option was given to human resources, but that seems to have been disregarded. There’s no reason we can’t redeploy people,” said Slade, whose union represents 72 employees inside city hall and public works. He said Welland taxpayers have paid to have services provided to them and there’s no reason they can’t be offered. “It’s not all about trying to save a dollar when the taxpayer has already paid it,” said Slade. Zorbas, also Welland’s chief financial officer, said the city has to look at its financial situation and that the emergency management team meets three times a week to discuss such issues. Slade said Monday’s layoff is just another mess at city hall. He cited the three-week closure of the wellness complex, with three of the four staff members there forced to use vacation time or take unpaid leave. In addition to the latest layoff, Slade raised concern over some staff not wearing masks inside city hall when outside their work stations and at least one bringing a child inside the closed-to-the-public facility Monday. “No one is exempt from the rules. It just shows a lack of respect for fellow workers inside the same building,” he said. Zorbas said staff are advised to wear masks and he was unaware of any issues. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... “If staff observes someone not wearing a mask they can bring it to the attention of their general manager, human resources or my office.” Slade questioned the feasibility of Zorbas’s suggestion, noting the staff not wearing masks were members of the city management team. “It would be uncomfortable for staff to tell their supervisors/managers to wear a mask, and why should they have to?” he said. “If our governments are requesting that workplaces follow their policies in mitigating the spread of this virus and management doesn’t follow these rules, who is it that we are to turn to for our safety? It’s very disturbing.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Welland city hall employee tests positive for COVID-19 Jan. 04, 2021 Niagara Region Provincial lockdown to keep Welland wellness complex closed; another employee leaves the city Dec. 22, 2020 As for a staff member bringing a child into city hall, Zorbas wasn’t aware of it, but said it’s not the norm. “I would assume it was for logistical reasons.” He said if an employee brings their child into city hall, they must go through the same screening process and protocols, which include wearing a mask, sanitizing their hands, having their temperature taken and answering a COVID-19 questionnaire. “They are not treated any differently.” Zorbas said staff are expected to use good judgment if they bring a child into the office and they can always seek approval from him if required. Slade said CUPE is be heading into contract negotiations in the near future as its contract expired on Dec. 31. Zorbas expects the talks with CUPE to start in February and said the city will also be in talks with Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1633, which represents Welland Transit workers.

The latest departure is that of community development/volunteer co-ordinator Krista Bowie, who worked out of Welland Community Wellness Complex. Earlier this year, arts and culture co-ordinator Cassandra Magazzeni, who also worked out of the wellness complex, left the city. Asked about Bowie’s departure, recreation and culture manager Richard Dalton said the city does not comment on personnel matters. Bowie left the city before it announced a three-week closure of the wellness complex, approved by council last week. The closure came into effect this past Sunday was to last until Monday, Jan. 11. “It’s to capture the two-week holiday season along with an additional week in January, due to no programming scheduled until Jan. 18,” said Dalton. He said under the red zone restrictions, put in place Monday, up to 10 people would have been allowed in the building at 145 Lincoln St. and added programs would have been adjusted accordingly. Before the red zone restrictions, Dalton said the wellness complex saw about 50 people daily between programming periods. “Residents have been cautiously returning but on a very limited basis,” he added. The city announced the temporary closure last week, after council approved it at its meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 15. The red zone restriction, which took effect Monday of this week, was announced by the province on Friday, Dec. 18. As southern Ontario moves into full lockdown on Boxing Day, Dalton said a full closure is required until restrictions are lifted. Forty winter programs were set to start on Jan. 18. With the closure, only one of four city employees will remain on-site answering phones, said Slade. He said the other three will take vacation time or unpaid leave during that time. “Those were their options.” Slade said staff were not happy having to take vacation time they had planned to save. “They are coming to work upset and crying. It’s not a good scene. We’re going into (contract) negotiations soon, this makes matters worse.” RELATED STORIES Niagara Region Welland layoffs results in lack of maintenance on city properties May. 26, 2020 Niagara Region Welland city hall inside workers ’not happy,’ says CUPE May. 10, 2020 Niagara Region Temporary layoff notices handed to 101 City of Welland staff Apr. 03, 2020 He wondered why the three employees weren’t redeployed instead. “We could use people in other departments at city hall or public works. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be redeployed, it’s a simple solution” said Slade. Dalton couldn’t speak about the redeployment of city staff or whether it would have made more sense to lay off the employees. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...

Staff were slowly brought back to work as restrictions eased throughout the summer. Dave Johnson is a St. Catharines-based reporter for the Welland Tribune.

The lowering of the flags is “also a reminder that we all share a responsibility to stop the spread of this deadly pandemic that has taken such a devastating toll,” said the mayor. “We can collectively save lives and ultimately end the pandemic by following the rules. The number of lives lost and the speed at which they are being lost, particularly in our seniors’ population, is unacceptable so we must act now.” The flags will be lowered until at least Wednesday, Campion said. The province’s stay-at-home order was issued Jan. 14. “Before going out, ask yourself if you must do so and avoid all unnecessary travel. By working together, getting everyone vaccinated and supporting our front-line workers we will succeed,” the city said in the release. On Thursday afternoon, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in Niagara since March 2020 was 299. There are three known confirmed cases at Welland city hall throughout the pandemic. Earlier this week, the city confirmed its third case in an employee since the start of the pandemic, but did not disclose what department that person works in. The first case came last November when an employee in the public works department tested positive. A second city employee tested positive and last worked on Dec. 24. The city did not say what department the person was employed by. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati and Niagara-on-the-Lake Lord Mayor Betty Disero issued a joint statement Tuesday afternoon, saying the virus situation is being continually monitored and remains under control. With Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake being the biggest attractors of visitors to the region, Diodati and Disero said residents and businesses have shown increased interest as to local impacts from COVID-19. With the high volume of public transit use in Niagara Falls, city staff are investigating long-lasting microbial treatments, as well as implementation of proper signage, notification tactics and training for employees. City and town staff have been actively reviewing emergency procedures and business continuity plans to ensure safe and seamless service remain available to residents and the public. Staff and emergency-service departments from both municipalities are working closely with public health for illness prevention and communication. ""We have been in touch with those organizations in our areas who typically draw visitors and have ensured that they have their own protocols and procedures in place as well,"" said the statement. ""We are being proactive as communities."" There are no confirmed coronavirus cases in the region. If the situation changes, the public will be notified immediately, the statement said. The mayors encourage residents to adhere to prevention guidelines laid out by Niagara Region Public Health, including to stay home if you're sick, wash your hands, cover your cough or sneeze, keep your distance, avoid sharing personal items, and clean and disinfect.

The City of Niagara Falls released a statement Thursday afternoon that out of an abundance of caution, and with the understanding that large gatherings of people indoors at this time could contribute to the potential spread of COVID-19, plans to host the event will temporarily pause. The decision to suspend the event was made in consultation with Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce, taking into consideration the latest information from the public health department, other levels of government and a commitment to the public to make appropriate choices to protect the health of members of the community. ""Though the latest messaging from the World Health Organization is measured but precautionary, we are committed to doing our part to containing the virus,"" said Diodati. ""It no longer seems appropriate to go ahead with plans for an event with large numbers of people in attendance."" Organizers said planning for the event will resume and a rescheduled date will be announced as soon as the time is appropriate.

Although there have been no reported COVID-19 cases in Niagara, health officials said it is only a matter of time before the virus reached the region, so the local hospital system laying the groundwork to deal with it. ""We have been on top of this since mid-January when we created an emergency operations committee,"" said Dr. Johan Viljoen, Niagara Health chief of staff. ""We have been meeting on preparedness on a daily basis since then."" That the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic does not mean there is an outbreak in Niagara, he said, but it does heighten the need for proactive measures. The assessment centres — one will be in Niagara Falls and the other in St. Catharines — will allow doctors to test patients for the rapidly spreading virus without the risk of exposing patients in local emergency rooms, said Viljoen. ""At the moment when a person meets the criteria for screening, they are directed to our emergency departments,"" he said, noting 25 people locally have been tested. All the results were negative for COVID-19. ""We want to work to minimize that and these assessment centres will assess patients for the need for screening and do the testing."" Viljoen said there are still ""a number of details still to be worked out"" regarding the centres. Once they are, which he expects will be in about a week's time, Niagara Health will share details with the community. Establishing the testing centres, which Viljoen said will not be located in a hospital, is part of an overall COVID-19 strategy for the hospital system. Viljoen said Niagara Health is cancelling work-related travel for staff, including conferences, and requiring employees who travel for personal reasons to be screened before returning to work. Those who have travelled to countries where exposure to COVID-19 is elevated may be asked to self-isolate. Niagara Health has also limited the size and number of work gatherings to lessen the risk of disease transmission among staff. People who are sick are being asked not to visit their loved ones in hospital. The measures were put in place to try and prevent a situation similar to one at Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton, where an oncologist who recently travelled to Hawaii tested positive for the virus. Niagara Health is also planning for what Viljoen called ""cascading scenarios"" related to a local COVID-19 outbreak. Like most Ontario hospitals, Niagara's are struggling to keep up with patient demand, where there are sometimes not enough beds for patients, who end up in hallways waiting for space. A full-blown COVID-19 outbreak would put more pressure on an already taxed system. Viljoen said the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization is low, but Niagara Health has to plan for the worst.

To ensure there is enough space, other patients will be transferred to Niagara Falls and Welland hospitals. In the event the number of COVID-19 begins to tax the hospitals, Niagara Health will consider cancelling or deferring elective surgeries and some outpatient services. Whether those measures will need to be enacted will depend entirely on how COVID-19 hits Niagara and how many patients required hospitalization.

In a statement issued late Thursday, Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz said anyone who has received a summons for jury duty for an upcoming trial does not need to attend court. ""The safety of all who use and rely upon the court is essential,"" the statement reads. ""Equally important is continued access to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice should COVID-19 disrupt court operations."" Officials said small claims court cases have also been temporarily halted. Niagara criminal lawyer Bobbie Walker supports the court's decision to temporarily postpone jury trials. ""I think it's positive and proactive to protect the public,"" she said. ""The time to act is now."" ""This is unprecedented, but we're dealing with a situation that's very difficult and evolving."" Walker, the judicial liaison with the Lincoln County Law Association, said the jury selection process is by definition a large public gathering, which is exactly what government officials are encouraging the public to avoid. ""We often have 400 people in one courtroom and the people that are part of the jury pool are of varying ages, including senior citizens."" Personal injury lawyer Christopher Richard, of Graves & Richard in St. Catharines, said the courts had no choice but to temporarily cancel jury panels. ""They (potential jurors) end up sitting in close quarters in a single courtroom for between 60 and 90 minutes. There are people of all age groups, and obviously there are a number of people with significant underlying health conditions."" His office was preparing for a civil jury matter scheduled for the end of March. ""At this point, we don't know how long the delay will be as it will depend on how many matters within our jurisdiction have to be rescheduled,"" he said. Richard predicts the delay could be six to 12 months. Niagara criminal lawyer David Protomanni represents a man who is expected to stand trial before a jury in early May. The trial, which involves a number of defendants, is expected to last six months. ""The primary concern is that this trial needs to be tried within a reasonable time,"" he said. ""If the trial does not begin in May, it could start in June or even July, but any later than that there could be an application by counsel to stay the charge against all the accused."" Protomanni said the justice system had no choice but to shut down jury trials. ""Juries are made of all different walks of life, young and old. It would be a shame for someone to spread this virus because they were ordered to appear before the court."" While jury panels have been cancelled, courts in St. Catharines and Welland remain open.

""It's nuts,"" said Fonthill resident Francien Hiebendaal, as she left the St. Catharines Costco store, Friday morning. She said customers were lined up the entire length of the store, stretching from the checkouts to the butcher's shop. Despite that, she said, crowds were orderly and remained courteous. ""I've never seen it like this. It's always busy, but not like this. This is just nuts."" She said many customers were leaving the business with carts loaded full of toilet paper, until the shop was sold out of the product before 11 a.m. Heath Hudson said he visited Costco to pick-up some dog food but ended up waiting in line for more than 30 minutes to pay for a cart full of supplies. But after seeing the lineup, he said he added to his shopping list - picking up a few additional items for his parents, too, to avoid a return trip to the store. ""My parents are in their 70s and I don't want them waiting around in this,"" he said. Hudson said he's ""not at all"" worried about COVID-19. ""I've been through SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), H1N1, all that,"" he said. ""It's a joke."" Hiebendaal, too, said her visit to Costco was just a weekly trip to restock her empty freezer, but she picked up a few extra items anyway - more concerned about avoiding another long lineup than she is about her risk of infection. ""It's crazier now than at Christmas,"" said Heidy Lis, as she left the store pushing a cart packed with toilet paper. ""It's a complete zoo."" While keeping the customers flowing through the business, Costco staff were also taking precautions to help reduce the spread of the virus. Two staff members were at the entrance, handing out disinfectant wipes to every customer who entered the business. Other major retailers were equally busy, including Walmart stores where toilet paper and hand sanitizer were in short supply. The Walmart on Vansickle Road in St. Catharines, for instance, was sold out of both products Friday morning. Niagara Regional Police reported that although major retailers throughout the region were extremely busy, no disturbances were reported.

Brock is also cancelling events it co-sponsors off campus, including Cuvee and the Brock Sports Athletic Banquet as well as events on campus organized by third parties. In person exams at Brock are cancelled. Professors can skip exams entirely, or do them online or as take-home assignments. However, the school says the academic term is not at risk and staff are working on alternative ways to deliver classes and exams Brock says it plans to resume virtual classes the week of March 23. Niagara College says online courses will remain open and placements and co-ops will continue for the time being. The college has not indicated when it might resume in-class instruction for students. - Western cancels classes until Mar. 18, as students petition Toronto universities amid coronavirus concerns SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

On Thursday, the provincial government ordered all publicly funded schools to be closed for two weeks following March break, with a tentative plan for classes to resume April 6. District School Board of Niagara spokeswoman Kim Yielding said the board is ""pleased"" with the province's decision to temporarily close the schools for the sake of student and staff safety. ""I think it gives parents a big feeling of relief,"" she said Friday. ""There was a lot of anxiety around people coming back from March break."" If COVID-19 worsens in the meantime, the province would have to decide what further measures to take then. ""They will let parents and school boards know what their thoughts are,"" she said, noting the current situation doesn't signal a lost academic year. ""There was no indication from the ministry that the school year is in jeopardy,"" she said. With facilities sitting empty for the next three weeks, DSBN custodial staff won't be getting any time off. ""It's a great opportunity to proactively clean our schools,"" said Yielding, adding janitorial work has already been elevated in recent days. They will ""pull everything apart"" and frequently clean ""high-touch points"" at schools. A teleconference was held late Thursday between the province and directors of education from across Ontario. Niagara Catholic District School Board says it “fully supports” the provincial government’s school closure, in an effort to try to contain the spread of COVID-19 throughout the province. “In the coming week, Niagara Catholic will follow its usual March Break cleaning routine, paying particular attention to touchstone areas and areas that cannot always be easily accessed with staff and students in the school,” reads a statement from the Catholic board. Fort Erie parent Lisa Anderson said cancelling school for two weeks after the break is a ""good idea in theory,"" but wonders what the impact will be. She said there are no guarantees people won't extend their vacations or even book new ones that overlap into the extended time off. ""It's a tough call for sure. Maybe less notice should have been given,"" she said. ""But that would also be extremely unfair and difficult for working parents, who would then have to find last-minute care for their kids,"" she said. The disruption from COVID-19 is one of two reasons students have been kept out of class recently. Most teachers unions remain in contract disputes with the province. Only the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association has reached a tentative agreement with the government. Details are unknown, but OECTA Niagara elementary unit president Marie Balanowski said it's ""encouraging"" to know the end of an ongoing job action that started in late 2019 could be in sight. ""It was remarkable to see educators, parents, students, community members, our NDP MPPs, take a stand against the drastic cuts that the Ford government wanted to make to education,"" she said Friday. Shannon Smith, president of Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation's Niagara unit, said bargaining needs to continue. No dates have been set.

COVID-19 has finally arrived in Niagara. The retirement village upgraded its screening and cleaning protocols Friday morning when its administration was informed that one of its residents, an 84-year-old man, had tested positive for the deadly virus. Anyone visiting the residence has to answer questions about their medical condition and travel history and sanitize their hands. How the man, whose name is not being released and is in stable condition at the St. Catharines hospital, came to be infected is under investigation by the Niagara Public Health department. But it appears he may have contracted it from a family member who recently travelled in Europe. ""Our working hypothesis is that the source of the infection may have been from a family member who was travelling but did not show symptoms immediately upon return to Canada,"" said Niagara's medical officer of health Dr. Mustafa Hirji. ""That family member is now showing mild symptoms so they are being tested."" The man is the first Niagara resident to test positive for the virus. At Ina Grafton, the news was greeted with some surprise, but for a residence used to annual flu outbreaks, coping with COVID-19 was case of stepping up a cleaning protocol that was already active. ""We have 400 residents,"" said Ina Grafton CEO Patrick O'Neill. ""It's flu season, so we were already doubling up cleaning touch points and hallways in the buildings. But I will admit, there is a lot of fear going around about COVID-19, and it can be a little creepy."" He said the resident's room has been cleaned several times, and the residence provided public health with a list of the patient's neighbours and people he was in contact with. In a Friday interview, Hirji said public health is in the process of reaching out to people the patient came into contact with. If necessary some of those people could be placed in isolation or tested for the virus. But as of Friday those steps were not yet necessary. However, the paramedics who took the man to hospital as well as some health care workers have been put in isolation for 14 days. The man was taken to hospital on March 10 for an unrelated medical issue. At the St. Catharines hospital, it was discovered he met the criteria for COVID-19 testing. The health care professionals who cared for the patient prior to the COVID-19 test are being isolated as a precaution, Hirji said. However, those health care workers are not being tested yet. ""You cannot really test if a person is not showing symptoms,"" Hirji said. ""If you test right away without symptoms and it comes back negative, that negative test may not mean anything. You really have to wait until you see the symptoms."" ""Despite Niagara having its first case, there continues to be no evidence of local circulation of the virus in Niagara or Ontario,"" Hirji said in a statement. ""The risk to Niagara residents therefore remains low."" The positive result comes on the heels of local health officials taking proactive steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the event of a local outbreak. Niagara Health, which does all local testing for COVID-19 and test patients, is establishing assessment centres in St. Catharines and Niagara Falls to screen and test potential patients at locations away from hospitals. That's being done in a bid to reduce the possible spread of the virus. However, given the positive test, Niagara Health is stepping up its screening protocols. By Monday some St. Catharines hospital entrances will be closed and patients and visitors will be directed to specific entrances where they will be asked about their medical status and travel history - the basic elements of widely used COVID-19 screening. On Wednesday, Niagara Health chief of staff Dr. Johan Viljoen said the St. Catharines hospital will be the treatment centre for all local COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization. The Niagara case was one of a rash of new infections confirmed by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care Friday morning. The ministry says there are now 74 cases in Ontario, up from 54 Thursday. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Medical masks, including the N-95 mask, will not protect you from COVID-19, he says. He also says while hand sanitizers are a good idea, hoarding toilet paper and other household supplies won't keep anyone safe. Other basic precautions, including coughing or sneezing in your sleeve, not touching your face and staying home when sick are also important, Hirji says. What to do if you think you have COVID -19 Health workers will test someone for COVID-19 if they meet two criteria: a person is showing respiratory symptoms similar to cold or flu and they have travelled to somewhere where they may have been exposed, like China or Europe, or have been in contact with someone who has. Hirji says if you meet those criteria, call your health care provider before showing up so they can make appropriate arrangements to have you screened and, if necessary, tested.

Across St. Paul Street, at Kully's Original Sports Bar, manager Ryan Young chatted with one of his staff. Their tables were mostly empty. too. The first day of March break should be a busy time in downtown St. Catharines but it wasn't, thanks to the COVID-19 virus. ""Everyone is worried,"" said Wojnowski, who closed a second outlet, near Brock University, an hour after the school announced Friday in-person classes were cancelled and all teaching would be done online. ""We all have rent to pay, these kids are looking for hours. They have rent to pay and bills to pay . everybody is afraid."" The next few days are going to be ""crucial,"" he said: ""Hopefully this blows over quick."" With public health officials warning people to avoid large crowds where germs can be spread, businesses everywhere are being affected. In downtown St. Catharines, cancellation of events at Meridian Centre, FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre and Market Square have added to the pain. At Kully's, Young said he can screen eight different sporting events simultaneously on his wall-mounted TVs. But all the major sports leagues have shut down, too. ""It's hard trying to run a sports bar with no sports,"" he said. His place has seen only a small drop-off in business so far, but he said ""it's going to be tough"" without the arena or live theatre to bring people downtown. ""When there's events at both places, we'd be filled,"" he said. ""We have good pre-crowd and post-crowd. But more important, it's just sports in general, whether there are events there or not."" In an interview Saturday, Niagara's acting medical officer of health Dr. Mustafa Hirji said people should remember that ""right now, the risk in Niagara is low."" ""People should not be afraid of frequenting those businesses and partaking in them, and of continuing to enjoy the social life we enjoy in Niagara."" At Kully's, Young said he emailed city hall Friday hoping it could do something to provide relief to downtown businesses. He and Wojnowski suggest possibly offering free on-street parking, like at Christmas time. St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik said the city's emergency operation centre committee will meet Monday to consider options for ""how do we support businesses in our community."" He said municipalities across Ontario are wrestling with the same issue, trying to come to grips with the sudden impact COVID-19 has had on communities. While urging people to continue supporting local restaurants and businesses, he said it's important those places communicate to customers the steps they are taking to keep their environments safe. On Garden Park, just off St. Paul Street, Fulton Fitness shut down for the weekend over the coronavirus. Owner John Fulton, who has operated the gym since 1982, said he had been tracking the progress of COVID-19 since it was detected in China in January. ""I said, first case I'm closing,"" he said Saturday, a day after Niagara's first case was confirmed. It's just a 48-hour closing but that could be extended, he said. He blames governments for being unprepared for what he believes they should have planned for. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Whether it was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau going into self-quarantine or word that actor Tom Hanks and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 he's not sure, but it seemed to have been a ""tipping point"" for people. ""There's a few hardy souls out there that are still coming in, but usually Saturday is our busiest morning of the week,"" Lowes said. ""We have two people on, and they're basically just cleaning . we only have about eight people in the caf� right now"" when there would normally be 50 or 60. They have stepped up cleaning procedures, and their utensils are compostable and aren't being reused. He expects to have to reduce the caf�'s hours, and like Wojnowski and Young he said the next week will be critical. ""It's all been super-fast,"" Lowes said.

On Sunday afternoon, Diodati said he hadn't received any further information about results. ""They believe it's unlikely that I have it, but this was out of precautionary measures that I had it done,"" said Diodati, adding he's been sick with flu-like symptoms since last Sunday. He said he has been on antibiotics since Monday, as it was first diagnosed as strep throat. When he wasn't getting better, he got tested by Niagara Region Public Health. He said his first symptom was a sore throat, which led to an earache, sneezing and coughing. ""I've had strep, it sure seemed like strep, but then usually within 48 hours of taking antibiotics you start to feel noticeably better. Well, that didn't happen."" Diodati said he spoke with Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara's acting medical officer of health, a public health nurse and an infectious disease doctor. ""They believe it's unlikely (I have COVID-19), but just because I talk to so many people, thousands and thousands, I said I just think it would be irresponsible not to at least get checked because I'm sick and I've been sick since after my trip to Washington, D.C., last week."" Diodati travelled to Washington as part of a binational delegation to discuss issues related to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence waterways. He returned Thursday and started to feel ill three days later. Diodati said he met with and saw ""dozens of senators and congressional leaders, and then I was hearing (Thursday) that some of them have been exposed to people that have had the coronavirus."" St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik, who was also in Washington with Diodati, said he feels ""fine."" Sendzik said he and Diodati flew on different planes. He said nobody was shaking hands or getting close among the politicians they talked to. ""The social distancing was already in place by the time we got to Washington.""

Niagara Region Public Health said the patient, a 55-year-old woman, had recently returned from Egypt. A family member who lives with her is also isolated at home and being monitored for symptoms, said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, the Niagara's acting medical officer of health. That follows the region's first case, diagnosed Friday, involving an 84-year-old resident of Ina Grafton Gage Village retirement home in St. Catharines. That person had been in contact with someone who had recently returned from Portugal. ""I think it seems a scary time with all these announcements of new cases coming out, but we're not seeing local circulation of virus in Niagara,"" said Hirji. With the provincial and federal governments strongly urging people to avoid non-essential travel, and Canadians returning home from abroad, he said it's not surprising to see more travel-related cases. What is significant, Hirji said, is there has been no transmission of COVID-19 within the community. ""I think people should feel safe going about their regular activities at this time"" while taking preventative steps such as frequent hand washing, covering coughs and avoiding large crowds. ""We are expecting that given how many cases we are seeing around the world, people travelling to Canada and returning to Canada are possibly going to be carrying this back with them,"" he said. ""The key for me is that the cases continue to be linked to travel, which is what we expect. ""We're not seeing circulation locally among the population in Niagara, or really in Ontario as a whole, and that means our risk remains low."" In the most recent case, he said, the important thing is the woman took the right steps to get medical attention. ""When they started to develop symptoms, they took our advice and called their health-care provider to let them know,"" he said. ""We were able to make sure this person was scheduled (to arrive at hospital) for a certain time to go have their test done. ""They wore a mask when they went to the hospital to have their sample taken, they got the sample taken and left, and no health-care workers were exposed. Nobody else in the hospital who happened to be there was exposed."" Anyone who suspects they might have COVID-19 is advised to phone emergency services at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 to get instructions on what to do. In the case of the first diagnosis, involving the Ina Grafton Gage resident, the infected senior remains in hospital in stable condition. Three paramedics, as well as any hospital staff who were in contact with the person, are self-isolating. A COVID-19 test, done by swabbing the back of the nose, would be done if a person shows symptoms: sore throat, a dry cough, shortness of breath and fever. ""If you do a test right after someone has been exposed, it will almost certainly come back as negative. And then you're getting a false negative, which is misleading,"" said Hirji. ""We need to wait for people to develop symptoms and at that point we test."" Municipalities across Niagara have taken steps to lessen the chance of COVID-19 spreading, including closing public centres including museums, libraries, theatres and arenas. Balancing the need to control COVID-19 against the importance of people continuing as much of a normal life as possible and supporting local businesses, is ""a judgment call,"" Hirji said. ""We have to accept some level of risk, and I think that's where we are in Ontario,"" he said. ""We're trying to find where that appropriate balance is.""

At this point, he said, the single-most important thing is for people to avoid non-essential travel, even short trips over the border to Buffalo or Niagara Falls, N.Y. As of Sunday morning, the provincial government reported 137 confirmed cases across Ontario, up from 96 on Saturday. As well, there were 1,316 cases under investigation; on Saturday, there were 939.

People can take GO Bus Route 12 service to Niagara Falls, which connects to GO train service at Burlington GO. In a statement, Metrolinx said they are taking the ""unprecedented"" step of temporarily reducing GO Transit and UP Express services to protect Ontarians from COVID-19. The changes begin Wednesday. There is no timeline for when service will return to normal. ""We will take around 30 per cent of our trains off the network, but we will still serve all of the routes we serve today,"" said Metrolinx president and chief executive officer Phil Verster. ""During the peak hours, we'll typically run a 30-minute service with more trains on Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West and in the off peak, we will run around an hourly service, but still a 30-minute service on the two Lakeshore lines. On Up Express, we'll typically run a 30-minute service."" New temporary train times can be found at https://www.gotransit.com/en/trip-planning/go-service-updates/train-schedule-changes. To find your GO bus schedule, visit https://www.gotransit.com/en/trip-planning/go-service-updates/bus-schedule-changes. ""Our key consideration is ensuring our services can continue and our employees and customers are safe,"" said Verster. ""We want to ensure there is a reliable and sustainable plan for service to continue over the weeks to come. GO and UP Express are vital to our region. Every route we serve, we will continue to serve."" Metrolinx said the reduction in services are expected to be in line with the expected reduction in ridership due to March break, school closures and the significant shift in many organizations' work-from-home policy. ""Our customers will still get the same safe experience, our transit-safety and customer-service teams will continue to be available to help customers get where they need to go,"" said Verster. ""Our teams will also maintain the increased level of cleaning on our vehicles and stations."" Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Donations of food will still be accepted at the back door. Meanwhile, Great Wolf Lodge is temporarily closing. ""We have had no reported positive COVID-19 cases within our guest or pack community. However, with the recent focus from federal and state government officials on restricting large gatherings, we believe it is in the best interest of our guests and pack members to temporarily close all of our resorts and plan to re-open on April 2,"" said a company statement. The closure of the Niagara Falls resort took affect Sunday afternoon. "" For all guests with reservations from the evening of March 15 through April 1, we will automatically cancel your reservation and provide a full refund.""

""Hornblower Niagara Cruises supports the government of Ontario's priority on ensuring the health of Ontarians and visitors to the province. We will continue to monitor ongoing events and undertake the precautions and best practices recommended by public health experts and will be providing updates as the situation with COVID-19 evolves."" Hornblower will contact guests who have booked tickets to arrange for refunds or adjust their cruise tickets to a later date. Niagara Parks announced it would be closing all its public-facing operations, with a tentative plan to resume operations April 6. ""While we know that many families had planned on visiting Niagara Parks over the March break, the health and safety of our guests and our staff must come first,"" said Niagara Parks chair Sandie Bellows. The closure extends to Niagara Parks attractions, restaurants, retail stores and golf courses, as well as the Wego green line bus service and Falls Incline Railway.

Until at least April, individuals with family, criminal or Provincial Offences Act appearances do not need to attend court unless the matter is an in-custody or urgent matter. In Ontario Court of Justice in St. Catharines Monday, two of four criminal courts were in session, as well as bail court. ""Anything that is non-essential is to be adjourned 10 weeks at a time,"" Judge Donald Wolfe told defence lawyers in his courtroom. Niagara defence lawyer Jeffrey Root on Monday represented a 57-year-old Niagara Falls woman who assaulted her former partner. Root said he ""understands the calamity our society is in,"" before requesting his case be dealt with as his client suffers from anxiety and was eager to put the matter behind her. Another case involved a woman who pleaded guilty to driving with an excessive blood/alcohol level. In that matter, the woman needed to plead guilty within 90 days of the offence in order to qualify for a reduced driving suspension under the Ignition Interlock System program. Other cases were adjourned, most until May. Meanwhile, according to the OCJ, urgent family matters, such as hearings under the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, will proceed on a prioritized basis. When possible, the family court matters will be conducted by telephone or video conferencing. Non-urgent family court matters will be adjourned eight to 12 weeks. In a statement released Sunday, the OCJ said it is committed to ensuring people with urgent matters continue to have access to the court, while also reducing the amount of time individuals spend in courtrooms. Public health officials have recommended measures be taken to reduce time individuals spend in large crowds or in crowded spaces to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Ontario Superior Court, which deals with all civil, some family and the most serious criminal matters, announced last week it was suspending upcoming criminal and civil jury trials. Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz said in a statement that anyone who has received a summons for jury duty for an upcoming trial does not need to attend court. ""The safety of all who use and rely upon the court is essential,"" the statement read. ""Equally important is continued access to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice should COVID-19 disrupt court operations."" Niagara criminal lawyer Bobbie Walker supported the SCJ decision. ""This is unprecedented, but we're dealing with a situation that's very difficult and evolving,"" she said Friday. Walker said the jury selection process is by definition a large public gathering, which is exactly what government officials are encouraging the public to avoid. ""We often have 400 people in one courtroom and the people that are part of the jury pool are of varying ages, including senior citizens."" Personal injury lawyer Christopher Richard, of Graves & Richard in St. Catharines, said the courts had no choice but to temporarily cancel jury panels. ""They (potential jurors) end up sitting in close quarters in a single courtroom for between 60 and 90 minutes. There are people of all age groups, and obviously there are a number of people with significant underlying health conditions."" His office was preparing for a civil jury matter scheduled for the end of March. ""At this point, we don't know how long the delay will be as it will depend on how many matters within our jurisdiction have to be rescheduled,"" he said. Richard predicted the delay could be six to 12 months. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The trial, which involves a number of defendants, is expected to last six months. ""The primary concern is that this trial needs to be tried within a reasonable time,"" he said. ""If the trial does not begin in May, it could start in June or even July, but any later than that there could be an application by counsel to stay the charge against all the accused."" On Sunday, the SCJ updated its statement, saying court will almost completely shut down until further notice as of Tuesday, but will continue to hear urgent matters. It's expected the cases will mainly be dealt with in writing or by teleconference. Small claims court cases have also been temporarily halted. Court officials are urging the public not to attend a courthouse if they have been advised by health officials to self-isolate due to possible exposure to the deadly virus. The Ministry of the Attorney General continues to monitor the evolving situation of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Ontario takes the health and safety of staff and court users very seriously,"" said Brian Gray, ministry spokesperson. ""We are following protocols to help protect the health of staff and all who use our courthouses by keeping them informed of hygiene protocols and the public health guidance related to travel from COVID-19 impacted areas."" Meanwhile, Niagara Detention Centre has suspended visits to the Thorold facility. Professional visits, including with legal counsel, will continue. To reduce the possible transmission of the virus, inmates serving intermittent sentences — who typically serve on weekends — are now required to attend the jail to report, but are then permitted to return home. The same directives apply at all Ontario adult correctional facilities. - Thorold jail a 'petri dish cesspool,' lawyer tells court as pandemic fears spread - Jury trials suspended over COVID-19 concerns SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara's acting medical officer of health, said the man self-reported symptoms after his journey to the United Kingdom, France, The Netherlands and Switzerland. ""What this person did is after arriving home from their flight, on a future date they started to develop symptoms, were very mindful of the guidance that if you develop symptoms after you travel internationally you should call your health-care provider,"" Hirji said. ""And so they did the right thing and called their health-care provider. Given the travel history symptoms, a decision was made that it made sense to test this person. And so arrangements were made for that person to have a scheduled time to go in for testing, went in wearing a mask, got tested, left no exposures there for any health-care provider or EMS."" The patient is self-isolated in his home, and since self-reporting has only been in contact with family members who, Hirji said, are not being isolated themselves. Hirji said self-isolating is more than just staying at home, particularly if a person doesn't live alone. ""We want to keep physical separation as much as possible. If you can have them stay in the one room of the house where nobody else goes in, that's recommended. If there's the option for you to have a separate bathroom for that person, that's great because the bathroom is a place where things can often get contaminated if someone is brushing their teeth, etc.,"" Hirji said. ""If that person does need to leave the room where they're isolating themselves, we recommend that they wear a mask so that if they do cough they don't spread that around to others."" Hirji said if a person is isolated at home with other people, everyone in the house must be very vigilant about hand washing and cleaning. Hirji said Niagara's third case is similar to its second — a 55-year-old woman who had been to Egypt — in that the person self-reported her illness. Her positive test was confirmed Sunday. A family member of the woman is in isolation. Mustafa said Niagara's third patient is not the same person who public health authorities believe may have infected the region's first COVID-19 case — an 84-year-old resident of Ina Grafton Gage Village. That person, whose positive test was confirmed late Thursday night, appears to have been infected by a family member who had recently been to Europe. That patient is being treated at St. Catharines hospital and his family member is in isolation awaiting the results of a test. Hirji said the recent upswing in COVID-19 testing in Ontario — there have been more than 8,400 people tested in the province — means it is taking a little longer for results to come back. Hirji said in Niagara there isn't evidence of community-level transmission of COVID-19. All three confirmed cases are travel-related. He said because the risk of community transmission is low, Niagara residents can go about their daily routines — but while being mindful of measures to stay safe and limit the spread of the virus: hand-washing, staying home if sick, coughing into your sleeve and not touching your face. Hirji also said people should not attend large gatherings and practice social distancing. - Niagara hospitals postpone non-urgent procedures Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

All public consultations, including information centres and surveys, are on hold until further notice to limit public access to regional headquarters. ""We are doing everything we can to ensure anything that can be done electronically is done, whether it is by telephone or email or text message,"" Region Chair Jim Bradley said. A media release from the Region said staff will focus on delivering essential services while supporting the direction from federal and provincial governments to limit contact. The directive includes reminders that social distancing helps reduce the spread of the virus. In its daily update, the Ontario Ministry of Health said Tuesday there were no new COVID-19 cases in Niagara. The region has three confirmed. All are travel related. The province declared a state of emergency Tuesday morning and ordered the closure of public libraries, private schools, private day-cares, facilities that offer indoor recreational programs, theatres as well as bars and restaurants, with exceptions for takeout food and delivery menu items. Asked who might enforce the ban if it comes to that, Bradley said it would likely be public health or police, depending on the situation. ""I think there is a clear indication that people are going to comply,"" Bradley said. ""Some businesses were already limiting service to take out and delivery before the premier made his announcement. They decided on their own that the seating arrangements made it impossible to keep the necessary social distance. ""Intuitively we might have thought there would have been an uproar from businesses. It would have been understandable. ""Overwhelming they understand the seriousness of the situation. Looking at what is happening internationally and what they officials are saying federally, provincially and locally, they realize having restaurants and bars open is just not in the books."" The state of emergency declaration doesn't extend to public transit, shopping malls, grocery stores, pharmacies, businesses, factories and construction sites. ""Some of us already avoid contact during the flu season,"" Bradley said. ""Public health is always telling us to avoid handshakes, but we are at meetings all the time, and we are always greeting people. Before this crisis arose, I was already giving a nod instead of a handshake. ""It is interesting what is happening now. We see that hand go out, and then get pulled back. We are getting waves and elbow bumps. It's probably the healthiest thing to do, even if it is a hard habit to break."" In the latest development Tuesday, the Region closed all of its Ontario Works offices - St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Welland, Port Colborne and Fort Erie. Caseworkers are available by phone. New applicants are being directed to the Region website and its Ontario Works page, where they can apply for social assistance online. The Region had already closed its child-care sites in schools until April 5 and restricted visiting access to in long-term care facilities until further notice. There is an exception people visiting residents who are considered ""end of life."" Cancelled until further notices are Region clinics and classes, which include prenatal classes and food-handler certification. There is a list of cancellations available at niagararegion.ca/service-disruptions/default.aspx. The Region has a COVID-19 info-line (905-688-8248 ext. 7019; toll-free 1-888-505-6074) with nurses answering seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. William.Sawchuk@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1630 | @bill_standard - Niagara Region to hold special COVID-19 meeting Wednesday Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Bill George, chair of Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, said limiting foreign visitors to the country during the pandemic is also cutting off farms from a vital supply of migrant workers. Without those workers, Ontario growers can't produce food, he said. ""If we sort this out over the next day or so, we should be all right,"" said George in an interview Tuesday. ""But if this stretches on for two or three weeks, then it will be a serious problem and crops simply won't be planted."" Ottawa has closed the Canadian border to anyone except Canadian citizens, permanent residents and U.S. citizens in a bid to slow the transmission of the virus. That lockdown means some 13,000 workers — largely from Central America — expected to arrive at Ontario farms in the coming weeks and months won't be able to get into the country. George said some 8,000 workers are already here and waves of the other 13,000 were set to start in the next few weeks. These workers, usually experienced agricultural workers, plant and tend crops in vineyards, greenhouses and farms. They have been a linchpin in Ontario agriculture for decades and there is no domestic workforce that can replace them, said George. ""Without them, you will see a real impact on Ontario-grown fruits and vegetables,"" he said. ""This impacts our food security. We don't want to be entirely dependent on other countries which, frankly, are dealing with the same issues."" He said his association and others have been talking to Ottawa for the past few days to try to find a solution. ""We understand there is a public health issue here that is serious. At the same time, we are talking about Canada's food supply,"" he said. ""So perhaps there can be some system set up to screen workers. We're still talking with the federal government about it."" St. Catharines Liberal MP Chris Bittle said the issue is now ""central"" to discussions in Ottawa about how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. A solution, he said, will not be simple. In addition to determining how to manage a screening protocol for incoming workers at a time when testing swabs are being rationed, there needs to be a way to keep farms and workers safe once they're here. The living quarters for many migrant workers are not ideal for the kind of social distancing health-care experts are saying is vital to limiting the spread of the virus. ""If COVID-19 were to hit the farm workers, would it be able to spread quickly?"" Bittle said. Bittle said the initial decision to bar travellers from Canada due to the pandemic was a necessary and immediate step the federal government had to take. Now it has to figure out how to help Canadian farms. George said a decision has to be made quickly because farmers don't have the luxury of time. ""Like we have told the government, we are not like factories. We cannot just switch it off and then turn it on again later,"" George said. ""There are specific deadlines and timetables we have to hit, and if we don't, we cannot plant crops.""

Niagara Region's health united confirmed Wednesday evening that a 58-year-old man who recently travelled to Europe is the region's latest novel coronavirus case, and are investigating whether or not anyone else was exposed through contact with him. On Friday, the public health department and the provincial Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care announced Niagara's first case of the sometimes deadly virial infection — an 84-year-old resident of Ina Grafton Gage Village in St. Catharines. He is being treated at St. Catharines hospital. At the time, the health department suspected the man acquired the infection from a family member who had travelled to Europe. That family member was tested for COVID-19 and isolated. According to the public health department, the 58-year-old only experienced very mild symptoms for a single day, and did not suspect he had a COVID-19 infection. As a result, public health is trying to identify any additional infections linked this person. ""Discovery of this case is an illustration of how intense public health investigations are preventing local transmission of COVID-19 in Niagara,"" said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara's acting medical officer of health, in a statement released Wednesday. ""While there continues to be no evidence of local circulation of COVID-19, we are working determinedly with our health-care partners to prepare for when that changes."" The health department said the 58-year-old man has fully recovered, but remains in isolation awaiting lab results that confirms he is no long carrying the virus. A person is not cleared until two test results show they are no longer infected. Niagara's second case of COVID-19 infection was confirmed Sunday to be a 55-year-old woman who had travelled to Egypt. She and a family member are in isolation. The third case was confirmed Monday as a 47-year-old man who acquired the virus while on a business trip through Europe. He is recovering at home in isolation. His family is also in isolation, although none of them are ill.

The issue is the safety of drivers. Graham Morrison, general manager of the St. Catharines Transit Commission, said riders are being asked to board buses through the rear doors to protect drivers. The result is that customers can't have interaction with the fare box. He said the move allows transit to obey social distancing protocols while still providing service to people who need to use the bus to get to and from work. St. Catharines Transit has seen an 80 per cent drop in ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. The weekday service is operating on a modified schedule similar to the Saturday schedule.

Officers are following medical direction and taking extra precautions on patrol and additional cleaning protocols are in place across the service. Meanwhile, the fraud squad warned of scammers trying to cash in on people's coronavirus fears. It's all part of what Chief Bryan MacCulloch calls ""unprecedented"" circumstances for police as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the province. MacCulloch started last week by hosting a virtual town hall-style meeting on the crisis for uniform and civilian members of the service, which number more than 1,000. ""We recognize that this has impacted the entire community, and it's more important than ever to ensure our members are informed of any changes that are being implemented in response to COVID-19,"" MacCulloch said. ""At the same time, the service remains operational and dealing with numerous other functions and investigations that are unrelated to COVID-19 in the continued service of our community."" It is a fluid situation. About a week ago, the NRP began asking the public to consider the online alternative for everything from reporting crime to obtaining record checks and copies of reports, all in the name of combating the virus. By Tuesday morning, the provincial government had declared a state of emergency. Wednesday, police asked the public to only attend district offices and headquarters in emergencies. Thursday, MacCulloch closed district offices in Grimsby, Port Colborne and Fort Erie to the public, leaving district headquarters in St. Catharines, Welland and Niagara Falls open for counter service - in emergencies. ""The community has been very responsive and understanding of the need to suspend in-person requests for these services at this time,"" MacCulloch said. ""We are aware that some services such as fingerprinting may be required to allow a health-care worker to complete a background check. We are working to ensure those urgent requests are accommodated via appointment to manage the potential exposure to our members."" The concern for law enforcement officials is the impact on public safety if their personnel begin falling ill in significant enough numbers to strain resources. MacCulloch said officers are being directed to make sure they have their personal protective equipment on them at all times and are being reminded of the importance of proper hygiene and social distancing where possible. The communications unit is also doing its part by asking questions to screen complainants if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, so officers know what they are facing and can take appropriate precautionary measures, where appropriate, to ensure their safety. ""I'm extremely proud of our members, both sworn and civilian, who continue to serve and protect the residents of Niagara,"" MacCulloch said.

But the reality of COVID-19 is anything but ideal, and while the novel coronavirus is at the top of the Niagara health department's agenda, it is not the only disease it has to manage. ""There are a number of important programs that we have to, in as much as possible, keep working, like our vaccination programs,"" said Dr. Musftafa Hirji, the region's acting medical officer of health. ""The last thing we want during a COVID-19 pandemic is a measles outbreak."" Hirji said the scope of the current crisis is consuming much of the public health department's resources. Its COVID-19 hotline now takes some 900 calls a day, with another 300 people reaching out online through live chats. Staff have been redeployed to deal with the call volume and some retirees have returned to work to help out. Some programs have been effectively suspended while others are operating with vastly limited resources. ""Much of the work in those programs has been reduced,"" he said. ""But despite the pandemic, we have to keep them going if we can."" This includes support for pregnant woman, new mothers and dental care programs, he said, as these are programs that elevate the general health of the community. The department's vaccination program has not just been impacted by redeployment of staff but by the closure of schools, where public health has vaccination clinics. There have been localized outbreaks in the past few years of diseases such as whooping cough in some communities where ""herd immunity"" — a situation through which most people are immunized against a disease, which prevents it from spreading — was lost due to low vaccination rates. An outbreak of whooping cough or measles during the pandemic would be devastating. As new COVID-19 cases are confirmed, the health department is called upon to investigate where and potentially from whom a patient contracted the virus. It is a labour-intensive process that, so far, the health department has only had to do a few times in a region with only four confirmed cases. Those investigations revealed Niagara's first and fourth cases were linked. The first case, an 84-year-old resident of Ina Grafton Gage in St. Catharines, was the result of him coming into contact with a family member who had been to Europe. The 84-year-old is being treated at the St. Catharines hospital, and his family member, a 58-year-old man, the fourth case, is in isolation. The health department is tracking down anyone else who came into contact with the 58-year-old. The second case was a 55-year-old woman who had been to Egypt. She and a family member are in isolation. And the third case is a 47-year-old who contracted the virus while on a business trip to Europe. He is in isolation with his family. There were no new confirmed cases announced Monday. Niagara's two COVID-19 assessment centres, near St. Catharines hospital and Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, saw 156 patients Monday, down from 226 who arrived the day before. Patients can only go to the centres upon referral by the public health department. Once there, patients are screened and, if necessary, tested for COVID-19. They may be sent home to be isolated for 14 days. Those who are very ill may be sent to the emergency department or admitted to hospital. Hirji said the health department is using available data to get a picture of COVID-19 in Niagara, but the way in which the Ontario government is releasing information about new cases is making that difficult. Each day the government posts a list of new cases that includes the age and sex of the patient, along with in what municipality they live and how they contracted the virus. Over the past few days, those updates have included a long list of patients whose information is listed only as ""pending."" However, those cases are not publicly updated as the next day's list only includes newly confirmed cases. Presently the Ontario government does not publish any of its previous case information. ""I am a little dumbfounded by it. If they know a case is confirmed, surely they can include that kind of information,"" Hirji said. ""Usually we are told shortly before the list goes up if we have a new case, and we have not been informed that is the case, so I can assume at the moment that none of those pending cases are in Niagara.""

However, Hirji does not expect that to last. Given the trends across the province, he said it is only a matter of time — perhaps only days — before a verified case of community transmission is found. That is why, he said, it is vital the public take safety precautions, including hand hygiene and social distancing measures, seriously.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty.

It started with Marriott Fallsview Hotel on Fallsview Boulevard Friday night, illuminating 16 hotel rooms in the shape of a heart. By Sunday night, about seven neighbouring properties joined in, beaming glowing hearts across the Niagara River. Twitter lit up with photos of the skyline, prompting CNN to do a story on the city's ""heart of hope"" posted on its website Sunday night. Niagara Falls Tourism chairwoman Janice Thomson said it's an inspiring sight during an unsettling time. ""It's critical, it's a very emotional time obviously,"" she said. ""We need to demonstrate that for Niagara Falls, the No. 1 priority is public safety and public health. ""We want to give that message of compassion and concern."" Marriott Fallsview spokeswoman Sarah Vazquez said staff came up with the idea for the heart logo Friday night after ""a very trying week due to layoffs and closures in the Niagara hospitality sector."" Other hotels were invited to join in, creating a skyline soon seen around the world. Vazquez said it hasn't been determined how long the lights will stay on. During the March break, the city's normally bustling tourism district was virtually empty with the closing of all restaurants, attractions and casinos after Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency for Ontario. But the hotel lights show the city has not gone completely dark. The Embassy Suites also had the word ""Hope"" descending down one side of the building. Among people sharing photos on Twitter over the weekend was Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati. ""This is a message that we're all in this together, a message of solidarity,"" he said. ""It's a message that even when bad things happen, good things can come of them."" Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

""I work with a lot of these vulnerable people and we want to make sure that they're taken care of right now,"" she said. ""We're not doing enough as a country, as a province, as a community, we're absolutely not doing enough. In the meantime, it's up to our community to take care of each other. It's unfortunate that that needs to happen."" And with no time to wait, Elizabeth teamed up with other health-care workers and members of the community to take action, launching an initiative called CareMongering-Niagara, Ontario: Niagara Community Response to COVID-19 to empower neighbours to help one another. Group member Thomas McAllister-Dorricott said Elizabeth and other health-care workers who started the initiative quickly realized ""just how severe the crisis was."" He said the most vulnerable people in the population ""are going to be the ones who are most impacted by this . and we need to as a community to connect with each other as well as our existing resources together to make sure we can weather the storm."" ""In action, taking a backseat role and letting it play out, is insufficient,"" he added. ""We as community members need to be taking an active role in the decision making and networking to address this issue."" Friday, McAllister-Dorricott joined Elizabeth and other team members visiting Thorold neighbourhoods to leave flyers in mailboxes of homes to offer their services to help people in need. Elizabeth stressed the urgency of spreading the word about their efforts. ""We're trying to get these flyers out while we still have time because every day something else is changing,"" she said. The flyers said: ""If you're struggling or concerned about your health, we are here for you. ""If you need any assistance with errands, childcare or supplies, please don't hesitate to reach out. We have built a network of people who can help grab your groceries, prescriptions and other essentials. We want you to stay healthy."" McAllister-Dorricott said those flyers have been translated into several different languages. The flyers also invite people to join a Facebook group or email the organization members at caremongeringniagara@gmail.com. As of Monday morning, more than 3,800 people had joined the Facebook group. ""We're still growing, and we're still doing community outreach while we're still able to,"" McAllister-Dorricott said. ""We're starting to get people offering donations of resources or services that they can provide, as well as people reaching out for demands. It's really truly an intercultural, interfaith organization which is bringing together all the members of our community to address this issue."" He said the success of the program is ""evidence that digital democracy - people in the community using the internet to have democratic action - is the future."" ""This is what is going to work. This is effective. We're helping people. We're connecting with each other through social media,"" he said - adding the resource that is often misused can also be ""a tool that the community can use to help uplift itself."" Members of the CareMongering group are also members of the community, McAllister-Dorricott said.

But the owner of Old Niagara Bookshop has never seen anything like this. ""This is the worst,"" she said. ""I've never ever in my 50 years that I've been here seen anything like this."" MacFadden relies on customer traffic from other neighbouring shops and attractions, such as the theatre and restaurants. But those businesses are essentially shut down, too. It's typically a slow time of the year, but this year it has been extreme as fears of the pandemic have kept tourists at bay. During the weekend, for instance, she said ""at the most we had two people here."" ""It's not an issue for me, except that I'm out of revenue and it's my slow season anyway,"" MacFadden added. The provincial government provided a long list of 74 business types that are deemed essential and permitted to remain open during the pandemic. In addition to grocery stores and pharmacies, the list includes beer and liquor stores, cannabis shops, real estate agents, taxis companies and hardware stores. While announcing the closures, the province encouraged non-essential business owners to find alternative ways to keep their staff employed and business operations continuing. Bookstores, hairdressers and musical instrument shops are non-essential. MacFadden is continuing to work. ""I have the lights on, but the store's closed,"" she said. She plans to be there most days working inside, while watching for the few customers who may peek through the windows of her Regent Street shop. ""If someone calls and they want to pick up an order, I can give it to them outside,"" she said. ""You have to be innovative, but you have to be positive, too. You have to look to when things do open up."" In Welland, Bob Nitransky said the pandemic has kept customers from venturing from their homes and visiting his family's music store. ""It's crazy times,"" he said. While Nitransky shares concerns about COVID-19, he doubts closing Central Music will have much of an impact on reducing the spread of the virus.

For now, Nitransky is focusing on online sales to make it through the shutdown that's expected to last at least two weeks. ""We have to or else we won't be in business,"" he said. ""Obviously, people are at home shopping online, not in our store."" Building Industry and Land Development Association said the decision to deem construction sites as essential workplaces reflects a balance between health and safety and the housing needs in Ontario. In a media release, the Toronto-based organization's president, David Wilkes, said the health and well-being of workers, suppliers and clients remains a top concern for the industry. ""The industry has taken proactive steps such as reducing staff to a bare minimum, practising social distancing for inside work, prioritizing outside work where trades are not in close proximity with each other and increasing on-site sanitation and sanitation facilities,"" he said.

First, it cost the agency more than $50,000 in vital funding by forcing suspension of its annual April daffodil pin door-to-door fundraising campaign. ""All the volunteers were ready to go, the books had been delivered to the team captains to give to their canvassers,"" said senior manager Sharon Burns. ""We had all the venues approved, the grocery stores. We had people signing up online. We had things pretty much set to go."" Then concern for drivers' safety led to the temporary stoppage of the Wheels of Hope program that provides people with cancer free rides to treatment at hospitals between Niagara and Toronto. ""It could be (a hardship for some people),"" said Burns. ""Hopefully they have loved ones or people who can take them to their treatment. ""We have a fair number of volunteer drivers, though, and we have to think of their well-being right now."" There was already a scare earlier this month after a doctor at Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton was a confirmed COVID-19 case. ""We're only one of many, many organizations that are in a similar situation,"" Burns said of the impact on the cancer society's services. As well as the ride program, it has also suspended other services including its wig-lending library for people undergoing chemotherapy and the St. Catharines office is closed to the public. During the outbreak, staff are working from home. Service is still available by phoning 905-684-6455 or 1-888-939-3333. Burns said in addition to the roughly $55,000 the daffodil pin campaign was expected to bring in, other independent fundraisers people stage to help at the same time have also been put off. That will likely cost the Niagara office several thousand more dollars. It has suspended all offline and personal fundraising until April 30, for now. She stressed no services will be cut, even with the fundraising lost during the outbreak. Also, donations can still be made at Cancer.ca. ""Once things get back to normal we will continue with our transportation service, our outreach service, regardless because it's a commitment we've made to our communities,"" she said. ""Hopefully over time we will be able to get that back."" Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

As regional programs and facilities have been shut down to contain the spread of COVID-19, dozens of workers are being redeployed to assist seniors in Niagara's long-term care homes who are isolated due to visitor restrictions. Niagara seniors community program administrator Carol Rudel said about 50 staff who typically work with seniors in the community have been redeployed to help residents of the Region's eight long-term care homes stay in touch with family members and friends. The additional staff have been helping residents use iPads and communications software including Skype and social media to connect to family members. ""We're seeing people are happy at that moment in time. They're feeling supported and a little less lonely,"" Rudel said. ""Certainly, if you can't have your family come in to visit, there's a risk around loneliness and I think this effort has really addressed that,"" she said. ""It's been a proactive measure to address the risk that could come from the lack of personal interaction with your family."" Family members, too, share a sense of relief seeing their loved ones are safe. After chatting online with her parents Bill and Fay Hudgins, 93 and 94 years old, respectively, Lynda Desmarais said ""it's been really hard not being able to see them."" ""We are used to seeing them a couple of times a week,"" she said. ""The burden of not being available to them has been lessened significantly because of the help they are getting from the home."" She said her brother Reece Hudgins typically shares a few jokes with their father during those visits to Gilmore Lodge in Fort Erie. ""He usually reads them out loud during visits and they have a good laugh."" Although Desmarais said her brother can't visit their father personally, they are continuing to share jokes with the help of the redeployed adult day program staff. Joanne Vipari called it ""inspiring"" to see the words of her mother Betty Jean Pauli, 86, shared online - reassuring friends and family that she's safe and happy despite being under total lockdown, unable to have visitors or go out. Pauli wrote that she and her fellow residents at Deer Park Suites Assisted Living ""are doing our part to stay well, so hope everyone else takes care and does their part. ""Together we can lick this thing and maybe enjoy the nice weather coming. love to all my friends and relatives and keep well,"" she wrote. In an email, Vipari invited people who are ""feeling inconvenienced by self-isolation and social distancing"" to put themselves ""in our elderly populations shoes."" ""If you don't self-isolate for yourself please do it for our nurses, doctors, all front-line workers and please do it for those like my mom,"" Vipari wrote. A memo was issued to the Region's early childhood educators last week, telling them their ""skills can be utilized to support other areas of community service unless we have a directive to reopen childcare."" They, too, may find work at the seniors homes. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

""It just makes it more real than it already was and drives home that underlying message that we have to follow the protective measures,"" said Sendzik. ""You know, you might say, 'Oh well, I will only get mild symptoms.' But it is not only about you. It is about vulnerable people."" Sendzik's Wednesday comments about the death of the 84-year-old resident of Ian Grafton Gage Village of St. Catharines Tuesday were echoed by Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, who pointed out the virus disproportionally causes serious symptoms in the elderly and people with pre-existing medical issues. The 84-year-old was brought to St. Catharines hospital for an unrelated condition when it was discovered he had the virus. The public health department found he had been infected by a 58-year-old family member who had recently been to Europe. The elder's death was followed Wednesday morning with the confirmation of Niagara's eighth and ninth cases of COVID-19 infection. Both of the new patients are women in their 20s who had travelled to the United States, said Hirji. One of them had been on a cruise, Hirji said, noting again that during the pandemic no one should board a cruise ship. These latest cases, like the previous seven, involved travel abroad. There has yet to be any confirmed cases of community transmission unrelated to travel. ""It is happening elsewhere in Ontario. So it is likely to happen here. It is really just a matter of time,"" Hirji said. The number of confirmed Niagara cases is expected to rise as more local tests are done. Although the health department does not release local figures for testing - there have been more than 35,000 tests done in Ontario - Niagara Health is releasing the number of patients referred to its COVID-19 assessment centres in St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. As of Tuesday night, 514 people had been sent to the assessment centres. Some are tested or sent home to be self-isolated. People who require tests are sent to St. Catharines hospital or the emergency department. Hirji said the number of referrals by the health department to the assessment centres fell dramatically Wednesday to the point where only the St. Catharines centre was taking patients. Hirji said calls to the public health hotline also fell this week from about 900 calls a day to about 650. He said this is in part because of a general decline in the number of people who meet priority criteria for COVID-19 testing, which remains someone who is exhibiting symptoms - they include a fever and a cough - and a history of travel or exposure to someone who has recently travelled. ""The good news here is that this means we can start testing more people by lowering that threshold a little bit,"" Hirji said, noting the situation is fluid and if priority cases start to appear in large numbers again, testing will be focused on them due to the shortage of testing materials globally. Several people have expressed frustration with the inability to get a test done, despite their belief that they meet the criteria. On Wednesday afternoon, Hirji took to Twitter to explain restrictions on testing. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

So we're prioritizing. But we are testing many people with no travel, no obvious links. Even with prioritizing, greater than 97 per cent of tests are negative,"" he wrote. ""Testing isn't perfect, but it's very good. ""Where people aren't prioritized, it is understandably frustrating to have no certainty. We are also asking that they self-isolate until their symptoms resolve so that the infection doesn't spread.""

Coming out of Jesse and Kelly's No Frills in Fort Erie Thursday afternoon with a single item - steak for her dog - it was a stop she made after visiting Walmart a short distance away on Garrison Road. ""It's almost surreal,"" the Ridgeway woman said, describing the inside of each store as ""very quiet."" A security guard from Aquarius Security sat in front of the entrance of No Frills to make sure the building was not over-capacity. He said only management could speak to reporters. Local ownership for the store said corporate policy has left directions not make statements to the press but did confirm that no more than 50 customers are allowed inside at a time. Moore said she isn't too frightened about making frequent trips to grocery and department stores during the pandemic. ""I am a little, but I take precautions and wash my hands,"" said the mother of four young children. She said customers were being kept two metres apart waiting in line to be checked out by cashiers who were standing behind Plexiglas ""sneeze guards"" at their tills. ""She's probably exposed to so much, so it's a good idea,"" she said about the young woman who rang up her purchase. Public relations staff for Loblaw Cos., the corporation that owns No Frills, Shoppers Drug Mart, Real Canadian Superstore and Joe Fresh, said its stores continue to practise physical distancing and limit the number of people allowed in stores at one time. ""Some locations have repurposed their security teams to control the number of people in and out of the store,"" the corporation said in an emailed statement. Asked what percentage of stores had recruited a security guard, the company said ""given the scale"" it could not ""confirm an approximate number."" Loblaw has close to 2,500 stores in Canada. Ron Kore is the franchisee at Sobeys in Fonthill. He said he could not comment on measures being taken during the pandemic and that head office would need to be contacted. On Sunday, Empire, the company that owns Sobeys, announced it would be increasing the hourly wage of front-line workers by $2. Kore said his staff is paid a liveable wage, and will receive the boost on their paycheques. ""We are following corporate guidelines,"" said Kore, a Pelham town councillor. Loblaw is also giving its staff an extra two dollars an hour during the pandemic. Sobeys head office did not respond to an interview request Thursday. In a statement on Sobeys' website, Empire president Michael Medline said customers should expect ""significant changes"" at grocery and pharmacy locations.

To date, Sobeys has closed all self-serve, cafe and bulk food areas, reduced hours to allow for more cleaning, reserved the first hour of the shopping day for the most vulnerable people including seniors, and added floor markings and signage to promote physical distancing. ""We won't stop there. We will continue to safeguard our stores in this evolving situation,"" said Medline.

But Niagara Falls hotels are staring into an occupancy abyss this summer. As cancellations pour in and uncertainty looms over how long the pandemic will last, the industry is already planning a massive marketing campaign to lure visitors back after what promises to be the worst summer season since the SARS outbreak of 2003. ""I can tell you right now, the long haul markets are dead,"" said Doug Birrell, executive director of the Niagara Falls Canada Hotel Association. ""They're gone. Maybe you'll see a trickle in the fall, but it could be as long as a year. ""Those reliable markets that you've seen here - Japan, Korea and strong European visitation - we think will be non-existent for probably a year."" Which could translate to historically low occupancy rates for the city's 16,000 guest rooms. The SARS outbreak, coupled with a North American blackout and the U.S.-led war on Iraq, led to a devastating 58 per cent occupancy rate in Niagara Falls hotels that summer. Birrell believes occupancy for April will be ""well under five per cent,"" leading into a grim summer. ""We predict that volume could be down 35 to 40 per cent,"" he said. ""This is not an official number, just a first impression."" Niagara Falls Tourism chairwoman Janice Thomson said it's ""impossible to project"" how devastating the season will be this early into the pandemic, but all indications point to a summer much worse than 2003. ""This has gone so far beyond SARS,"" she said. ""(That) was an indication of what can happen when you're taken by surprise in a market, but SARS didn't have the impact this is having. ""This is attacking every single business."" For now, Thomson said tourism has to ""get out of the way"" and let health experts tackle the pandemic, then focus on the ""recovering period"" for the industry. To that end, Birrell said the Hotel Association - it represents 37 hotels and about 5,700 rooms in the city - is planning a massive campaign once the pandemic is over. ""It would be the biggest we've ever done,"" he said. ""You've got two broad categories - Niagara Falls for families and Niagara Falls for couples. We envision a spectacular value offer to come back to Niagara."" Thanks to an aggressive marketing campaign, the 2004 summer tourism season made a comeback, with hotel occupancy spiking to 73.9 per cent. But almost daily changes to the COVID-19 crisis makes it tough to guess when the recovery can begin. ""The business and political climate is too fluid and unpredictable,"" said Birrell. ""An example of this, the breaking news story that the U.S. is likely to send the military at the U.S.-Canadian border . we just don't know what this means to visitation."" - Niagara Falls tourism left reeling from coronavirus fallout Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

On Tuesday morning ""it was crazy"" outside the Costco store in St. Catharines, said Joan Dundas, who came to shop and found a long lineup of people waiting to get in. It was the first time the store was offering one hour of shopping exclusively for seniors and people with physical disabilities, starting 8 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was also the day after the provincial government announced all non-essential businesses would have to close during the COVID-19 outbreak. ""I was there around 7:35 a.m., at that point the line went from the front doors all the way around the side . down by the Y, then it wrapped back around almost to the front entrance,"" the St. Catharines woman said. At one point, she said, a Costco worker tried to shout instructions to the crowd but people near the end of the line couldn't hear. Even so, she said, ""everybody was very orderly, they had their carts everybody was six feet apart."" In line, people talked about the size of the crowd. Online afterward, she noticed, the talk on social media was concern about gathering so close together. On Thursday she returned, and this time, she said, it was ""very well organized."" A photo she took showed people outside with carts, spread apart in orderly fashion. Another St. Catharines resident, Robert Chausse, who lives near Costco and saw the crowds outside Tuesday, agreed: ""Much more organized this morning,"" he said Thursday. ""Obviously Costco addressed the issue."" ""I think it might have been just that it was their first time,"" Dundas said of the long lineup Tuesday. ""And nobody knows how to manage this, right?"" She added: ""It's a scary thing we've got going on now."" A representative for Costco could not be reached for comment. This week other large retailers, including Sobeys, Shoppers Drug Mart and Loblaw stores, also started setting aside shopping time exclusively for seniors and people with physical disabilities. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, acting medical officer of health for Niagara, said he has only ""a mild concern"" about situations like the one at Costco this week. He said he hasn't heard reports of concerns over similar situations at Niagara stores. ""It's not ideal, but I don't think it is particularly high risk. The risk is when you are close, with face to face interaction with anyone. ""In that lineup, you're probably facing the back of someone so if they're coughing or something it's not something you're going to breathe in."" He added: ""I do recommend, out of an abundance of caution, that you try to keep space between you and the person in front of you. The line will spread out quite a bit more as a result, but I think that would be the best practice."" Since the COVID-19 virus is especially lethal for seniors and people with weakened immune systems, he likes the idea of stores designating time for them to shop alone. ""We know seniors are particularly susceptible . having them have their own period, I think it does protection them from interaction perhaps with other groups that might have the infection."" He's also happy some stores have installed Plexiglas barriers separating staff at the checkout from customers. ""I think of the measures that have been most effective, first off a lot of stores now have a hand-washing station at the entrance,"" he said.

So when the provincial government closed all schools indefinitely, staff at Community Crew vowed to continue their mission. Community Crew's lunch program began at a St. Catharines school and has grown to feed more than 700 children each week at 12 schools across the region. ""We couldn't sit by and just do nothing,"" said director Sarah Pritula. ""We couldn't go to the schools, so we decided to bring the lunches to the families."" Three staff members now offer door-to-door delivery of prepackaged lunches to make sure the children served during the school year are still getting the support they need. ""We want to ensure anyone who needs a lunch, if they're part of our program or not, that we are able to drop off lunches."" Parents can register online at www.communitycrew.ca. The agency completed drop-offs in St. Catharines on Tuesday, followed by Niagara Falls on Wednesday. The crew was in Welland and Fort Erie on Thursday and additional drop-off dates are scheduled for next week. ""We've never done anything like this before,"" Pritula said. ""We're working really hard to make sure we can get out to as many kids who sign up as possible."" To keep things sanitary, surfaces are continually washed and sanitized, and staff use prepackaged foods when possible. Wednesday's menu, for example, was a turkey wrap, yogurt tube, water bottle, nut-free snack, a Mandarin orange and baby carrots. On Thursday, the agency issued an appeal for financial donations in support of the program. Donations can be made through Community Crew's website. Meanwhile, Food4Kids Niagara is also switching gears to meet the needs of children during these difficult times. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the program delivered packages of healthy food to vulnerable students at local schools every Friday. Now, volunteers are doing door-drop deliveries to residences in Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Welland and Fort Erie. ""We're serving the people who are already in our program first, but we are also trying to reach all the families we can because people are in crisis and we know that they're trying to do more with fewer resources and it's just going to get more difficult for families to manage,"" said executive director Amber Hughes. Food4Kids Niagara is funded by community donors and one-time grants. Hughes said the community has stepped up to the plate to help by making financial donations at www.food4kidsniagara.ca. ""The community has been phenomenal,"" she said. ""They know there's a need and they're responding."" Also, the agency recently partnered with Niagara Nutrition Partners, a non-profit program that offers support for student nutrition programs at elementary and secondary schools. It has provided food vouchers, which Hughes says will help stretch the food budget. - Niagara Chinese community rallies to fund local medical supplies Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Learn from Home offers resources compiled by DSBN while schools remain closed during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The site is organized by grade, subject and area of interest, with English, science, math, French, arts and more. Resources include elementary (kindergarten to Grade 8), secondary (grades 9-12), special education, mental-health and well-being support, supplementary links to other credible, online learning, and a direct link to the Ministry of Education's Learn at Home website. DSBN officials said launching Learn from Home is a first step in getting Niagara students and families access to local learning as they navigate this unprecedented time. Each week, additional resources will be added to the website. The second phase of the plan will include teacher-led instruction, where students will have online learning directly with their teacher. All teachers have been asked to call their students' families on Monday. The board said because not every family has access to a computer or the Internet, officials are also working on ways to provide families with devices and online access. Families should contact their school principal if they need support. - Niagara school boards still offering counselling to kids despite shutdown - Some of Ontario's Learn at Home program 'complete garbage,' parent says - Niagara school boards to continue taking COVID-19 direction from province - Ontario launches 'learn at home' online program for students during school shutdown Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

It's a component of the economic rapid response team, formed by Regional Chair Jim Bradley and Niagara's 12 mayors, and various economic development offices in the region. It has been completed by close to 3,600 businesses already, Kuhns said Friday. The survey closes Monday at midnight and the data will form a ""snapshot in time"" to ""highlight the issues and difficulties our companies are experiencing."" It will be complied in a report that will be delivered to the provincial and federal governments. Another survey will follow in about a month, said Kuhns, adding it's vital to monitor the impact COVID-19 is having on businesses. ""Obviously, once this is all over we want to make sure we have a strong economy going forward."" Kuhns said the capacity Niagara's industry is operating at now won't be known until early next week after the survey closes. ""I think we'll have a better idea of that as we start to pull the report together,"" she said, adding a ""pretty good cross-section"" of businesses have participated. Many local manufacturers continue operating because their products are considered by the government to be essential. The survey will determine what areas of Niagara's business community are facing the greatest hardships. Tourism, Kuhns said, is ""suffering greatly."" In Welland at Innio, a manufacturer of natural gas engines, equipment and related solutions for power generation, operations are in full swing. There are 260 people employed at the plant at Buchner Road and Highway 140. That includes 185 manufacturing employees spread between two shifts. Non-manufacturing staff and non-critical support personnel have been instructed to work from home during the pandemic, said spokeswoman Michelle Neira, adding there are no more than 100 employees inside the plant at once. She said the company is taking steps to keep employees healthy and safe. ""We are working hard to keep our primary operations active so that we can continue to serve our power generation and gas compression customers around the globe,"" she said. Separating work into two shifts and enforcing increased sanitation measures have been priorities as well. Innio's products are also considered essential, supplying critical businesses as well as ""parts and services that are crucial to supporting key infrastructure in natural gas and power generation services across the globe,"" said Neira. ""These products and services are necessary in the manufacturing of products utilized in critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, water and wastewater treatment, and health care."" The company's engines are used in 56 hospitals in 13 U.S. states providing critical backup electrical power, Neira said. ""The world is counting on our engines, parts and services to provide critical energy infrastructure and power for hospitals, utilities and municipalities worldwide,"" she said. Dan Degazio, general manager of economic development, recreation and culture for the City of Welland, said employers that are still operating fall under the essential goods category. He said it's difficult to estimate the percentage of Welland industries still open during the pandemic. ""This is an extraordinary time and I wouldn't want to venture a guess,"" he said.

Brock's head of library systems and technology Jonathan Younker said the university is using the 3D printers in the Brock Library Makerspace to create 100 face shields, to protect paramedics as they respond to emergency calls with patients who may be at risk of spreading the virus. Niagara Emergency Medical Services paramedic Randy McDougall called the university's efforts ""a really big deal that they're stepping up like this and helping us out."" ""Although we haven't run out of our current stock and we've done a good job to keep things moving, at some point we're at risk because there's not a lot of stock out there,"" he said. ""It's a really big deal that they're not only making this for us but they're donating it to us."" Younker said Makerspace co-ordinator Tabitha Lewis was the first to recognize the potential of using the technology within the facility to meet the needs of Niagara's health care workers by fabricating protective equipment they need. ""All the credit goes to her for this. It's something she really wanted to do."" He estimated the university will be able to produce about 20 face shields a day, once it receives supplies needed to assemble them. ""For us, 20 per day is a lot. It's not an industrial manufacturing level,"" he said. The university does not have the capacity to produce enough face shields to fully meet the needs of the paramedics, but McDougall said the contribution will still be enough to help keep paramedics safe until they can obtain a larger supply. World Health Organization estimates that each month, the global response to the COVID-19 will require 89 million medical masks, 76 million examination gloves, and 1.6 million goggles. WHO estimates equipment manufacturing needs to increase by about 40 per cent to meet the demand. ""There's not a lot of manufacturers and most of them aren't here in Canada,"" McDougall said. ""But there are a lot of companies stepping up like Brock's doing to switch over their manufacturing into PPE (personal protective equipment) for us, and we're following up on every possible lead like that."" Younker said the university is also looking for ways the facility can be used to assist other health care workers, such as at hospitals. ""We're getting a lot of request from others,"" he said, referring to frontline workers at businesses and other organizations. ""Hopefully, as more people learn about it, we hope a network is able to help others out as well."" Niagara Health's executive vice-president of clinical services and chief nursing executive Derek McNally said hospitals are anticipating increased need for protective equipment, despite efforts to conserve supplies. ""We truly appreciate the public's assistance in helping to keep our patients, staff and physicians safe,"" he said, adding donations are being co-ordinated through the Niagara Health Foundation. He asked anyone interested donating PPE or other supplies to contact the foundation at 905-323-3863, or visit their website. McDougall said paramedics, too, would be grateful for any additional community donations. ""Anything that anybody has that can help us, we are happy to accept,"" he said. He said people who have items that might be helpful to paramedics can email the Niagara EMS community relations specialist at Bryce.Brunarski@niagararegion.ca.

""How you guys doing? You good? What's going on? What's new?"" he asks, before launching into a solo workout, his voice echoing in the empty gym. When the province mandated closures of non-essential services to curb the spread of COVID-19, Giancola had no choice but to close the doors at BTO Performance. Now he hosts online fitness classes using Facebook Live to give people a healthy distraction from current world events. Anyone is welcome to check out his videos on social media, where he now hosts two 30-minute sessions five days a week with plans to add a Saturday workout in the future. ""This is not about business,"" he said. ""This is not just about the people in the studio. This is about all those people who are cooped up, isolated in their homes and not being able to do anything. ""The anxiety is going up through the roof, people are worrying about their kids, worrying about money or, if you're like me, on Facebook every five minutes and reading about everything that's horrible in the world right now."" While fitness centres and studios have closed their doors due to the coronavirus pandemic, several local operators have turned to social media to keep people mentally and physically fit. Jeremy Elliott, owner of United Family Martial Arts in Niagara Falls, posts daily workout videos on his YouTube channel and other social media platforms. ""I want to be part of the community and I want to be positive,"" he said. ""We're at the point where we see the news and everybody is nervous, there's so much uncertainty. I wanted to be the light they can look to daily to see the positive."" Evidence suggests exercise can improve mental health by reducing anxiety and depression. ""We're all going to be facing more and more challenges,"" Elliott said. ""A strong body will be a strong mind, which is what we're all going to need at this time."" Lost 'n Found Yoga, which operates studios in St. Catharines and Fort Erie, closed its doors several weeks ago, prior to the mandatory shutdown. ""We could tell this was not something we wanted to continue, just because of the risk to our clients,"" said Bill Janzen, who operates the studio with his wife, April. Members now participate in virtual classes. April Janzen distributes three video classes daily via email. She has also hosted several live classes through Zoom, a video conferencing service. ""We want to keep the community going,"" she said. ""People miss it, and we miss seeing each other."" ""For a lot of people, yoga is a daily practice,"" Bill added. ""Now we can't see them, but want them to be able to continue their practice, especially now that we're feeling isolated and depressed and physically inactive.""

""We're such social creatures … through so much of human history, we have been face to face creatures and we gathered around a fire to share. We're such storytelling creatures."" said Jennifer Good, an associate professor in communication, popular culture and film. Good, who teaches classes on the psychology of screens, said screens have changed the way we tell stories and the way in which we are social. They've also changed the way we consume information. But her students would say they are being social while on their devices and looking at their screens, texting, sharing photos and information, and creating content. ""Those same screens that have up to now been distracting us from the moment are now bringing us to the moment … socially and information-wise to the moment. ""They are helpful, we know that. We can see groups of people playing instruments together, singing,"" said Good, adding they can bring happiness to people in the uncertain times. The Brock University professor spoke recently about the COVID-19 pandemic and how people are using technology to get together and be with friends and family even as they maintain physical distance. She's used technology to keep in touch with her sister-in-law in New York City and hold classes with her students at Brock. Sunday, Melissa Campion used Zoom — a video conferencing platform using a web link on laptops or via a cellphone app — to hold a virtual dinner with her brother John, sister Lisa and parents, Liz and Frank, Welland's mayor. ""I was talking to my brother about how my colleagues and I are keeping connected socially — daily stretch breaks, happy hour after work, weekly pizza parties, weekly drop-ins and office hours … he mentioned how great it was that we were able to socialize and it would be great if our family could do the same,"" said Melissa, 36, who agreed to host the dinner. Lisa, 24, said family dinners are important to the Campion family and it's something they've always done. She said the virtual dinner was a way to think outside of the box and turn into a new family tradition given everyone's distance from each other. ""Personally, it's what I look forward to the most when I go back home. Sitting around the table and enjoying a nice meal with people you love. It keeps you grounded and it's just good to just connect and laugh,"" she said in an email interview from Guelph. Melissa, who lives in Cambridge, said family dinners were always full of good food and lots of laughter. John, 34, said they have become more important since he moved to Montreal about six months ago. ""This is very important to me. It's difficult at times to be so far away from family and friends in a new city and a new province,"" he said of holding the virtual dinner. In an email, Melissa said it's important to have human and social interaction, while still practising physical distancing. ""Additionally, we also need happy and positive things to focus on during this time. This dinner is important to me not only because it allows our family to be together while also doing our part to flatten the curve, but I know it will be a lot of fun,"" she said. John said there was no set menu for the family to cook and eat together and it came down to what was available in grocery stores.

""Frank will be doing the dishes,"" she joked. Frank said it's been difficult for everyone to together due to distance, his schedule as mayor and his children's work schedules. ""Melissa may be on to something here that will help out, maybe even a virtual Easter event."" He said the pandemic has been virtually all-encompassing as mayor and has posed multiple challenges for everyone at city hall and in the community.

And that worries Niagara Falls resident Clarke Bitter. Bitter said he and his wife took a drive down Clifton Hill and along Niagara Parkway at about 5 p.m. Sunday anticipating empty sites. But that was not the case. He said there was ""a lot of traffic"" on Clifton Hill even though businesses were closed. The area around Table Rock was busy, he said, with at least 100 to 150 people. Dufferin Islands was similar, with parked cars and no one in them. Bitter said while some people were practising social distancing, it became hard when more groups came together. This, on the same weekend the provincial government prohibited organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people to further stop the spread of COVID-19. Bitter said he was driving while his wife, Lisa, took photos. ""Because we've been cooped up in the house, we thought, 'Let's go for a drive, we're not going to stop and get out of the car, I just want to go and take pictures of the emptiness,'"" he said. ""As we drove by the falls, I was flabbergasted. I almost stopped in the street to start yelling at people, 'Go home!'"" Bitter said he saw kids up on railings and that ""almost every single"" parking spot in Dufferin Islands had a car in it. ""I watched this one young girl grab a hand railing, lick her hand, grab the hand railing, touch her sister, lick her hand, touch the hand railing, touch her hair, touch her eyes."" He said there were ""a few people"" wearing masks. Although Niagara Parks announced it was closing all its public-facing operations March 14, including attractions, restaurants, retail stores, golf courses, as well as the Wego green line bus service and Falls Incline Railway, Bitter questioned why parking lots remain open. He said Wego buses the city operates were dropping groups of people off at the falls. ""You have to make it very difficult for groups of people to get down to the falls right now. If they can literally park across the street from it, or get dropped off at it by transit, they're going to go."" Just before 5 p.m. Monday, the City of Niagara Falls sent out a press release stating its red-line service to and from Table Rock along Niagara Parkway will be reduced shortly to mitigate non-essential travel to that location and Niagara Parks properties. David Adames, chief executive officer for Niagara Parks, said it has installed signs in public spaces and along trails, reminding people to not use the parks if they're exhibiting symptoms, to wash their hands frequently, provide others with proper physical distancing, and be prepared for limited access to restrooms.

He said Niagara Parks manages a 56-kilometre system with 1,300 hectares, ""so we wouldn't be able to close all those areas."" ""But we are really trying hard to get that message out about what public-health officials are saying and the chief medical officer of health is saying: social distancing, if you are out but, of course, first and foremost, people should be staying home."" Adames said Niagara Parks has not closed its parking lots because if people are going to be out, officials would rather they park safely than stop on the road or park on sidewalks. He said Niagara Parks also created a webpage dedicated to COVID-19. Niagara Falls Tourism president Janice Thomson said while she has seen photos of larger crowds, she has also seen photos ""with absolutely no one anywhere, so it's obviously a mixed experience."" She said it's not up to tourism officials to tell people to stay away from the area. ""We're not the ones giving the messaging. The messaging has to be very carefully listened to and it's coming from those public health authorities and from the government. The (messaging) has to be respected by everyone but enforced by the appropriate authorities."" - Ontario reports largest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases so far - Del Duca urges Ford to help long-term care workers, fast-track foreign-trained health professions - Ontario shutters all outdoor recreational amenities; 10 new deaths in Ontario, two in Toronto; Ontarians over 70 urged to stay home as province reports 351 new cases - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Based in Beamsville with a registered client base of about 525 people, ""we tend to know our people fairly intimately,"" said executive director Carole Fuhrer. ""And we're seeing lots of new faces, and we're happy that they're coming, but we know there are more people that we can help."" In less than two weeks, she figured, demand for assistance has gone up nearly 15 per cent. ""We are seeing more people we haven't had interactions with,"" she said. That sudden, growing need is being felt all across the region, said Frances Hallworth, executive director of United Way Niagara. On the weekend, the federal government announced $9 million in emergency funding for United Way Canada to share with local agencies across the country. ""Ever since that announcement was made on Sunday morning, our phone lines are busy with individuals calling in wanting assistance with groceries and prescriptions,"" said Hallworth. ""We don't even have the money."" United Way doesn't hand out food directly, anyway; it provides funding to other agencies that do help people with food and other services. Her staff has been directing callers to those groups and organizations. Food is the greatest need right now, she said. The $9 million Ottawa gave to United Way Canada - from the New Horizon Seniors Program - is to be shared by 80 local offices across the country. The funding is specifically targeted for programs that help seniors. Not only is COVID-19 especially lethal for that group, seniors can also find it difficult to bring in food and other supplies during these days of social distancing and isolation. ""(The government's) reasoning was the seniors are at the greatest risk for poor health outcomes from COVID-19, and they're also struggling with social isolation,"" Hallworth said. She hopes to learn later this week what Niagara's share will be, and to learn more about how the program will be rolled out and local agencies can get assistance. ""We're really looking forward to more information from the federal government . things are coming out every single day from the federal government, so I don't expect this would take a long time,"" she said. Since United Way Niagara started its own emergency fund to help agencies struggling during COVID-19, just more than a week ago, ""the response has been very good."" ""We're a little over $38,000 right now collected from the community,"" she said. ""I think that's absolutely wonderful."" Donations to that fund can be made at canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. At Community Care of West Niagara, Fuhrer said she has been trying to keep up with the steady stream of new government assistance. ""That's my light reading at night - so how does this work with that, and then making sure my team is apprised"" so they can help people who show up asking for help to navigate government assistance programs.

Having so many programs shut down in the community has presented a new program to the food bank. Typically, a lot of donations come in in the months leading up to January, then what Fuhrer called ""donor fatigue"" sets in for a while before donations pick up again before Easter. That hasn't happened this year and the agency has a real need for items such as canned fruit and soup, rice, flour and small bags of sugar. Before showing up at the Central Avenue site, though, she asked people first phone ahead to 905-563-5822. ""Normally all the schools always do food drives for us, the churches do food drives for us, special interest groups do,"" Fuhrer said.

Take perishable food items. Fresh fruit and vegetables are a welcome addition to a food hamper and sometimes hard to come by. That's not the case these days for the agency which helps individuals and families with everything from food to clothing and shelter. Instead of the usual head of lettuce, some clients are leaving with three-pound bags said Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter. Community Care doesn't break anything down. Perishables go out the same way they come in. ""We have had a significant amount of perishable foods from restaurants,"" said Souter. ""Restaurants buy in larger amounts, so we are getting three-pound bags of lettuce for people. ""In some ways, it breaks your heart. We have had a couple of restaurateurs here begin to cry because this could be the end of their business."" Restaurants across Niagara have been making food donations since the province urged, then order them to close. Theargesse goes beyond salad, too. The downtown St. Catharines facility on North Street is ripe with bananas. It's a sweet problem to have, she admitted. ""We have enough bananas to keep going for a while, and I'm not sure why,"" Souter said. ""We received another skid today. There are three or four skids."" The challenge has been getting the bananas out the door before they go bad. ""Everybody is going home with bananas,"" Souter said. ""It is very different from what we usually get, which is a lot of non-perishables. The challenge is storing all of it."" Part the challenge with an abundance of perishables is refrigeration space. What they can't keep, they give away to other agencies. ""We have shared with upwards of 15 or 20 groups — Project Share, Silver Spire, Start Me Up,"" Souter said. ""We have a network in Niagara. We tell each other what we have, and we share back and forth. ""At the same time, if any other organization wants some, all they have to do is call me."" Community Care recently put in a request for a grant to construct another walk-in refrigerator. The extra capacity would have helped this week. ""No one wants to see this any of this go into the landfill,"" Souter said. ""The problem is some stuff from restaurants is dated, and we have to be careful of the health and safety of everybody."" Souter said some restaurants have used their produce to make hearty homemade soup for clients to take home. ""My concern is what happens in a month,"" Souter said. ""There won't be any more restaurant orders. ""Everybody is cancelling food drives. The Rankin Run always has a food drive for us. That's cancelled. ""These are very challenging times. The proof will be in the pudding in the coming of weeks. We have to see how long this lasts."" - Here's how you can help the Niagara community during the coronavirus outbreak Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

As fears grow among tenants who may not be able to pay their rent on Wednesday, as well as among property owners who rely on those payments to cover costs, St. Catharines MPP Jennie Stevens joined other provincial representatives and organizations in urging both sides to work together. ""I'm calling on landlords to work with their tenants at this time,"" Stevens said. ""When landlords work with tenants, good things happen and the anxiety levels out."" She said many tenants who have found themselves laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic are for the first time in their lives facing the reality that they cannot pay their rent. ""They're lying awake, wondering, 'How am I going to pay my rent.' Let's face it, they had no wiggle room in their budgets . If the landlords and tenants work together and relieve their anxiety, I think good things will happen."" Niagara Falls MPP Wayne Gates said in the midst of the crisis ""people should be focused on their health, not rent or paying for groceries."" While the New Democratic Party members are calling for rent subsidies of up to 80 per cent for tenants in need, to a maximum of $2,500 a month - they say that will benefit both tenants and landlords - Niagara West MPP Sam Oosterhoff said both federal and provincial governments are taking action. While the Canada Emergency Response Benefit provides $2,000 a month, he said eviction proceedings have been suspended, funding is being provided to help municipalities and social service providers continue their work, and additional initiatives are designed to reduce costs for consumers. ""Tenants who can pay their rent must do so, to the best of their abilities,"" Oosterhoff said. ""At the same time, we are calling on landlords to be as flexible as possible when it comes to collecting rent at this very difficult time."" The province, he added, is working closely with all levels of government ""and will continue to do everything we can and will consider all available options in order to get through these difficult and uncertain times."" Tribunals Ontario spokeswoman Sarah Copeland said the Landlord Tenant Board is not hearing eviction applications and is not issuing eviction orders, ""except in extremely urgent and exceptional circumstances"" such as when circumstances could pose a threat to life or safety. ""If a tenant is unable to pay their rent because of current circumstances, they should speak to their landlord about whether rent can be postponed or if other payment arrangements can be put in place,"" she said in an email. ""If a landlord and tenant are unable to reach an acceptable resolution, we recommend that parties seek legal advice on their options."" Niagara Poverty Reduction Network issued a statement Tuesday calling on the provincial government to place a moratorium on rent obligations for tenants who can't afford to pay Wednesday. The organization said that moratorium should remain in place until emergency funding such as rent subsidies are in place, and as such any eviction applications that are filed would be nullified. ""In order to ensure that landlords are able to pay their mortgages and expenses in the wake of the proposed moratorium, NPRN also calls on the government to legislate postponement of the mortgage obligations of landlords impacted by the moratorium,"" the organization adds. Ontario Real Estate Association shared a similar message. ""If tenants can afford to pay their rent, then they should pay. If they cannot, landlords and tenants should work together with support from the Ontario government to find a solution that protects everyone's health, safety and financial well-being,"" OREA president Sean Morrison said in a media release. He said small mom and pop landlords ""are particularly vulnerable"" if they cannot earn rent, especially during a prolonged state of emergency, and called on the province to ensure landlords do not ""suffer financial hardship, lose their investments and exit the rental market altogether.""

An initiative has been formed to deliver takeout food to staff at Niagara Health urgent care sites in Port Colborne, Welland and Fort Erie. It's been made possible with community donations made through e-transfer, reduced pricing from restaurants, and the mandate of clubs to show support to communities during difficult times. ""This is what we do all the time - fundraise and figure out what needs have to be met in the community,"" said Young. Port Colborne Optimist Club is partnering with the Lioness club to deliver the food. Blackadder Leon and Fazari LLP and Dobsi Medical have pitched in to raise about $1,200 that will be spent on meals. Social media and word of mouth with club members friends and families have played a role, she said. Pie Guys, a Port Colborne business that has been closed during the pandemic, has reopened its kitchen briefly to cook for the program. Market Cafe, also in Port Colborne, has provided food for the effort at a lower-than-normal cost. Baked goods and wraps are on the menu each day. Sobeys in Port Colborne has donated fruit to the cause. Young said the program is meant to support small businesses during such a challenging time. When food is dropped off, precautions are taken, she said. Items are left with people posted at site entrances who are there to screen people coming in. Young travels alone in her vehicle. ""We don't go in the ER. We're being very careful,"" she said. The work and dedication of hospital staff needs to be recognized in such an unprecedented and unusual time, Young said Wednesday, before another round of deliveries were to be made in the three south Niagara communities the program is focusing on.

""I had the idea to just put a table out,"" said Kedzierski, who owns St. Joseph Bakery on Facer Street in St. Catharines. ""Originally it was going to be my own thing, where at the end of the business day I would put product out and allow anyone to come up and take what they need."" A week ago, he found a two-metre table and put out about 20 loaves of bread and 10 bags of buns after the store closed. He posted it to his Facebook page, and about 20 people came out. By the end of the night the food was gone. Soon others were contributing canned goods or money to buy more food, such as pasta and sauce, and Kedzierski needed a bigger table. Then someone was able to secure four skids full of produce from Gordon Food Service, near Toronto. And the people kept coming. ""Every day, it's been growing,"" said Kedzierski, who figures the bakery has given away 200 loaves of bread and just as many bags of buns. ""It's not a big deal for me to give what I make, I've got lots of it. But I didn't realize the community demand was so high."" Now the table goes out after closing time each night: Monday to Friday it closes close at 6 p.m., Saturdays at 5 p.m. and Sundays at 4:30 p.m. The food is free for people who need it. All Kedzierski and his staff ask is that people take what they need but leave some for others. ""It's not my place to ask questions, so if they're there then I assume they have the need. And no one is watching, either,"" he said. ""We're there to replenish. Sometimes there's not enough room or more people turn out than we're expecting, so we'll come back out and fill more. ""But we're not there to judge or ask questions at all."" One person there Tuesday night called it ""a great example of sharing."" ""It's a pretty simple concept,"" said the man, who didn't want to be identified. Beside him, Katrina Nimeth said, ""I very much appreciate it, because it's hard to get into the grocery stores for people everywhere."" Kedzierski said, ""My idea was to do it until the COVID pandemic was done and we got through this. But I'll base it on community need after that."" - with files from Julie Jocsak - Going bananas at Community Care as restaurants drop off perishables Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

They went from bringing the tabby home from Lincoln County Humane Society on a temporary basis during the COVID-19 crisis to making him part of the family permanently. ""We failed so fast,"" she said. ""It might be a record, I'm not sure."" Wilkinson is among an astonishing 400 people who reached out to the humane society when it put out a call for cat and dog foster families during the pandemic. The St. Catharines animal shelter now expects all of its eligible cats and dogs will be out of cages and into homes by this weekend due to the unprecedented response. ""It's refreshing to see that so many people were willing to step up when we asked the question,"" said executive director Kevin Strooband. ""It was like nothing I could have anticipated."" The humane society had to limit its dog walker program and cancel its cat socialization program during the pandemic to enforce social distancing. While the basic needs of just more than a hundred animals were being taken care of, they were cooped up. A story in The St. Catharines Standard last Thursday detailed the humane society's desire to get the animals out of the Fourth Avenue shelter and into homes. The response was overwhelming. Strooband said when the humane society has put out pleas for cat foster parents in the past, it usually received 10 or so responses. Even when it has seized adorable puppies from puppy mills, he said it hasn't had a reaction like this. ""It's the right place and the right time, where people have the time and they're potentially sitting at home. So it works out really well,"" he said. The process of getting the animals out of the shelter into homes is a little challenging during the pandemic but the humane society has made it work. Interviews with potential foster families are being done by phone and the humane society tries to find a cat or dog that suits the person's lifestyle based on behavioural ratings. When it comes time for the handover, the animal is put in a carrier with everything they need and placed in the entry space between the shelter's double doors. The person picking up the pet signs a form and leaves it behind so there's no physical contact with a humane society employee. Strooband said it has enough foster parents lined up now, including Strooband, who brought home a three-week-old kitten that arrived at the shelter earlier this week. About 60 animals have already left the shelter and there are already 10 ""failed fosters,"" including Wilkinson, her husband and two daughters who are adopting Rusty instead of fostering him. ""I had a feeling where this could lead if it ended up being the right cat,"" she laughed. Wilkinson and her 13-year-old daughter Emma volunteer as cat socializers at the humane society typically once a week but haven't been able to do it because of COVID-19. She said they know how important it is for the cats to have time out of their cages to stretch and be around people. As socializers, they interact with the cats in a playroom, or in their cages if they are very timid, and take notes about them for anyone who might want to adopt. She hadn't met Rusty before because he was a stray who had only been at the shelter for three days when they picked him up. She said he's turned out to be sweet and friendly, and gets along with the family's other four cats who eye him suspiciously. ""He's totally chill. He's not the least bit bothered by these other cats roaming around,"" she said.

The owner of People's Variety on Portage Road in Niagara Falls is not a big fan of social media. He had his son Steve take a look for him. What he saw was disturbing. The post called for a boycott of the store, and accused Lee of price-gouging on hand sanitizer and toilet paper during the COVID-19 crisis. The post began with, ""We need to make this viral!!! Share the hell out of this!!!"" People took the plea and ran with it. The post had 2,000 shares within a couple of hours. By Wednesday morning, the share total surpassed the 7,000 mark. There were also phone calls. Profanity was a common denominator. There were racial slurs. Lee was documenting the calls at first with the phone number and a notation about the content. He even recorded a couple. He abandoned the exercise. The phone would not stop ringing. He figures he received about 100 calls the first day. Lee remembered the customer. She was upset about the price. He shrugged it off. You see a lot behind the counter of a convenience store. He's been robbed. One crime made headlines in The Niagara Falls Review a few years back. Lee said he has never experienced anything like this. He didn't want to explain mom-and-pop convenience stores operate on thin margins. His markup on the hand sanitizer was three dollars on a total of $14.99. The post also talked about being charged $19.99 for an eight-pack of toilet paper. That had him scratching his head. He doesn't carry eight-packs. He sells 15 packs for $10.99 (with the same margin). Earlier in the week, he drove to his wholesaler in Etobicoke and picked up some cases of hand sanitizer and toilet tissue. He dropped some off to friends who also own convenience stores in Niagara Falls to save them the trip. Lee fronted the price of $406.80. The drive usually takes more than three hours there and back but took two hours this time. Traffic was light. Nonetheless, he said by the time the cost of the trip is added the margin is tighter. Lee has the receipt. He's eager to show it. ""I never said what is on the post,"" Lee said. ""My regular customers know our family. They know this is something we would not do."" Lee estimates about 70 per cent of his clientele are regulars. They reassured him that they knew the Facebook post wasn't true. He's owned the store for years, and it has provided for his family. He is not sure about how much this is costing him. Business is down, but it might be because of the wave of unemployment that comes with social distancing. Lee said he considered options about how to respond. He is sure there is a legal basis for a lawsuit for defamation and loss of business. He ruled it out. The retainer costs thousands of dollars. He probably wouldn't be able to recoup enough to cover his legal fees. Lee considered having his son mount a defence on social media. ""I don't want to do that,"" Lee said. ""I don't want to fight about it on social media. That is only going to bring more trouble."" He reached out to Kenny Shim for help. Shim is chief operating officer of the Ontario Korean Businessmen's Association. Shim tried to contact the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services and circulated an open letter titled, ""Convenience Stores Do Not Price Gouge - They serve the community."" The snitch line set up by the government is proving popular. Harry Malhi, strategic issues and media adviser with the ministry, said the government is receiving more than 1,000 responses a day. The total for the first three days was about 3,800. He didn't offer a comment on the veracity of the complaints.

The penalty for price-gouging for an individual is a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to one year in jail. A company director faces a maximum fine of $500,000 and a year in jail. A corporation could be fined up to $10 million. Shim's association represents more than 1,000 store owners. Shim said his members ""support the provincial initiative"" and ""welcome the scrutiny."" Shim's letter compared the price of hand sanitizer at a national chain hardware store ($16), other convenience stores ($12.99 to $14.99) and an international online retailer ($15 with a $15 delivery charge). Some countries have banned the export of hand sanitizer, Shim said. That puts more pressure on the price. ""We had a big order coming from the U.S., but it was stuck at the border,"" Shim said. ""Then Trump said none of it leaves the country - and the order was cancelled."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford recently zeroed in on Pusateri's, a fine food and grocery chain in Toronto, which was selling disinfectant wipes for $29.99. Shim said his association uses the same supplier. The wholesale cost is about $5. The stores in his association have been selling them for about $8.99. ""That's the average margin for convenience stores,"" Shim said. ""We don't have the leverage of the chains like Sobeys and Loblaws. We have to buy in small quantities, and the price is higher. ""I feel for Mr. Lee. Owners like him often work 14 hours a day. This has been devastating for him and his family."" - They bought up Lysol wipes and resold them online for a profit.

In a news release Friday, the municipality said 15-full time unionized employees were told Thursday that their services are not required currently during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in addition to 12 full-time transit drivers, 17 full-time public works casuals, and 23 part-time staff, which includes transit operators, transit terminal clerks, and recreation staff. Last week, Welland Public Library issued temporary layoff notices to 22 part-time staff and on Thursday, eight full-time unionized library staff received temporary layoff notices. Welland Museum has issued layoff notices to two part-time staff and two full-time contract staff. In Friday's news release, CAO Gary Long said staffing levels are being reduced as a result of events and programs being cancelled and public facilities being closed until the end of June. ""We've also reduced transit staff and service levels as a result of significantly reduced ridership. With this reduction in work, we are adjusting our staff complement,"" he said. Decisions impacting the livelihood and well-being of staff have ""not been taken lightly"" by senior staff, Long said. The head administrator at city hall says the local government's corporate leadership team respects its mandate to provide public services, as well as ""the fact that these services are paid for by the taxpayers, many of whom have been impacted financially by the economic shocks of COVID-19."" He said the corporation will continue to ""focus on strong financial management and using taxpayer dollars wisely."" In an interview Friday, Long said all staff were given five days' notice before the layoffs take effect. Asked if some employees could have been redeployed to other positions and responsibilities, he said some have been moved around. ""We certainly had those discussions,"" said Long, providing one example of this currently taking place. He said front-line customer service representatives who normally have face-to-face interactions are being put at switchboards to handle public inquiries. Long said no staff from the city's by-law department are impacted. Laid off employees will continue to be eligible for health and dental benefits, but Long said he did not have information on for how long this would be the case. He said 17 casual public works staff being kept from work will not impact necessary work needed around the city. There are close to 400 people employed by the municipality, including paid firefighters, said Long. The library's 30 staff and four at the museum are not factored into this number, he added. Library CEO Julianne Brunet said her staff are incredible employees who make valuable contributions to the lives of library users every single day. ""Once it is safe to do so, we anticipate recalling all of our employees so that they may resume the transformational work that they do to support a healthy and strong community,"" she said.

In an interview Friday, he said the city could have done more to find responsibilities for those who were given notice. ""To me, the work is there for most of those folks - maybe not all of them,"" he said, adding that recreation employees ""could have been deployed elsewhere."" He also said layoffs in the engineering department don't appear to be necessary. ""I don't think that work is slowing down at all,"" he said. He also said a finance employee being handed a temporary pink slip could have been reconsidered. Leavitt also believes the city should be using contingency funds put away for emergencies like the impacts of COVID-19.

""We do feel like we've come together,"" said Hilary Abbey, principal of the Dorchester Road school. ""Although we're apart physically, we've had to come together using different methods of communication. The immediate connection with every single family was a necessity, not just for technology (reasons) but to also make sure everybody was OK."" She said the school reached out to every family to see which students needed equipment so they can continue learning from home during the global health crisis. Abbey said all District School Board of Niagara schools are doing the same, handing out necessary equipment on different days. On Friday, about 60 computers were handed out to Orchard Park parents. ""We will keep handing them out until we don't need to,"" said Abbey. She said computers are not being handed out just to families struggling financially, but also to those with children but only one computer. Abbey said face-to-face learning in a classroom is the ideal, but the school is trying to make the best of the current situation. ""Teachers are expressing to me that they are (making contact with students), and that the kids have been delighted to make contact. I certainly have been really warmed by the connections that I've made with these families."" DSBN spokeswoman Carolyn LoConte said the board recognizes not everyone has access to technology or the internet. ""It's a top priority for us to support all of our students and families, and to ensure that all students have the tools they need to learn from home during these school closures,"" she said. ""That's why we're equipping everyone who needs it with Chromebooks and access to Wi-Fi."" LoConte said Chromebook laptops allow students to go online and participate in learning platforms such as Brightspace, Google Classroom and D2L (Desire to Learn). They can also use a variety of applications on the cloud, so they don't need to purchase licences to access them. ""Over the last couple weeks, our schools have been reaching out to their families to find out who needs devices and Internet support, and we've been working quickly so students have the resources they need,"" she said. ""However, if students and families still require access to technology, they're encouraged to contact their school principal. We're here to support all of our students to successfully complete their year, and we're doing everything we can to make that happen."" John Crocco, education director for Niagara Catholic District School Board, said it has heard from many families during the past two weeks that students are ""eager"" to continue learning. ""As we switch the focus to teacher-led learning on Monday, we know that there will be some students who embrace this new way of learning and others who will find it challenging,"" he said. ""We will support all students as they adapt to this new learning style during the school closures."" Crocco said the board is finalizing distribution of laptops/end-point devices and access to the internet for students in need. ""If access cannot be achieved through a number of means, including community partnerships, we will explore avenues to provide access to curriculum through paper,"" he said. ""Niagara Catholic staff has been working around the clock to develop flexible plans to provide distance education to our students since the decision to close schools was made. Our plans will continue to adapt to meet this new learning and delivery style while schools are closed.""

The manor's executive director, William ter Harmsel, said he is waiting for the final green light from Niagara's health department, which declared an outbreak at the residence last week after a staff member tested positive for the potentially deadly virus. ""That staff member has been isolation for 14 days,"" ter Harmsel said Monday afternoon. ""So she has to have two negative tests before she is cleared. We are waiting for the test results and final word from the health department, because they are on the ones who make the final decision (about the outbreak status)."" Ter Harmsel said no residents have tested positive for COVID-19. While Albright is seeing the end of an outbreak, four other Niagara residences with COVID-19 are not so fortunate. Niagara acting medical officer of health Dr. Musfata Hirji said Monday many of 13 new confirmed novel coronavirus cases in Niagara are linked to their outbreaks. Seasons Retirement Community, Raplejie Lodge and Royal Rose in Welland, along with Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls, are coping with COVID-19 outbreaks. The extent of the outbreaks is not clear because the public health department is not disclosing the number of cases or deaths connected to the incidents. It is up to each residence to disclose that information. At Seasons there are nine active cases. Two residents who were sent to hospital for treatment after testing positive for COVID-19 recently died, said the company's chief executive officer. At Rapelje Lodge there is one confirmed case of COVID-19 in a staff member who is recovering in self-isolation, said Peter Criscione, communications consultant for Niagara Region, which operates the home. He said the Region has introduced a number of procedures at its eight long-term care homes in response to COVID-19. ""Ongoing testing of staff and residents is one of those heightened precautions,"" he said. Frequent testing across all facilities enables staff to act quickly to prevent further spread, he added. A spokesperson from Royal Rose did not respond to interview requests Monday. The state of COVID-19 outbreaks in Niagara nursing homes caught the attention of Ontario Premier Doug Ford who castigated Lundy Manor for holding a ""pub night"" for residents during a pandemic when physical distancing is being urged by public health officials. Tim Foster, of Oxford Living, which owns Lundy Manor, told The Niagara Falls Review on Sunday there have been deaths since the residence was put on outbreak status, but would not say how many, adding all numbers should come from public health. Hirji said an outbreak of COVID-19 is declared is there are two presumptive cases in a resident or one lab-confirmed case. - Fort Erie's Crescent Park Lodge dealing with 'rhinovirus' outbreak Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The St. Catharines business that typically produces items such as printed jerseys for sports teams has begun using its expertise and equipment to manufacture thousands of reusable cloth masks to protect people throughout North America from COVID-19. ""The sewers on the sewing machines that no one cared too much about three weeks ago are now superheroes saving lives. I love that,"" said the company's president, Marty Myers. ""Our staff have been great — extremely great. I know everybody's concerned."" Like many clothing companies, Myers said his business has outsourced some of its manufacturing, relying on workers in countries such as Bangladesh and China to produce the clothing it sells. However, Calhoun Sportswear also maintained a small sewing factory on Bunting Road — just in case it would ever be needed. ""It was just an anomaly that we even had one (a sewing factory),"" Myers said. ""But today, we know why we do have one."" As a result, he said the business and its workers have ""a huge opportunity to be able to help."" ""I've never been able to help the community like this before,"" he added. Myers said the two-ply cloth masks being produced in St. Catharines ""offer lots of protection,"" adding research done in the wake of the SARS outbreaks a decade ago had shown they are about 68 per cent effective — and they can be washed and reused. They are equipped with pockets, where additional filtration can be added significantly increasing their effectiveness — although Myers said in most cases the additional filters shouldn't be required. Myers said the goal is to produce as many as 10,000 masks daily, and the company is ramping up production to meet that target, recently adding new equipment. ""We're not there yet. There's demand for them and we're shipping stuff all over the U.S. and Canada,"" he said, adding the company is receiving orders from customers that include hospitals and cleaning companies. ""It's just not enough. Our focus is going to be on getting us up to 10,000 a day. We're going to be looking at bringing new sewers in, we're going to be calling some companies to help us."" For instance, he said, upholstery companies might have idle sewing machines that could be put to use making masks. But the inexpensive cost of the masks being produced — starting at less than $1 each — can be a disincentive for some manufacturers. ""The bottom line is there's no profit. We just felt we'd help out,"" he said. ""Right now we have to get cost-effective masks to the marketplace."" Myers said the company has implemented numerous precautions to protect the workers creating the masks, equipping each with masks of their own as well as smocks and other equipment. The facility and its offices have been closed to visitors. ""We want everybody to be healthy and safe. If you're sick, you're not coming into work,"" Myers said. If any of the workers were infected with COVID-19, he fears it could result in the factory closing entirely. Myers said it's not unlike how local businesses stepped up to help during military conflicts of the past.

It was issued in Niagara-on-the-Lake by a bylaw enforcement officer after several visits. ""Everything's about compliance, right?"" Lord Mayor Betty Disero said Tuesday. She added: ""Any non-essential business, or even the essential businesses that are not complying, will be ticketed or fined. As they should be. It's not about them, it's about the public."" Neither she nor town community and development services director Craig Larmour would identify the business where the fine was issued. However, Disero said she was told Niagara Regional Police had been to the Bass Pro Shops outlet in Niagara-on-the-Lake since the weekend. ""Yes, from what I heard the police had been there twice. Yes. Absolutely,"" she said, adding she didn't know the nature of the calls. Phone calls and emails to the store on Taylor Road and to Bass Pro's headquarters in Springfield, Mo., were not returned Monday or Tuesday. Its website and phone message indicate customers can still order items for same-day curbside pickup, but the store itself is closed to customers. The province's Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act was put in place to limit people's social contact and restrict the spread of COVID-19. On April 3, the province narrowed its list of essential workplaces to 44 from 74, ordering all others temporarily closed. Some — including those selling such items as pet supplies, hardware or safety gear — remain open only for curbside or delivery sales. It also limits crowds in public places to no more than five people. ""We've given advice to as many people as we can with our interpretation"" of the province's regulation 82-20, said Disero. ""We're trying to be as helpful as possible, we're trying to go through stages of education, warnings and when all else fails … we're giving fines."" As of late Tuesday neither of Niagara's largest municipalities, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls, had issued any fines against businesses. Closer to Toronto, only Mississauga was known to have fined a non-essential business for being open. Several municipalities fined individuals who ignored social distancing rules. While a provincial regulation, municipal bylaw officers are enforcing it. Across Niagara, city and town websites all provide information on how to contact bylaw enforcement departments to lodge a complaint. In Niagara-on-the-Lake, Larmour said, bylaw officers ""have been visiting stores and businesses that are open and helping them to determine whether or not they are essential businesses and allowed to open."" If they're non-essential but found open, he said, the officer provides them information on the province's order and advises them to close.

Essentially, if you don't comply we will be back to fine you on re-inspection."" At that point, he said, police will be asked to have an officer present as a fine is issued. He said the fine, set by the province at $750, would be issued to ""the person responsible for the store at that time."" ""It could be an owner, it could be a local manager. ""I would say the list of complaints is large, and we have issued a number of notices to a number of businesses"" but only one fine, he said. ""And we'll be back on a daily basis to ensure they are complying."" He said the town has received 50 to 60 complaints from the public regarding people not following social distancing rules or about businesses they felt are non-essential and should be closed.

Those four people were residents of Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls, the residence hit hardest by the novel coronavirus. There are currently 16 residents and four staff infected by COVID-19. ""It is not an easy time for anyone,"" said Tim Foster, vice-president at Oxford Living, the company that owns Lundy Manor. ""People, our staff and residents, are worried. We are doing everything can to keep them safe."" Niagara's public health department has declared COVID-19 outbreaks at Lundy Manor, along with Seasons Retirement Community, Royal Rose Place and Rapelje Lodge homes in Welland, last week. Albright Manor in Beamsville and Shalom Manor in Grimsby were declared to have outbreaks this week. Royal Rose Place, where six staff members and six residents are infected, is also trying to contain spread of the virus. ""In light of this, our team has taken immediate measures to further mitigate the possibility of transmission and to keep our residents and staff safe and healthy,"" said community relations co-ordinator Stephanie Barber in an email. ""We continue to work closely with public health and infection prevention and control specialists and are diligently following their directives."" There have been no deaths related to COVID-19 at the privately-owned long-term care home on Prince Charles Drive, but all residents have been placed in isolation until further notice. Residents remain in their rooms on their respective floors and are receiving meals through tray service, said Barber. Two residents of Seasons, where nine are currently infected, recently died while being treated at St. Catharines hospital for COVID-19. At Albright Manor, Rapelje and Shalom, a single staff member in each home tested positive for COVID-19 and are in isolation. In each case, the staff person was tested in late March and hasn't been in the home since. Johnathon Zwier, interim chief administrator at Shalom, said its staff person worked in the secure wing of the residence where people with dementia live. While no residents have tested positive, they are being isolated and monitored for symptoms. However, isolating residents with dementia can be challenging because they may not understand what is happening and have a tendency to wander off. Those who have wandering issues are being secured in their in rooms for 14 days, Zwier said. Dr. Mustafa Hirji, the region's acting medical officer of health, said many of the recently confirmed COVID-19 cases in Niagara are directly connected to outbreaks in the homes. An outbreak is declared when there are at least two presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the residence, or one confirmed case. Once an outbreak is declared, common areas are closed, enhanced cleaning protocols are enacted and visitors are barred. While residents can be declared recovered if they do not exhibit symptoms after 14 days, staff are required to have two tests that show a negative result for COVID-19 before they can return to work. The 34 current cases in the homes represent about 30 per cent of the total active COVID-19 cases in Niagara. There have been 10 deaths of people with COVID-19 in Niagara since the first case was discovered March 13. Nine of those people were being treated at St. Catharines hospital and one died at Lundy Manor. While Niagara Health reports the number of deaths of COVID-19 patients, the hospital system does not say if the virus was the sole cause of someone's death. - Lundy Manor employee speaks out about situation at retirement home Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The '80s rock or country and western tunes are a bit of a spirit-lifter for staff dealing with extra COVID-19 precautions and inpatients who can't have any visitors right now. ""Everybody kind of stops, takes a little dance in the hallway and just takes some time to pause and breathe,"" said chief nursing officer Jennifer Hansen. ""People really love it."" The centre on Glenridge Avenue has more than a hundred inpatients who are recovering from strokes and surgeries such as hip replacements. Hansen said staff are being extremely cautious due to the pandemic, but social distancing is a luxury they don't have in a health-care environment. Like at other facilities, they are in need of surgical masks. ""It doesn't matter where you work, the tension is very high and everybody's very careful with their infection control practices,"" she said. Hotel Dieu Shaver has not had any patients with COVID-19. Though there were some suspected cases, Hansen said they tested negative. The centre has multiple calls with the Niagara Health hospital system daily to talk about patients Hotel Dieu Shaver can take in to ensure there are enough beds available at St. Catharines hospital for potential COVID-19 patients. Hotel Dieu Shaver has been taking in patients every day who require rehabilitation. A large group is expected to be sent over from the hospital Thursday after being held in isolation for 14 days first as a precautionary measure. Patients are being discharged from Hotel Dieu Shaver when ready to go to their individual homes or retirement and long-term care homes, if those facilities are not experiencing an outbreak. ""A lot of it is business as usual, it's just a little bit of a different environment,"" Hansen said. She said staff are keeping their spirits up, but it's not nice for health-care workers when visitors can no longer come in. ""We understand how much people heal better when they have their family around. They're trying to do everything to keep their spirits high, which in turn will keep our patients' spirits high as well."" Patients have been offered the opportunity to FaceTime or Skype with family members. Pastoral workers and staff bring iPads to patients and assist families in trying to connect. Some families are also visiting loved ones inside the facility by standing outside the glass corridor linking the rehab centre and the inpatient centre. ""A lot of patients' families are coming with signs outside saying that they love them and it's very uplifting for them as well,"" Hansen said. ""If we are able to facilitate them going outside to see a loved one at a safe distance we try what we can do to make that happen for them.""

It has an average 40,000 a year. Some of those patients will be seen virtually or contacted by phone to learn exercises they can do from home.

Donations can be made to its foundation by emailing hdsfoundation@hoteldieushaver.org or by contacting Hansen at Hotel Dieu to get in touch with the right people. She said there has been a good response from community members, with people giving N95 masks from their home, making items on 3D printers and donating hand sanitizer.

The Niagara Falls theme park has purchased 2,000 KN95 protective face masks for Niagara Falls Fire Department, and facilitated the purchase of an additional 20,000 KN95 masks for Niagara Emergency Medical Services. The masks, provided by Canadian company FDK Supply Canada Inc., were delivered Tuesday. ""We are so proud of the work being done by front line workers to keep Niagara safe and wanted to do our part to help,"" said park owner Marie Holer, widow of Marineland founder John Holer. To get the masks, Marineland attorney Andrew Burns said he leaned on old contacts while serving on the province's SARS Commission in 2003. Once COVID-19 hit Canada, he was referred to a Canadian-owned company that makes LED lighting which was shifting gears to produce protective masks. ""We said, look, we have to try and help,"" said Burns, who helped convince the company to defer contracts with non-essential businesses to produce the masks for front-line workers. The company incorporated itself as FDK Supply Canada, Inc. this week, independent of its LED production. Looking to make a donation, Marineland was offered 2,000 masks to purchase. Burns then contacted Niagara Region about securing many more masks for EMS. ""Of course, everyone's desperate for masks,"" he said. ""I understood from the Region they literally didn't have any masks or they were running out."" The masks have to be fitted for each worker, and replacements will be brought in as necessary. All while worldwide demand for masks is soaring, said Burns. ""Every country in the world is fighting for these."" Because animals are under its care, Marineland has been declared an essential service by the province. While an opening date has not been set for the season, Holer said employees are doing ""everything we can to help keep people safe and to limit the spread of COVID-19."" - Items needed: Niagara Health puts out call for N95 masks, other equipment - The COVID-19 advice around masks has changed.

""We've seen such generosity since all of this began,"" said Carolyn Bones-Poley, executive director of the Niagara Falls food bank. ""We had a nine-year-old girl here last week who brought us 128 pounds of food because she just thought it was the right thing to do. We've just had so many instances of people that are digging deep to help others in the community and it just shows the strong spirit that Niagara Falls has."" Project Share also recently benefited from a donation by members of the Rotary Club of Niagara Falls Sunrise. Members donated funds to purchase food for the agency and bought pizza for the staff as a thank you for their work to help the most vulnerable people in the community. One of the members was able to go out and get much-needed items, including peanut butter, canned fruit and tuna, and macaroni and cheese. ""During this time, everyone needs support,"" said Dale Hall, president-elect of the club. ""Not only do those who use the services of Project Share, but also those providing the service."" Bones-Poley said the donation came at the perfect time, as Project Share was ""completely out"" of canned fruit. She said the food bank is currently operating without volunteers, which they typically are ""very reliant on."" ""We usually have anywhere from 10 to 20 volunteers in here in a day, as well as the 20 staff people that we also have. We've paused our volunteers in order to keep them safe. We've been operating on staff only since this happened. It's necessary because (the facility is) rather small and in order to keep social distancing and ensure that we have the safety precautions in place, we needed to . reduce the number of people in the building."" Monetary donations can be made to Project Share by visiting projectshare.ca/donate or by calling 905-357-5121. Because the Rotary club is not meeting on a weekly basis, members have decided to use their funds to provide meals for front-line workers. Club members usually meet on Thursdays at Betty's Restaurant for breakfast and weekly camaraderie. ""Rotarians are known as people of action, and with social-distancing measures in place, we need to adapt to this new normal,"" said Hall. ""Typically, Rotarians are physically active in the community, but we know spearheading a project right now isn't conducive to flattening the curve."" In addition to Project Share, the club recently supported the Canadian Mental Health Association and Detox Niagara. Food was brought to the two organizations and was provided by Counterpart Brewing in Niagara Falls. ""Not only are we looking to provide support to those working on the front line, we are also trying to support small-business owners in Niagara,"" said Hall. ""A lot of Rotarians are business owners, and we understand the need to support each other."" Tara McKendrick, executive director for the Niagara branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, said the donation is appreciated. ""We are grateful to the Rotary Club of Niagara Falls Sunrise and their members for redirecting their weekly meeting costs to show support to Niagara's front-line workers, including those on our team who are providing 24/7 mental-health support over the phone,"" she said. ""Every effort made by every person in our community is something to be grateful for. We are all in this together.""

Niagara's COVID-19 curve is showing real signs that it is starting to flatten, but the pandemic still poses serious risks, particularly to residents of long-term care homes and health-care workers, according to new data released by the region's public health department. Information released Wednesday shows that more than 26 per cent of all Niagara COVID-19 are residents of long-term care and retirement homes. A full 10 per cent of cases are local health-care workers — including doctors, nurses, personal support workers, and related support staff — have contracted the virus. But while data shows physical distancing and hand hygiene are tamping down the infection rate, Niagara's acting medical officer of health is concerned about cases that haven't been found. ""So long as there are those unknown unknowns out there, cases in the community that we haven't detected, there is a risk of further outbreaks,"" said Dr. Mustafa Hirji. ""That is why we are really urging those with mild symptoms to call us, so we can track down as many cases as we can and prevent further spread of the virus."" Overall, he said, the region's COVID-19 infection rate curve is showing signs of flattening, but cautioned this progress is fragile, which is why infection control measures and increased testing remains necessary. ""It took us two weeks to get to this point and it will take us a few more weeks (for the curve to decline),"" he said. ""We don't want that to be undone by cases that our there right now, by someone with only mild symptoms who has decided to just shrug it if off."" The health department has come under fire over the past few weeks for its limited release of information regarding the spread of COVID-19 in Niagara. Until Wednesday, Hirji was only releasing the total number of cases and how many people had recovered. Deaths related to COVID-19 were being released by the Niagara Health hospital system and long-term care homes. That changed Wednesday with the release of new data, including the number of deaths, demographics and data on infection rates. As of Wednesday, there had been 180 confirmed infections since the first case was detected March 13. Fifty-five people have recovered and 10 people with COVID-19 have died, nine of which died in hospital. That leaves Niagara with 115 active COVID-19 cases. The new data shows people older than 40 make up the vast majority of cases in Niagara, with those 60 and older comprising 52 per cent of total cases. Hirji said those numbers are being driven to a significant degree by COVID-19 outbreaks in six Niagara long-term care and retirement homes. While some, including Alright Manor in Beamsville, are dealing with a small outbreak — one staff member in that case is waiting for results of followup tests before being allowed to return to duty — others are in the grip of a grim reality. At Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls, at least 16 residents and at least four staff have contracted the virus. As of Tuesday, four residents with the virus had died. At Seasons Retirement Community in Welland, two infected residents have died and nine residents had COVID-19 as of Wednesday. As staff become sick and unable to work, a home's ability to care for its residents is compromised. Moreover, Hirji said, personal support workers have been vectors for COVID-19 to spread because many of them work in multiple homes on part-time or occasional hours. Some have gone to work when exhibiting mild symptoms. ""There are several factors why that is happening,"" Hirji said, citing low PSW pay as a reason why staff might go to work while ill. ""They depend on working at multiple homes to make ends meet, and even as we deal with this right now, this is an issue that perhaps we have to address as a society."" Data also shows the risk health workers face. Hirji said the 10 per cent of cases being health-care workers having COVID-19 is a reflection of the local outbreaks and, in some cases, the improper use of personal protective equipment including gloves, masks and gowns. Not wearing them the properly, unsafe reusing of the gear and improperly taking it off and disposing of it has contributed to infections, he said. Hirji said dealing with the local outbreaks is a top priority of public health, but there is a silver lining — outbreaks are confined to the homes and not contributing to the wider spread of the virus. - Impact of physical distancing in Niagara may soon be felt, says Hirji Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Canada Border Services Agency released statistics showing traveller movement since the Canadian federal government announced enhanced border measures related to foreign nationals on March 16 and the suspension of non-essential travel along the Canada-U.S. border on March 21 in response to the COVID-19 virus outbreak. Travel across the border of an optional or discretionary nature, including tourism and recreation, is not permitted while these restrictions remain in place. CBSA said during the week of March 30 to April 5, there was a 29 per cent decrease in truck drivers entering Canada compared to the same time last year, despite no measures in place to restrict commercial shipments or render certain products non-essential. CBSA said they have no indication of issues with supply chains for essential goods coming to Canada, including food and medical supplies. On April 5, travellers on U.S. flights were down 98 per cent and international air travellers were down 95 per cent compared to the previous year. Commercial traffic, however, remained strong with only a 24 per cent decrease. According to statistics posted to the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission website, there were 32,849 auto trips into Canada at the Rainbow Bridge in March - 37,127 into the U.S. That's down significantly from 83,063 auto trips into Canada and 95,276 into the U.S. in March 2019. A sharp decrease in March's numbers can start to be seen March 16, when the enhanced measures were put in place. March 1 saw 2,346 auto trips into Canada at the Rainbow Bridge - 2,985 into the U.S. March 31 saw 58 auto trips into Canada and 69 into the U.S. And with the Easter and Passover long weekend - a weekend that represents for many a time to be with family and friends - CBSA is reminding everyone restrictions remain in place. In a press release, CBSA advises travellers will be returned to the U.S. if they attempt to come to Canada for any of the following examples of non-essential travel: Visiting family, friends or a girlfriend, boyfriend or fianc�(e); attending a party or celebration; going to a restaurant for take-out; driving in transit for the purpose of taking a shortcut through Canada to get to a U.S. destination faster; sightseeing; fishing or hunting; and opening or checking on a cottage or seasonal home. CBSA reminds Canadians if they return to Canada from any foreign destination, they must self-isolate for 14 days, which means no social gatherings or shopping upon return. For more information on crossing the border during COVID-19, call the CBSA information line at 1-204-983-3500 or 1-506-636-5064 (outside Canada); 1-800-461-9999 (within Canada); or visit Canada.ca/coronavirus. Limited travel exemptions exist for healthy essential service workers that cross the border on a regular basis, such as truck drivers, firefighters and medical workers, as well as travellers who enter Canada to receive essential services such as medical care. Canadian citizens, permanent residents and Registered Indians under the Indian Act have a right to enter Canada, however, will be subject to COVID-19 entry screening measures, including the mandatory requirement to self-isolate in Canada for 14 days. - If Donald Trump turns the coronavirus pandemic into a trade war, Justin Trudeau knows just how to fight it Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

With the stress the outbreak has put on stores to remain open and employees to work extended hours, Loblaw and Shoppers Drug Mart outlets are looking to add staff. ""In order to keep things running smoothly, we need a full team in stores and distribution centres,"" said Mark Wilson, head of human resources for the chains, in a recent release. ""We also need to be able to give our current team a break. So we're inviting people to apply and we'll reach out if we need a hand restocking, supporting customers or just pitching in."" Anyone interested can apply at LoblawJobs.ca. That follows the recent announcement that online support centre Sitel Group plans to add more than 200 permanent and temporary workers for its St. Catharines operation. After short training sessions, those people would work from home. To apply, go to Jobs.Sitel.com and enter the keyword St. Catharines. NOTL winery pitches in for hand sanitizer effort Dillon's Small Batch Distillers, in Beamsville, has received widespread recognition for its effort to help stop the coronavirus. In mid-March, the company adapted quickly to use some of the alcohol it keeps on site to produce batches of hand sanitizer and disinfectant, which it distributed among front-line health-care and community workers. Now Diamond Estates Wines and Spirits has pitched in. The Niagara-on-the-Lake company has donated 24,000 litres of white wine to Dillon's, to be distilled into sanitizer. After the distilling process, that's expected to produce about 4,000 750-ml bottles of hand sanitizer. That will be shared by front-line workers in Ontario and British Columbia, on behalf of the Lakeview Wine Co. and Backyard Vineyards. Credit union offers help for groups providing food during outbreak PenFinancial Credit Union has donated $20,000 in emergency funding to help community groups that provide food for people in need during the COVID-19 outbreak. Citing job losses and layoffs families have dealt with, as well as the time it takes for government financial assistance to be delivered, PenFinancial chief executive officer Ken Janzen said there's an immediate need for help.

""They were so heartfelt. Little kids made cards and older people wrote notes. It was really wonderful,"" said Barbara Galbraith, a retired emergency department nurse. ""They were just wonderful words of encouragement,"" she said, while sharing a few of the messages. ""Stay strong … Take time for yourself … Hope you can find time to dance and sing during this."" Many of the messages were adorned with colourful decorations or rolled into scrolls and tied with ribbons. Galbraith has been a hobbyist and potter since retiring — shaping clay into beautiful items while also passing her knowledge and passion for the art to students at her Sparrow Pottery Studio in St. Catharines. But as the COVID-19 pandemic hit Niagara, she found a way to use her talent to offer comfort to nurses working on the front lines, while asking friends throughout the community to contribute too. Last week as the mugs she crafted were nearing completion, she reached out through social media, asking people to donate items to fill the cups, such as chocolate, specialty teabags and words of encouragement. ""Spread the love, not the virus,"" she wrote on Facebook, below a photograph of some of the mugs she created. ""The response was absolutely overwhelming,"" she said. In addition to numerous donations of chocolates and teabags, Galbraith said she received dozens of handmade cards and notes dropped off at her home — enough to ensure each mug was packed full of items to brighten the day for the nurses who would receive them. ""I was able to sometimes put three or sometimes four notes in each mug that came from people throughout the community,"" she said. ""It was really wonderful. It was a really neat project."" Although Galbraith started the project, she credits the community for making it meaningful for the nurses. ""It's not that I did it. Everybody jumped on board with it. It was the community, my Facebook friends,"" she said. ""I'm hoping it's a bright spot in their day."" Despite spending much of her career as an emergency department nurse, Galbraith — who retired prior to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic in the early 2000s — said she can't imagine what nurses today are going through now. ""This is a strange time. I don't think anyone has ever seen anything like this before,"" she said. However, Galbraith said her daughter followed in her footsteps, and is currently working as an emergency department nurse, too. In addition to concerns about the safety of her daughter and other health-care workers, Galbraith said the crisis is having a deeper impact on medical staff which inspired her to do what she could to help. ""I think there's an emotional toll on the nurses and it goes further than the disease. That's why I felt it was really important to support them,"" she said. In addition to caring for patients from a medical perspective, Galbraith said nurses are being called on to provide the emotional support that isolated patients would typically receive from friends and family. ""In these times nobody is allowed in other than the patient. You know what, that's really tough for the nurses,"" she said. ""Not only do they provide the physical support, but the emotional support as well."" While Galbraith has used her talent for pottery to at least help brighten the day for nurses, she said everyone has something they can contribute — even if it's just a note of encouragement from a grateful member of the community.

For kids, it must seem like the end of the world. Not necessarily, said Brock University professor of child and youth studies Rebecca Raby. ""This is playing out differently with different children,"" she said. ""It depends on how old they are, where they live and what their family situation is. ""Some families and some kids are going to get hit hard if they have one parent isolating, or if they have a single parent, or if they are living in very small spaces. ""Some are more prone to anxiety or have disabilities and have benefited from supports they aren't getting. There are lots of challenges."" At the same time, some kids are going to do really well, Raby said. In some instances, children are spending more time with their parents and getting more attention than they do regularly. ""Sometimes, being bored can lead to kids finding interesting and creative things to do. Other kids suddenly realize they like going to school."" Regardless of the circumstances, Dr. Andrea Feller, Niagara's associate medical officer of health, has made a series of short videos packed with information on communicating to help kids through the COVID-19 crisis. The videos are available on Niagara's Region website or YouTube channel. Feller said parents can reassure children by letting them know there are a lot of doctors, nurses and scientific experts working on getting a handle on the coronavirus. Listening is also vital and an opportunity to correct anything that they have wrong. She also tells parents not to neglect themselves. ""We talk a lot about checking your own oxygen mask first, and recognizing if you are feeling anxious,"" Feller said. ""Wait until you are sure you are feeling calm and confident and then have the conversation."" Feller also suggested returning children's sense of control by telling them they are unlikely to get very sick and reminding them they play a role in staying healthy and helping others do the same. ""We want physical distance, but we don't want emotional distance,"" she said. Raby said news reports on the dramatic rise in calls to Kids Help Phone spurred her research team of six graduate students to launch an online study of children's and young people's experiences at home during the pandemic.

""We value our seasonal residents greatly as members of this community, but we are asking cottagers, secondary homeowners and seasonal residents to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by staying in their primary residence,"" he said. The mayor said it's crucial that everyone follows advice of medical experts to curb travel because of the increased chances of infection from the virus. A number of seasonal properties along the Lake Erie shoreline are owned by American residents. They have been unable to visit since mid-March after U.S. and Canada agreed to temporarily restrict all non-essential travel across the border. Other properties are Canadian-owned. Niagara Regional Police have been conducting directed patrols of seasonal residences in the south end of the region, also including Port Colborne and Wainfleet. ""We have not seen an uptick in the property-related crimes as it relates to the seasonal cottages,"" said Const. Phil Gavin. He said local residents are in ""close communication"" with neighbours who are unable to check on their properties. ""There is also a very strong cottage community looking out for one another,"" he said. ""The fellow cottage owners are looking out for each other."" Fort Erie, which closed its boat launches last week except for emergency purposes and rescues by approved agencies, reminded people that gatherings of more than five people are illegal in Ontario during the crisis.

Events have proven Dr. Mustafa Hirji was right to be concerned. Saturday, the Lundy Manor retirement home in Niagara Falls reported six more residents with novel coronavirus had died, bringing its total to 10. All six new death occurred at St. Catharines hospital over the past week. The virus has infected 21 residents and five employees. ""Unfortunately, the long-term care homes are a terrible nexus,"" Hirji said. ""It is an environment where the virus can be relatively easily spread. It is also an environment where people can have underlying medical conditions and are going to be susceptible to these kinds of illnesses. ""One thing we know about COVID-19 over the past three and a half months around the world, is that it really seems to impact elderly people the most."" Hirji said the residents at long-term care homes often live in confined quarters with staff going between rooms, creating an environment for transmissions. Hirji said while the overall rate of COVID-19 infections appears to be slowing in Niagara, long-term care home hot spots account for nearly 27 per cent of the region's confirmed cases. Tim Foster, vice-president of Oxford living which owns Lundy Manor, offered the company's ""deepest condolences"" to friends and family of those who died. In a statement, Foster said the home is continually updating its procedures as new orders, directives and guidance are communicated to the retirement home industry. ""We continue to work closely with Niagara Region Public Health, the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority and government officials to address the situation,"" Foster said the home has implemented heightened safety protocols, including physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and restricting visits to essential personnel. ""We brought in a third party hospital-grade sterilization/sanitization company to treat symptomatic resident rooms and common areas,"" he said. The hospital reported an additional three deaths of COVID-19 patients Saturday — two people from Welland and one from Niagara Falls. The hospital did not say if any of the patients were from Lundy Manor or the other five Niagara long-term care homes that have COVID-19 outbreaks, including three in Welland. - Niagara Falls long-term residence staff greeted by loving ovation of thanks - St. Catharines hospital worker contracts COVID-19 Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Niagara Region Public Health reported 136 confirmed cases of the virus as of noon Sunday. Of the new cases, nine are travel related, five being travel to the United States, said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara's acting medical officer of health. Fourteen are contacts of known confirmed cases, nine are community transmissions, and five are still under investigation. ""We're not yet reporting deaths,"" he said, adding that probably will be done starting this week. Hirji said public health will likely only release the number of total deaths but will not begin identifying which municipalities those deaths or confirmed cases are from. ""We're trying to give information I think the public deserves to know about, while also balancing that when there are small numbers, it, unfortunately, can compromise privacy because people are able to figure out who individuals are,"" he said. ""Fortunately, we have not had a large number of deaths in Niagara, at least by an absolute number, so we're conscious that we can't give out any kind of breakdowns of those deaths right now."" Hirji, however, did say COVID-19 is not an isolated problem, and that municipalities across the region have been impacted. ""We have confirmed cases in every municipality in Niagara and we have had deaths in multiple municipalities."" The 136 confirmed cases reflect Niagara residents and of those, 30 have recovered. ""We capture whoever is a Niagara resident and has been diagnosed with COVID-19, so whether they were diagnosed in hospital, long-term care home, in the community through their family physician and, even if someone was say, for example, in Thunder Bay but happened on file to be a Niagara resident, we would still get legally notified about them,"" said Hirji. Outbreaks have been declared at five homes, including Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls; Douglas H. Rapelje Lodge, Royal Rose Place and Seasons First Avenue in Welland; and Albright Manor in Beamsville. As of Sunday, Niagara Health was reporting the death of seven patients (same number as Friday) who tested positive for COVID-19, however, it does not mean COVID-19 was the cause of death. The hospital system said it had tested 2,210 patients for COVID-19 - 107 came back positive. That's up from Friday, when Niagara Health reported 1,939 patients had been tested, with 103 coming back positive. It said 34 patients with the virus have been admitted to date, with 21 currently being treated. That's up from 25 patients, with 13 being treated, on Friday. Niagara Health said results may differ from public health due to the timing of collection of the data.

Glen Walker, executive director of Positive Living Niagara, said protective equipment such as masks, goggles, gowns and gloves are being used by staff as they visit clients across the region five nights a week dropping off clean needles on local doorsteps and through windows. ""We haven't really seen a dropoff in demand,"" Walker said Monday about the StreetWorks harm-reduction program that serves about 1,300 registered clients. Deliveries are made in two vans and volunteers are not participating in them, Walker said. At the safe injection site operated at Positive Living Niagara on Queenston Street in St. Catharines, changes are also being made, even though the site continues to be open seven days a week, 12 hours a day. ""For the most part, it's been very busy,"" said Walker. Injection booths have been reduced to three from four and one chair is available in the waiting area. This means no more than five people using the site for consumption are indoors at a time, along with two Niagara Emergency Medical Services staff, two counsellors, a peer worker and a security guard — all well-equipped with protective gear, said Walker. People who visit the site are screened at the door and small lineups have formed most days, he said. An ""isolation room"" has been created for when someone comes to the door showing symptoms of the coronavirus. They are kept there until they can be taken to hospital or an assessment centre for testing. This has occurred twice, but Walker said it is his understanding that neither individual ended up testing positive. Many of the men and women who use the safe injection site are homeless. Raising awareness of the virus and need to take preventative measures to keep clear of COVID-19 is something Positive Living is ""very concerned"" with, said Walker. ""Our fear is that once someone in that population gets infected, it will spread like wildfire,"" he said. ""One of our biggest challenges is getting people to understand the need for all of this."" Meanwhile, border restrictions are also having an impact on drugs like heroin making their way into the area. This is causing new ""really potent mixtures"" that are resulting in a steady number of overdoses during the pandemic. ""People are overdosing who normally don't,"" said Walker. Another challenge Positive Living is facing is working around its usual recommendation to clients that they not use hard drugs while by themselves. It's been a real ""balancing act"" encouraging this with distancing rules at the same time. ""If you use alone and you overdose, you die,"" he said. - Activists fear for safety of people with disabilities after funding for mobility and medical devices deemed non-essential Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

About 20 people with the Niagara-on-the-Lake theatre company are cutting and sewing and staying busy cranking out about 400 masks and garments per week for front-line workers. Executive director Tim Jennings said it's a way for the company to use its talent while waiting — and hoping — for the 2020 season to start. The company has cancelled shows to June 30 and is keeping its 400 members on payroll until at least April 19. ""What's important about keeping everybody on payroll and continuing to work … is how useful and productive that feels in a world where things aren't useful and productive currently,"" he said. ""There's a real hope, a real optimism about it, that I find very powerful for all of us."" Jennings' wife Truly Carmichael is among the cutters who doesn't just help make the hospital-approved patterns, but drops them off at homes afterwards. Shaw Festival has donated the fabric. Cutters, designers and seamstresses then combine to make the garments and masks, much as they would the elaborate costumes for the season. ""It started off with what we had in stock, things we bought,"" Jennings said. Last week, the company's wardrobe head and production director ordered more rolls of fabric to keep up with demand. With a laugh, Jennings said many of the stitchers want to do ""all the little fancy things they normally do."" ""All the things the Shaw is known for in terms of quality. But really, this is just about speed and making sure it's not a frayed edge at the bottom."" Jennings feels the endeavour again shows the bond between Shaw Festival and Niagara, even as the pandemic has put a halt to live theatre and other events. ""Just because we're in the arts doesn't mean we can't help the (people) on the front line,"" he said.

Ann Mantini-Celima, executive director of the non-profit organization that serves all of Niagara with a number of coping and support services, said its headquarters in Fonthill has been closed for weeks. But staff and volunteers are making sure the people who need them are only a couple of mouse clicks away. The way in which programs are being offered online isn't set in stone, she said. ""We're changing them every week, building them up based on members' feedback,"" she said. Wellspring Niagara is also partnering with its affiliate in Toronto to deliver programs. Clients who do not have access to the internet are being reached by phone. Anyone with questions and concerns, or in need of someone to talk to, is encouraged to call and leave a voicemail. It won't take long for someone to call back, said Mantini-Celima. ""We're checking messages all the time."" The global health crisis is just another cause of concern for people affected by cancer. ""They were already dealing with a lot of anxiety, stress, fear before all of this happened,"" Mantini-Celima said. ""This is a double-whammy for some of our members."" Clients, current and new, can reach out by phone or find information about program scheduling at wellspring.ca. ""We want people to know we're here for them."" The pandemic is giving cancer patients and their families something else to cope with, but most appear to be glad Wellspring Niagara hasn't ceased operations in recent weeks, she said. ""They are appreciative, at least, that we are doing something, and they have a way of staying connected."" Wellspring Niagara has close to 1,000 members. Membership forms for new clients are available on Wellspring Niagara's website. Its phone number is 905-684-7619. Mantini-Celima said the organization will continue to adapt to the pandemic as it evolves. - The webcam will see you now: Doctors prescribing care online Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

After 12 residents of Lundy Manor had died as of Monday, with 22 residents and five staff members confirmed to have COVID-19, both Niagara Centre MPP Jeff Burch and Niagara Falls MPP Wayne Gates called on the provincial government to investigate the facility's response to the crisis in the hope that future tragedies can be averted. ""It's unfortunate that a lot of our long-term care facilities were not ready and prepared, both in terms of transparency with the families of residence, and with practices in the home,"" Burch said. ""We want to make sure we understand exactly what has happened not just a Lundy Manor but in other places, and not just because the families deserve to know, but for the future so we can be better prepared to handle these issues."" He said Lundy Manor is one of several retirement and long-term care homes that have been hard hit by the pandemic that were not observing best practices to protect residents. Burch's office contacted Seniors and Accessibility Minister Raymond Cho, Health Minister Christine Elliott and Long-Term Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton requesting the investigation. Gates said he has called on Labour Minister Monte McNaughton to look into the home as well, also concerned about the health and well-being of its workers. ""I've had co-operation with all the ministers on this particular place,"" he said. ""I believe procedures weren't followed leading up to the outbreak."" Tim Foster, vice-president of strategy and business development for Lundy Manor's owner, Oxford Living, said the company is continuing to work closely with Niagara Region Public Health and the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority. ""As you can appreciate, this an extremely difficult time for Lundy Manor (as it is for a great many retirement homes and long-term care homes across the Province). Please note, however, that we are doing everything in our power to protect the health and safety of our residents,"" Foster said in an email. ""We are proud of our entire Lundy Manor staff through this entire situation — these men and women have showed bravery, dignity and grace from the moment we learned of our first presumptive positive case of COVID-19."" The MPPs said systemic problems with long-term care and retirement homes have aggravated the response to the current crisis. ""We've been fighting for a long time for minimum hours of care and less precarious work for our PSWs (personal support workers),"" Burch said. ""Right now, we have PSWs that need two or three part-time jobs and they're going between different homes and workplaces, and there's a shortage because they're not being paid properly. They don't have benefits they should. ""Unfortunately, we're paying for it now because we didn't pay proper attention to front-line health-care workers in the past,"" he added. Gates said legislation will be required to address underlying problems with retirement homes, such as support for PSWs and proper equipment, and putting the focus on the care of residents rather than profit. ""They're some of the most vulnerable people in society and they're our parents, our grandparents, they're our aunts and uncles,"" Gates said. ""They built this great country and they deserve the best possible care they can in their senior years.""

But the pickings are slim, and local job placement specialists aren't hiding the fact. ""We have our finger on the pulse of the marketplace in Niagara, and that pulse is very weak right now,"" said Marina Butler, president of Employment Professionals Canada. ""The employment picture is definitely bleak right now,"" added Rebecca Nicholls, manager of community employment for Niagara College Community Employment Services. ""We are still hearing from employers that might be hiring,"" she said. ""It's not in droves, that's for sure, it might be one or two positions here and there."" Nicholls estimated the number of jobs available now is about 60 per cent less than it would normally be at this time of year. Last week, a monthly jobs report by Statistics Canada showed that by the third week of March about 11,000 people in Niagara lost their employment as non-essential businesses were ordered closed. Across Canada, about 1.1 million people were without work, and as of this week nearly 5.5 million had applied for emergency federal aid. Butler's offices, in Thorold and Fort Erie, and Nicholls' office in St. Catharines are closed but continuing to provide employment services and counselling online. Aside from Sitel Group, which is adding about 200 call centre positions to work from home, all the other job postings are sporadic, said Nicholls. She said there is a small mix of permanent and temporary jobs available in retail, data collection, nursing homes where part-time staff are no longer allowed to work in multiple homes, and some grocery and pharmacy positions. Also agriculture — ""They're about to enter their busy period with not a lot of opportunity to recruit foreign workers, as they normally would. So agriculture has seen a huge uptick,"" said Nicholls. And, she added, ""We are seeing some uptick in delivery drivers, which is probably not surprising as a lot of establishments are working toward only delivery or curbside pickup."" Anecdotally, she said, her office is hearing some businesses that didn't provide delivery previously are learning it might be a feature they want to keep. ""So perhaps it could lead to long-term (employment), because now they're thinking that's another avenue of business that they didn't need to think of before."" Employers are calling in, she said, but they are looking for information on government wage subsidies and incentives to assist with hiring ""so when that essential services list is (expanded) they'll be ready to go."" Last year, Butler said, employers had a hard time finding employees to fill all their available jobs.

She expects in a month or so, ""it will be a different environment."" She said, ""Once everybody has the restored confidence, it will turn around quickly because everybody will want to make up for lost time."" Some sectors such as tourism and some services will recover more slowly, she said. ""I think construction will rev up, and manufacturing, because suppliers will have to be up and going for construction to take place,"" Butler said.

""Missing part of this summer will be devastating to many businesses unless the government gets more involved,"" said Greg Poisson. Poisson and his wife, Rosemari, own Canalside Pub and Eatery, Canalside Kitchen Store and Canalside Inn. ""We've seen a 90 per cent drop in business,"" he said, adding the kitchen store is closed and there are no rentals at the inn. There's very little in the way of restaurant sales, but Poisson said the couple appreciate the local support as many residents are making an effort to help restaurants, including theirs. ""It's still not enough to maintain the bills."" All 20 employees who work at the business have been laid off. Poisson said unless the restaurant is completely shut down, which they don't want to do, the couple aren't eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Poisson said the struggle for West Street and other businesses in the community will be a lack of seasonal residents and tourists. He said it's already been a big hit. Rob Carter and Brennon Zwingli, owners of The Pie Guys Bakery and Cafe, said their West Street business has been impacted by the pandemic and they've had to get innovative and rethink their business model. ""We had a very brisk business with a steady footfall so the biggest challenge was to think about how can we re-create the number of transactions in a day when foot traffic is down 75 per cent."" The two have scaled back operations to three days a week from seven and have managed to capture nearly 70 per cent of their previous business with just a few small changes. Those changes include placing the daily lunch menu on hold and replacing it with hot entrees that change daily. They also offer free, local full delivery service for baked goods, the daily entrees, frozen entrees or fruit and savoury pies, which has been critical to keeping the business that opened in 2018 moving forward. Carter and Zwingli started a Bakery Box Program that has made more than 50 deliveries a day, with 75 per cent being sent to someone else other than the person ordering. ""What's critical for all business owners is to understand the world has changed and you must now adapt, and change with it. What once was, will maybe no longer be, so take this time to re-create who you are and how you fit into this new reality we have all found ourselves in."" Judith Boroniec, owner of Talwood Manor Bed and Breakfast, has been greeting and accommodating people from every corner of the world for the past 16 years. She said if she was a new business now, there's no way she could manage to stay open. With her main business early spring to late autumn, Boroniec said there were numerous reservations right through until early March. The business averages 500 reservations a year. ""Now business is nonexistent, no online reservations, no calls for bookings even for later this year. No one is travelling at this time and we're not accepting guests even though rooms have been disinfected. We want to be a part of the solution to flatten the curve and lessen exposure."" While her business has taken a financial hit, Boroniec estimated her guests would spend somewhere between $55,000 and $65,000 a year through dining out alone. ""Financially, it will be a writeoff as there is no way to recoup lost days even if I did reinvent my business. Mine is a business related to people and experiences. None of which is happening now and, I believe, not for a long while."" She has encouraged people who have cancelled staying with her to rebook or buy gift certificates for later use, but said people are too frightened to consider travel far in advance. ""It's uncertainty, especially that many have had their disposable income wiped out due to job layoffs or losing the job altogether. I do have some bookings in the early fall, but we will need to see how things work out."" - Niagara T-shirt campaign helps businesses struggling with COVID-19 closures Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The investigation, which began Tuesday, is expected to produce a report by Friday. Marko Mrmak, a corrections officer at the jail and president of OPSEU Local 252, said prior to the COVID-19 pandemic when guards asked for masks to search dorms and cells, search inmate clothing or conduct strip searches, ""there was no problem."" ""Now all of a sudden, we are in a pandemic and those requests are being denied,"" he said. While there are two inmates in isolation because they meet criteria of having potentially been exposed to the novel coronavirus before they were arrested, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases at the jail among staff or inmates. However, Mrmak said other jails have had some positive cases and ""they are going through some pretty rocky times right now."" ""We are trying to be a bit proactive to prevent the spread of the virus in the institution,"" he said. ""We are the ones who leave here every day and go home and then come back."" Four guards refused to do a search Wednesday without the masks and that work refusal resulted in the ministry investigation. According to a statement from the ministry posted at the jail Tuesday evening, the detention centre administrators said they are screening staff, doing enhanced cleaning and are rationing N95 masks. The document was signed by representatives from the ministry and detention centre management. A member of the jail's joint-health and safety committee also signed it, but under his signature wrote ""signing in disagreement."" Comments from the Ministry of the Solicitor General were not immediately available Thursday. Mrmak said screening used up to Thursday was just a statement from an officer that he or she had no new symptoms connected with COVID-19. That process is changing Friday morning, when a more robust screening questionnaire will be used, and the temperature of officers will be taken. ""If you don't hit all those check marks you can't go to work,"" Mrmak said. Some asymptomatic people, including staff in Niagara long-term care homes struggling to manage COVID-19 outbreaks, have tested positive for the virus, driving up the number of cases in Niagara Wednesday to 320 since the first infection was found March 13. That someone without symptoms could be contagious is heightening concerns amongst guards, Mrmak said. Other jails are dealing with COVID-19 cases, including the Windsor jail, Mrmak said. And on Thursday, Correctional Service Canada announced the first federal inmate who had COVID-19 died in British Columbia. And three correctional officers in Brampton have tested positive. Mrmak said while guards are worried they could contract the virus from inmates, those inmates are concerned about the guards infecting them. ""I don't think anyone in this institution, officers to inmates, are on a different page on this issue,"" he said. That concern was on display at the St. Catharines courthouse during Thursday bail hearings. A Niagara Falls man who had his hearing postponed on 17 criminal charges, including weapons offences, said it is ""highly inhumane"" to be behind bars due to the pandemic.

""I have asthma,"" the 27-year-old said. ""I'm so prone to getting it (COVID-19) and it's not fair to me."" Persaud, who was arrested March 23 following a break-in at Bass Pro Shops in Niagara-on-the-Lake, said he realizes he's facing ""serious allegations,"" but was willing to represent himself at his bail hearing if it meant it would expedite the proceedings. The judge warned him it would be in his best interest to have his counsel present during the hearing. Persaud is expected to return to court, via audio conference from the Thorold jail, on April 20 for a bail hearing. On March 23, according to a news release issued by Niagara Regional Police, a man smashed a glass window out of a garage door at the Taylor Road store, next to the Outlet Collection at Niagara mall, then left in pickup truck without entering the store. The suspect returned five hours later and forced his way into the store. He fled the scene in the same pickup after grabbing five firearms and other merchandise. Investigation revealed the truck had been stolen from Toronto. Police located the vehicle at a Dixon Street home on March 24. The stolen firearms and other Bass Pro items were recovered from the home.

Through its DSBN Cares initiative, formed to show solidarity for local health heroes, an estimated $40,000 worth of personal protective equipment has been donated to Niagara Health Foundation. Staff combed through service centres and schools to gather the surplus gear, said a news release from DSBN Thursday. The donation includes gloves, N95 masks, sanitizer and other equipment to help keep Niagara Health hospitals staff and physicians safe. Board chair Sue Barnett said the expression ""we're all in this together"" was top of mind when arranging the gesture. ""Every person, every organization has an important role to play in slowing the spread of the (COVID-19) virus and keeping our community safe,"" she said. ""We're very proud to do what we can to support Niagara Health, and by extension, our students, families and larger community."" DSBN is making an additional contribution of $50,000 to Niagara Health Foundation to help purchase resources needed to care for patients. This donation was made possible through fundraising efforts of the DSBN International Concussion Summit. Public dollars for student learning were not part of this contribution, DSBN said in its release. Education director Warren Hoshizaki said he's grateful to students and staff for making this donation possible. ""DSBN students and staff are integral members of their communities. They regularly show good citizenship by organizing community cleanups, food drives and volunteering to support important causes. This is a time of great need in our community and, once again, our students and staff have found a way to show their support,"" he said. Roger Ali, president and chief executive officer of the hospitals foundation, said his organization is grateful for the support. ""During these difficult times, the foundation continues to carry out its work supporting our medical teams and hospitals, which is becoming more critical by the day. This donation will help purchase life-saving equipment, that will help front-line staff respond to COVID-19.""

Organizations that support the most vulnerable residents in Niagara communities will receive additional support, too, with a $25,000 grant for United Way Niagara's COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund. Niagara Community Foundation executive director Bryan Rose announced the funding in a media release, while lauding the organizations for the work being done. ""COVID-19 is having an impact on charities in every sector that we serve. The work they do is more vital now than ever before and the Foundation recognizes how important it is for us to support these agencies,"" he said. ""We'll continue to work with our charity partners on the front lines to learn how best we can support them, now and in the long term."" Money earmarked for essential hospital equipment includes $250,000 from the Niagara Community Foundation's David S. Howes Fund, as well as $20,000 from the Niagara-on-the-Lake Healthcare Community Fund and the Niagara Falls Healthcare Flow-Through Fund. Calling it a ""critical time in our community,"" Niagara Health Foundation president and chief executive officer Roger Ali said the donation and ""urgently needed equipment"" being purchased with it ""will directly impact patients being cared for with COVID-19 in our community."" The organization says the donations will provide frontline healthcare workers across Niagara with the equipment they need to help ensure the community remains safe and cared for. Meanwhile, the emergency $25,000 Strategic Initiatives Grant to the United Way will help the organization's member agencies better respond to the basic needs of Niagara's most vulnerable residents. Other philanthropic organizations are stepping up to the plate as well, including the Branscombe Family Foundation which pledged $25,000 to the United Way. United Way Niagara executive director Frances Hallworth said the donations have helped the organizations meet even the basic need for food in the community. ""Our first priority amidst this pandemic is the well-being of every single person in Niagara,"" she said in a media release. ""We are working as fast as we can to get food into the homes of people who need it most."" Rose said the Niagara Community Foundation will continue to ""collaborate with charities and other funders to support the emerging needs of our community.""

To date, no fines have been handed out and the local government is focusing on ""education"" about the important measure all levels of government are urging Canadians to take. Asked if fines would be handed out if an infraction is noticed, Khan said that is not part of the municipality's current plan as it stands today. ""I haven't been given any direction from upper management yet. We'll stick with the status quo and follow our education strategy,"" he said. If bylaw staff comes across a group of five people or more, they will be approached and asked to ""disperse,"" said Khan, adding this is something that has occurred in Welland. ""We have done that in the last couple of weeks,"" he said. But Rose City residents are adhering to the advice being given to them - to not form in large groups and to keep a distance of at least two metres from others while out of the house, Khan says. ""I'm proud to say Wellanders are co-operating. They're listening,"" he said. A region-wide hotline has been set up for the public to file complaints about improper physical distancing. Concerns are forwarded to respective municipalities and Niagara Regional Police if a matter of public safety is determined to be a factor. Khan said some calls have been made in Welland, but not a lot. ""It's not by any means in the hundreds - or even tens,"" he said. Some complaints have been followed up on, he also said. Earlier this week, the NRP said no fines had been handed out across Niagara. The initial fine mandated by the province is $880. NRP spokesman Const. Phil Gavin said some tickets have been handed out by municipalities, but he did not have information on where in the region this has taken place. Khan attributes the high rate of compliance to the city's own efforts, but also the media and upper levels of government. ""The message is from the PM's office, to the premier's office, to the mayor's office,"" he said. Khan also said no businesses have been fined in Welland during the pandemic. - Port Colborne adjusts bylaw enforcement strategy Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Thursday, John Chemilian, a property management manager and group public relations director for Markham-based JD Development, dropped the masks off at Welland Civic Square. They were picked up by Mayor Frank Campion and economic development director Dan Degazio before being taken to the Welland hospital. ""I thank John and Julia (Zhang, JD Development's chief executive officer) for their generosity and their interest in helping us out here in Welland,"" said Campion. ""I am really happy that they will be helping our frontline workers in a meaningful way."" Chemilian said it's not the first donation the company, primarily known for building highrise student accommodation, has made to help frontline workers in the province. He said masks imported from China before the pandemic have been donated in Barrie, Stouffville, Waterloo and Cambridge. ""We had 15,000 masks and were expecting more,"" he said, adding some of the masks ordered after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic made it through to the company. Chemilian's firm doesn't have any developments in the Rose City, but had been looking to build affordable housing and student residences. He said the proposed projects didn't materialize, but that's not to say there won't be something in the future. Campion said the city has developed a great relationship with the development company over the past few years. Niagara Health Foundation president and chief executive officer Roger Ali called it ""truly heartwarming to see this act of kindness."" As of Wednesday, the foundation said, 8,868 N95 masks, 2,866 gowns, 1,411 face shields, 122,698 pairs of gloves and 13,135 procedure masks had been donated to the health system.

Although a novel coronavirus vaccine is likely a year away, the health department is starting to stock up on equipment necessary for a mass immunization program. ""We are slowly preparing for a point next year when we are going to immunize the 450,000 people living in Niagara, or a great proportion of them,"" said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, the region's acting medical officer of health. ""We know when the time comes, there will be a tremendous global demand for needles and syringes just as there is currently a demand for testing materials. So we are working on stocking up so that we will be ready."" The health department has what Hirji called the ""skeleton"" of an immunization plan in place. Prior to the arrival of COVID-19, it was working on how to enact a vaccine program in the event of a flu or H1N1 pandemic. That plan is being updated so the health department is ready to launch once a vaccine becomes publicly available. Hirji said a vaccine is the best way to an end to the threat of COVID-19, which he said ""is going to be with us now forever and ever."" ""It is not going away."" How to face the future is something Hirji said is something that must be talked about now, particularly when the growth of COVID-19 cases in Niagara appears to be stabilizing. ""It's a question of what triggers an easing of restrictions and what kind of risk we, as a society, are willing to take. And that is something I think we need to start talking about now,"" he said. Niagara had another 18 cases of COVID-19 confirmed Monday, the majority of them related to outbreaks in five long-term care and retirement homes. That brings the total number of cases in Niagara to 384 since the first case was found in St. Catharines on March 13. Cases in long-term care homes make up about 33 per cent of the total number of cases. Health-care workers now comprise 20 per cent of cases, with most of them connected to the homes outbreaks. The number of new cases connected to travel or other kinds of community transmission have fallen into the single digits, something Hirji said was made clear in Sunday's case data when only two new Niagara cases were confirmed. The product of the lag in waiting for recent test results from homes with outbreaks, Sunday's numbers nonetheless showed how much the spread of the virus slowed down in the larger community thanks to physical distancing and hygiene measures. Neither case was connected to the outbreaks. While Niagara's COVID-19 curve is flattening out, Hirji said he is not willing to sound the all-clear. ""I wouldn't even consider that until the situation in the long-term care and retirement homes improves,"" he said. ""And while the numbers in the community are low, there are still cases out there, and if we don't remain vigilant those cases can start to multiply quickly."" Even so, he said now is a time to start talking about start taking steps back toward normalcy, even if it will come in a staggered approach. That approach might lean on determining who is immune to the virus since those who have recovered will have developed antibodies that should prevent a repeat infection. Methods like a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR test, which detects the remnants of a virus in someone's body, can help public health determine how widespread immunity might be. Hirji said there is work ongoing to directly test for COVID-19 antibodies, but those tests are not reliable enough yet. - Ontario announces $20-million investment in search for COVID-19 vaccine, a year after major cuts to health policy and research Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

Seasons Retirement Community chief executive officer Mike Lavallée said staff at the Welland home have been ""diligent in protecting the health and safety of our residents and their fellow team members."" ""They are truly front-line heroes,"" he said. Seasons is one of five long-term care homes in the Region coping with outbreaks of COVID-19 with cases among both residents and staff. Other hard-hit homes include Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls and Royal Rose Place in Welland. Garden City Manor in St. Catharines and Albright Manor in Beamsville have outbreaks but of a less serious nature. Lavallée said Seasons had a total of 17 cases of the virus among its residents. ""I am pleased to report that two resident cases were declared resolved over the weekend,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have had five residents pass away which brings our current total to 10 active resident cases."" Staff at the home have been hard hit, too. Nine workers have confirmed cases of the virus, while 34 had negative test results. ""We continue to work collaboratively with Niagara Region Public Health, as the health and safety of our staff and residents remains our greatest priority,"" Lavallée said. Oxford Living chief revenue officer Tim Foster said all residents and staff at Lundy Manor have been tested for the virus, as the home continues to work closely with the health department and the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority ""to control the spread of this virus and safeguard our residents and staff."" ""In total, there are currently 41 residents and eight staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19. Twelve residents who contracted the virus and went to hospital have since returned to Lundy,"" he said in an email. ""Unfortunately, seven remain in hospital at this time."" He said the virus has claimed the lives of 15 residents, ""including three in recent days who had been in hospital for the past two weeks."" ""Our deepest condolences are with the families and friends of those lost to this terrible virus which is afflicting seniors across the country, and we pray for a speedy recovery of those still fighting COVID-19,"" he said. At Royal Rose Place, administrator Helen Millar sent an email to the families of residents there saying she expected all residents of the facility to be tested for the virus by the end of Monday. She said 56 residents have tested positive for the virus and eight have died, while 23 staff members have tested positive for the virus. ""We have received support for procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) and we have sourced out additional staffing,"" Millar wrote in her email. ""We are working closely with public health, Ministry of Health and our community partners (the LHIN and Niagara Health) to support the home."" Royal Rose Place's parent company, Jarlette Health Services, has not responded to requests for comment. At Garden City Manor, Larry Roberts, senior corporate affairs manager for parent company Revera, said the situation has not changed since the outbreak was first declared when one staff member tested positive for the virus. Revera’s chief medical officer Dr. Rhonda Collins said the staff member has not been in the home since April 5, and is in self-isolation.

""She is doing fine, and public health has authorized her to be re-tested to see if she is clear,"" said a representative from the home.

Lavallée said staff at Seasons ask only for support from the community. ""A simple thank you or 'We're thinking of you' can go a long way in making our staff and residents feel appreciated and connected.

These are their stories from the front line of Niagara's battle with the novel coronavirus. Grazia Sheppard doesn't know the personal struggles of every individual who comes to the kitchen window at Westview Centre4Women in St. Catharines. Some are sex trade workers. Some are homeless. Some are having trouble making ends meet. She just knows they're hungry and need help. ""At this time, I don't care who you are. You're at my window, you're in need and I'm giving you what you need,"" said Sheppard, the Queenston Street centre's program director. ""That's what we're doing."" Westview Centre4Women has been serving long lines since it opened its kitchen window after March break for three days a week. Those lines keep growing. The women's drop-in centre had to close to the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it decided to offer lunches and groceries through the window to continue to support its participants who are on very limited incomes. ""It has snowballed,"" said Sheppard. ""We've got women. We've got men. We've got people with families that are coming to the window and saying you know what, I've got three kids at home."" Most are strangers but all are served. Executive director Jane LaVacca said the centre has been handing out 500 sandwiches a week and more than 100 cups of coffee and 100 soups each day. It has given out 300 bags of groceries each week. Two staff, two volunteers and LaVacca's husband, who picks up food donations, are running the operation wearing masks and gloves. The window is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday. LaVacca said some people don't qualify for any financial programs because they're sex trade workers or work under the table and they aren't making money now. ""I know a lot of people will read that in the newspaper and say, that is your fault. You shouldn't be a sex trade worker, you shouldn't be working under the table in Canada, that's not the way we work,"" she said. ""I understand all that, but the reality is they are still people and they need food."" Others showing up are in between social assistance cheques and are finding the money isn't going as far as it used to. With people at home and many out of work, LaVacca said lower cost goods at grocery stores are selling out fast. It used to be easier to find a $1.80 loaf of bread, whereas now it's the $3 to $5 loaves available because everything is picked over. The centre is also getting quite a few single men who are sleeping in nearby Centennial Gardens and others showing up at the window wrapped in blankets. She said it will hand out single serve yogurts and someone will ask for a spoon because there isn't cutlery at home. Some don't have a home.

The centre needs food donations such as granola bars, sandwich fillings, drink boxes, individually wrapped cookies and supplies for takeout, such as cups and bowls with lids and paper bags. Donations can be dropped off at 124 Queenston St. between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday. People can donate money through the website Canada Helps or send an e-transfer to WestviewCF@cogeco.net. Sheppard said she's glad to help people through the pandemic. ""When I see the people I'm giving the bagged lunches to and the groceries to, I'm so thankful to be here to do that,"" she said. ""The COVID doesn't pop into my head, aside from the fact we're handing it out through a window.""

Results from routine health and safety inspections carried out at all private and publicly operated nursing homes are there, in fine detail. Were utensils stored properly in the kitchen? Were food storage racks and pallets kept clean? How about the mechanical dishwasher, was it constructed to meet health department standards? And were violations brought into compliance, or are there still problems? That's good information. It's important to know what goes on inside the places where our parents and grandparents live. So why does public health invoke the cone of near-silence when one of those homes is in COVID-19 outbreak? Look up Lundy Manor in Niagara Falls, for example, and the Region website informs you it has been in COVID-19 outbreak since March 30. That's it. No more. Nothing to indicate the terrible toll the coronavirus has taken on people there, the people it sickened and the efforts staff have made to care for them while risking their own health. It doesn't tell you that all residents and staff at Lundy Manor have been tested for the coronavirus, and that 41 residents and eight staff showed positive results. It doesn't tell you 12 have returned from hospital, while seven remain. Or that 15 residents from Lundy Manor have died from COVID-19. If you had a family member living there, or one who was thinking of moving in, wouldn't you like to be told that? Wouldn't you deserve to be informed? This isn't to single out Lundy Manor, because several other homes across Niagara - Garden City Manor in St. Catharines, Albright Manor in Beamsville, and Seasons Retirement Community and Royal Rose Place both in Welland - are in COVID-19 outbreak as well. As Premier Doug Ford notes, conditions inside most nursing homes mean COVID-19 rips through them like fire on dry grass when it gets inside. On another part of its website, public health reports 33 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in Niagara are residents of long-term care facilities, while 20.3 per cent are health-care workers. Many of those workers are employed by the care facilities. Those facilities are the epicentre of the outbreak in Niagara, as they are in many other places. There were long-standing issues at Ontario's homes before the coronavirus arrived, including low pay for staff who are asked to do more work with less support because government funding isn't adequate. When this is all over, one of the first acts has to involve addressing the way we care for our seniors when they can't live at home.

Sign up for our email newsletters to get the day's top stories, your favourite columnists, and much more in your inbox.Sign Up Now It's necessary for the public to be aware of the impact an outbreak like COVID-19 can have on these places when those problems are finally addressed. Right now, public health isn't releasing the detailed numbers. To read its website, an outbreak at one site is like another. Many of these homes are privately owned and their managers have no incentive to disclose what is happening. To their credit, several in Niagara have been open when contacted by reporters from this paper. But others haven't, and if not for our efforts the detailed numbers might not be known to the public. Our parents and grandparents are basically trapped inside long-term care and nursing homes. Many have gone weeks without being visited by friends or families. Sure, the curve is flattening. But we're worried still. We look to the authorities to get us through this. But when what we get back is little more than silence, it shakes our confidence. - Niagara long-term care homes continue to struggle with outbreaks - Welland long-term care outbreak 'nerve-wracking' to family of senior - Signs of hope found as COVID-19 crisis continues in long-term care homes - The coronavirus is one perfectly built to prey on the elderly.

Niagara public health declared an outbreak in unit 2A of the hospital Tuesday after a patient tested positive for the virus in what is the first Niagara case of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in a patient. Derek McNally, Niagara Health executive vice-president and chief nursing executive, said the case came as a complete surprise to the hospital because the patient did not have a coronavirus infection when admitted. ""This is a patient that had been with us for a while,"" McNally said. ""When they began to exhibit symptoms, they were tested."" When that test came back positive, an outbreak was declared by public health. McNally said the source of the infection is unknown and an investigation to determine how the virus was contracted is ongoing. It is the third COVID-19 outbreak declared in the hospital. Unit 4A — that's where patients with the virus are being treated — and unit 3A, a non-COVID-19 in-patient unit, both have outbreaks. However, Niagara Health said in a news release Tuesday evening that both earlier outbreaks are expected to be declared over soon. - Niagara hospitals expand use of masks after staff tests positive for COVID-19 - Niagara Health mobilizes to help long-term care homes in grip of COVID-19 - Niagara Health fighting the unknowns of COVID-19 one case at a time - COVID-19 Front Line: Managing anxiety and risk at Niagara's pandemic testing centre Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The halls may quiet, but each day brings challenges — and the finance department isn't exempt to the COVID-19 crisis. Expenses are up, and short-term revenues are down. That's not good for the balance sheet. ""I was working in Niagara Falls when the SARS outbreak in 2003 hit, and I was the treasurer during the economic downturn in 2009,"" said Todd Harrison, Niagara Region's commissioner of resource management services and treasurer. ""I am old enough to remember the recessions in the 1980s and 1990s, but there has never been anything like this. Public health is leading the charge, but we need a plan financially as well."" Regional council will get an update Thursday night when Harrison presents a report on what the novel coronavirus is costing the municipality. The preliminary estimate through to June is about $9 million. The report said some expenses can be recouped from the province. More funds are being shaken loose — ""offseting of incremental costs"" if you are an accountant — by redirecting internal spending. The report includes a long list of service impacts and financial implications. • Niagara Regional Transit: fare revenue is down due to reduced ridership and cancellation of Niagara College spring/summer classes. • Provincial Offences Court: Reduced revenue from lower ticket volumes and court closure, with some savings offsets. • Public health: Increased staffing and overtime, supplies (including personal protective equipment) and cleaning costs; additional staff to support higher call volumes. • Paramedic services: Increased staffing, overtime, supplies (including personal protective equipment) and cleaning. • Housing: Increased cleaning costs in common spaces; lower tenant income levels resulting in higher rent subsidies at community housing units and lower rent payments. • Homelessness programs: Increased costs to support homelessness agencies, housing allowances and expenses relating to the rent, staffing, cleaning, personal protective equipment and food for a self-isolation centre. • Children's services: Loss of fee revenue due to closure of childcare centres. • Seniors services: Increased cleaning, staffing, security and personal protective equipment costs. • Technology services: Additional charges relating to increased licences to ensure staff can work remotely. Harrison said the Region has found some savings by not filling some vacant positions and in fuel costs due to the drop in prices. ""All of our partners in the local area municipalities are doing the same thing — curtailing spending, redeploying staff to critical areas, hiring freezes for non-essential staff,"" Harrison said. ""That will help offset a large part of the incremental costs."" The report will offer councillors some recommendations moving forward. Part of the solution is asking for assistance from Queen's Park and Ottawa, who have already made some emergency funding available. Recommendation No. 1 reaffirms the regional chair's ongoing efforts with the province to make sure Niagara taps every cent of available funding.

They are all sharing ideas and best practices. The biggest revenue generators for the Region are property taxes and the rates and fees from the water and sewer systems. They are collected by the local area municipalities and remitted to the Region. Efforts by area municipalities to give struggling property taxpayers a break could have an ripple impact on the Region's finances, Harrison said. Harrison said it is the right thing to do. It's just something else that bears watching. ""If you are a business owner and you are closed down for two months, it is tough to pay any bills, and that includes your property taxes."" The report also says the Taxpayer Relief Reserve is available to offset the increase in expenses. The balance in the account is about $23.8 million. The report said the reserve is underfunded, however. The minimum target for the fund is 10 per cent of gross budgeted operating expenses, which is about $56 million.

Letter carriers from across Niagara Falls converged at the Lundy's Lane retirement home, which has lost 15 residents to COVID-19 in recent weeks, to deliver free coffee and doughnuts. ""Lundy Manor is on my route and, with all the stuff going on, I felt so bad for the people in there and I wanted to do something to put a smile on their faces,"" said letter carrier and event organizer Peter Barnes. On Wednesday afternoon a small convoy of Canada Post trucks and cars pulled up to the retirement home and delivered the refreshments from Tim Hortons on Dorchester Road. ""We stood and waved to everybody and they were waving back at us,"" he said. ""Everything went great."" One letter carrier delivered dozens of fresh flowers to the home. Greg Fortier, executive director at Lundy Manor, said the residents were thrilled by the visit. ""It literally had people in tears, both residents and staff,"" he said. ""It left them with such a positive feeling, seeing the community out there cheering them on."" Barnes purchased the treats after fellow employee Amanda Hancock collected donations from staff at the Queen Street post office. Staff also reached out to family and friends for support. The posties were eager to support the cause and donations came flooding in. Barnes now plans to do similar events at all retirement residences and long-term care facilities in Niagara Falls.

These are their stories from the front line of Niagara's battle with the novel coronavirus. They're not exposed to the coronavirus through their work. A grateful public isn't bringing them food donations or erecting signs of gratitude outside their office door, either. But volunteers at Distress Centre Niagara are on the front line helping people deal with COVID-19, alongside doctors and nurses, paramedics and personal support workers. ""It's such an uncertain time and there is so much isolation involved. Definitely, a lot of people are reaching out,"" said Amanda Stemplowski, who offers text and chat counselling. The numbers prove her right. It's been five weeks since COVID-19 took over people's lives, forcing social isolation, closing schools and putting thousands out of work. Since then, texts and chat calls from people in crisis in Niagara have doubled, to 28 or 30 a day from the usual 14 or 15. The number of people phoning in for crisis counselling, meanwhile, is up by about one-third, to an average of 60 a day from 42. Those are all being answered by a team of volunteer counsellors trained by staff at Distress Centre Niagara to help people through their worst moments. Stemplowski, who will start her master's studies soon for a career in mental health, has volunteered for the past year and a half. Because she handles texts, she deals more with younger people struggling with loneliness, stress or anxiety and who might be considering suicide. ""Any issues, especially right now, come with anxiety,"" she said. ""Whether you're working right now or not, I think both positions are really stressful. And it's such an uncertain time and there is so much isolation involved."" Another volunteer, Bill Snow, works the phones as a counsellor for Distress Centre Niagara. He wasn't sure about it at first — it was his wife's idea to get involved — but said he can't imagine not doing it now. ""It's really the most human thing you can do, just talking to people,"" he said. Helping them get through their worst moments, he said, ""can be emotionally exhausting … but it's a beautiful thing, if you can do that for someone."" He continued: ""People choose to call, right? So when you get somebody that's actively suicidal … the thing you have in the back of your mind is, they did reach out to call. ""People can be very, very desperate and want to end their life. But there's something in them that doesn't want that. That knows there's something else, and longs to make that connection and get through the moment.""

During this week's city council meeting, finance director Tiffany Clark provided councillors with preliminary financial projections, indicating how the health crisis has impacted - and could continue to impact - the municipality up to May 31. She estimated a loss of $800,000 in bank and investment income (full year); $419,000 from reduced transit services; $368,000 from closing arenas and sports fields; $151,000 from waiving property-tax penalties; and $7,000 from closing Niagara Falls History Museum. Clark is also projecting a loss of $5.5 million in casino-hosting revenue, as the two casinos are closed, and $185,000 from parking meters and fines. ""This is an ongoing situation. We don't know when this is going to end."" She said the lost casino revenue will directly impact the 2021 capital budget. ""But if we lose even more than, say $10 million, we're going to be in trouble for what we subsidize in the operating budget, so hopefully that won't happen, but that's something on our radar that we'll have to be monitoring."" The city uses $5.8 million of the more than $20 million it typically receives annually for hosting the two casinos to subsidize taxes. Unlike other levels of government, municipalities are not allowed to run deficits. So, unless an exemption is granted, Niagara Falls will have to find ways to make up any differences between revenues and expenses. Clark said the projected breakdown doesn't include any expected savings the city may incur during the pandemic. A more fulsome breakdown on where the city stands with projected revenues and expenses going forward is expected to be presented during council's May 12 meeting. Coun. Victor Pietrangelo said Niagara Falls is not unique, adding every municipality is ""in the same boat right now."" ""I think for the time being, the best thing that we can do is we can keep track of lost revenues and keep track of any increased expenses and . formulate a game plan when all this goes back to normal."" He said it's expected all municipalities will end up going to the province seeking some help. Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said he has talked to local mayors and concerned councillors and ""it's clear, they're going to need lots of help."" ""We've asked the government to cover 100 per cent of the cost of funding public health. Right now, 30 per cent of that is covered by the municipalities,"" he said. ""We are also asking the province to defer property-tax portions, among other payments they send in to the government. The province can run a deficit in these times, cities can't. These extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, so let's let the towns and cities keep what they can.""

""I'm talking to the premier's office and ministers almost every day. They understand municipalities are cash-strapped, so we're trying to create breathing room now and then fully assess what the damage is when this is over."" Niagara West Progressive Conservative MPP Sam Oosterhoff said he has spoken with several of the region's mayors, as well as Niagara Region Chairman Jim Bradley, about the issue. ""We're going to see a lot of cash-strapped governments at all levels trying to work together to come up with ways that we can mitigate the damage,"" Oosterhoff said. ""I'm not sure what those measures will look like right now. I know there's been a few different tools that people are talking about, but, of course, there's going to have to be those conversations going forward."" Oosterhoff said the provincial government is currently in the first wave of getting the virus under control and providing immediate healthcare and income supports. ""Then there's going to be the rebuilding phase, which is, I think, an enormous piece of this puzzle that we're going to have to work on and make sure we get right later in the year."" - Niagara Falls playgrounds, outdoor fitness equipment, skatepark closed - City of Niagara Falls making operational changes due to COVID-19 - Niagara Falls takes additional steps to curb spread of COVID-19 - Casinos go silent as COVID-19 closes the doors SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

It's been another long day; she's a hospital worker still in uniform, and while she doesn't directly treat patients who have COVID-19, the coronavirus has made everyone's job a little tougher. Who knows who is standing in front of her, or behind her in the lineup outside the store? You can't always tell by the way people are dressed. Maybe a grocery store worker who has encountered a few hundred people at the store during the day. Maybe a family doctor, popping in between patients. Possibly a pharmacy worker who has been dispensing meds all day to sick people. None of them is accused of possibly carrying coronavirus germs, though. Only the hospital worker. All this happened earlier this month, at an LCBO outlet in St. Catharines. The security guard, and then the store manager, wouldn't allow her in because they were afraid she might carry COVID germs into the store. LCBO head office later apologized and offered the woman a $100 gift certificate. We're all nervous about COVID-19 and want to protect ourselves and our families. In many ways the virus remains a mystery, only months old. Even doctors say they are learning something new every day. Sometimes, though, we get scared and lose sight of the common sense that normally gets us through the day. In this case, the woman wasn't wearing scrubs; she was in a uniform. Scrubs worn by medical staff who are caring for patients remain at the hospital. Staff are not permitted to leave hospital property while wearing scrubs. And if we ban hospital workers - most of whom are better protected in their workplace than anyone else - who else are we going to keep out of our public spaces? Older people, because they are said to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus? How about delivery drivers who stop at dozens of homes and businesses every day? Maybe staff from Walmart and Costco - with theatres and arenas closed, those places probably attract more people inside than anywhere else these days. Of course we're not doing that. Our fears are understandable, but let's not lose our sense of logic. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune. Sign up for our email newsletters to get the day's top stories, your favourite columnists, and much more in your inbox.Sign Up Now As public health officials have told us, the best protection is still simple: Cover your coughs and sneezes; Wash your hands thoroughly and often; Stay home as much as possible; And when you do go out, maintain a good six feet between you and everyone else. Most stores are on board with this. They limit the number of people allowed inside, laying down directional arrows and floor markers to keep them separated in lineups, and making hand sanitizer available to customers. It's the people who defy these guidelines, by going to work when they are sick, congregating in crowds or getting into other people's space, that are the true risk. But there are measures for that, too: Every municipal website has contact information for people to lodge complaints when they see people breaking those rules. The same common sense applies to public spaces. Remember, it is still fine to go out for exercise, especially when people have been largely house-bound for the past month. It's OK to go for a walk or a run. Again, think it through - go out, but not in groups. Keep a safe distance between yourself and people you don't share your home with. These really are crazy times we are living through, but let's not get too crazy. Common sense, and following the simple safety steps public health workers continually emphasize, will get us through this eventually.

Organized by Rocco Cotugno, supervisor at the Port Colborne office, 33 vehicles caravaned past Niagara Health sites in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland. Another 20 employees participated in the event on the sidelines by shooting videos and photos of the parade. The gesture was inspired by a similar event in Toronto, but also a local postie whose aunt was a retired health-care worker in the U.S. who came back to work during the crisis, became infected with COVID-19 and died, he said. The parade also made its way down Lundy's Lane in Niagara Falls and past Lundy Manor, a long-term residence under an outbreak. Cotugno said the largest crowd formed in Welland, which included residents who live near the hospital. Staff who came outside were visibly moved by the tribute, he said. ""There were staff who were teary-eyed, clapping and saying thank you,"" he said. Participation included postal workers from St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Welland, Port Colborne and Fort Erie. After hearing about a parade in Toronto, Cotugno immediately inquired with Canada Post's head office in Ottawa about putting one together in Niagara. He said he was given the green light right away. The number of people who volunteered their weekend evening to take part was moving, he said, adding it was a great opportunity to honour the people on the front line of the COVID-19 crisis. ""It touched me. These people here are working countless hours under a lot of duress and not seeing their families,"" he said. Cotugno said more events like Saturday's parade may end up being organized in other parts of the region in the near future. - Canada Post delivers smiles to Lundy Manor - Canada Post sees 'Christmas-level' volumes Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The city is challenging residents and businesses to do something to celebrate from the safety of their homes and share what they did with others on social media. Suggested ideas are baking a cake or other goods with a city theme, putting up decorations, creating artwork, writing a poem or story, making sidewalk chalk or window art, saying thank you to essential workers who support the community, supporting local businesses, clubs and volunteers, or anything else. Everyone is asked to share their celebrations with the rest of the community by using the hashtag #OurHomeSTC or tagging the city's social media accounts in their posts. A list of city accounts can be found at stcatharines.ca/socialmedia. ""Although birthday parties are different these days, we still have a lot to celebrate as a community,"" Mayor Walter Sendzik said in a news release. ""The people of St. Catharines have worked really hard to do their part to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this a great opportunity to celebrate our community spirit safely from your own home."" St. Catharines was incorporated as a city on May 1, 1876. In honour of the city's birthday, St. Catharines DJ Blake Belcher will be holding a livestreamed event at 7 p.m. at www.twitch.tv/byrequestdjs. The event will include an address by Sendzik, historical footage, musical tributes to Polka King Walter Ostanek, Rush's Neil Peart, City and Colour, current local bands and more. All funds raised during the event which runs until 10 p.m. will be matched by Doug Smith Financial and go to Community Care of St. Catharines and Thorold.

In an email, Ontario Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development spokesperson Janet Deline said a ministry inspector was at the Regional Road 20 store last Friday. She said enhanced screening and cleaning procedures were reviewed at the store - which was being operated by Ron Kore, who is also a Town of Pelham councillor - and no orders were issued. Last week, Deline said the ministry investigation was prompted by news articles and inquiries from the media over the store and Kore. Kore has been temporarily removed as the store's operator while Sobeys' head office conducts an internal investigation following complaints from customers and employees about possible COVID-19 contamination. This past Sunday, Kore broke his silence on the matter and confirmed he had tested positive for the virus. That came after Pelham Mayor Marvin Junkin accused Kore of coming to a council meeting March 23 showing symptoms of COVID-19, and said he may have infected another councillor. Junkin called Kore a ""high-risk individual"" in an email obtained by the Niagara Dailies. The other councillor he referred to is Mike Ciolfi, who died April 13. The Niagara Dailies have not confirmed the Ward 1 councillor had COVID-19, as has been reported elsewhere. Kore said he was told on April 13 that he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and he made a request to be tested. His doctor was able to get him a test and Kore said the only time he left home was on April 17 for that test. He received confirmation April 20 he had tested positive for COVID-19. That same day, he was told by public health he was ""no longer infectious,"" he said. The nurse who contacted him said this meant he could ""resume normal activities of work"" and did ""not need to self-isolate,"" he said in a release Sunday. He said he has remained in a 14-day self-quarantine since learning of the positive result. As a 63-year-old individual with a history of heart disease, the Sobeys franchisee said he "" would never take a risk with my health, the health of my wife, employees or colleagues at town hall."" Niagara Regional Police conducted an investigation, but said based on a preliminary review it was determined a criminal inquiry was not an appropriate course of action. Attempts to reach Kore and Sobeys for comment on the Ministry of Labour investigation were unsuccessful Thursday.

He said there are many factors that will have to be considered before elective surgeries, which Niagara Health made the ""difficult decision"" to postpone in mid-March, will resume. ""For safety reasons, all hospitals, including Niagara Health, were told to postpone surgical procedures because of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said McNally. ""We did continue to perform emergency and urgent surgeries. We have an executive committee of our surgical program that meets on a weekly basis to determine the cases that are on the list for urgent and emergent, and also new cases that have come on the list to look at the priorities for those cases. ""Each case is reviewed, and cases are re-prioritized if new care plans are required to be developed, and if patients' conditions change."" ""We'll need to re-introduce services because there is a large number of patients whose surgeries have been postponed, and so we'll have to really take a good look at what does that look like as we start to ramp up,"" he said. ""We've actually started some preliminary planning, and we're expecting more provincial guidance on this."" McNally said before certain procedures resume, Niagara Health officials will have to consider many factors, including whether it has a ""low disease burden of COVID-19,"" whether it has a stable rate of COVID-19 cases within its organization, whether it has a stable supply of personal protective equipment, and whether it has a stable supply of medications for allocation for additional surgeries. He said officials will also have to look at the capacity of its intensive-care units ""because some of our major surgeries, the patients would be required to go to intensive care after their surgery."" McNally said the Niagara Health Foundation has been successful in securing many ""generous"" donations from local businesses and organizations during the pandemic, which have helped them obtain necessary personal protective equipment such as masks and gowns. He said Niagara Health is ""OK right now"" when it comes to its supply. ""Every day, we have a virtual emergency operations centre meeting where we discuss a number of key things - one of them is the amount of PPE available on that day and going forward, and then planning for future needs. ""We have a fantastic logistics team who's consistently, every day, on top of that and making sure that we have the right supplies to keep our patients and staff and physicians safe."" Visits to Niagara's three emergency departments and two urgent-care centres are down between 40 to 50 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I think across the entire province, the numbers have gone down and specifically for Niagara Health . we've seen a significant decrease in the volumes - we've decreased anything from 40 to 50 per cent, dependent on the day,"" said McNally. He said he's not exactly sure why volumes are down at emergency rooms in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland, and urgent-care centres in Port Colborne and Fort Erie.

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact.

The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring.

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines.""

One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished.

Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her.

You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective.

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact.

The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Get more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines.""

One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home.

Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished.

Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission.

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact.

The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results.

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The Yerich family, which owns the Holiday Inn in Niagara Falls, recently donated toilet paper and other essentials from its hotel to the agency to distribute to clients.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday.

""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal.

She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now.

""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said.

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading...

""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said.

""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army .

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this.

Niagara Region Meals on Wheels modifies deliveries due to COVID-19 By Alison LangleyReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Sun., March 22, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Food requests have spiked at Meals on Wheels in Niagara Falls in recent weeks as people practise social distancing in the wake of COVID-19. ""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Niagara Region Meals on Wheels modifies deliveries due to COVID-19 By Alison LangleyReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Sun., March 22, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Food requests have spiked at Meals on Wheels in Niagara Falls in recent weeks as people practise social distancing in the wake of COVID-19. ""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious.""

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Niagara Region Demand for Niagara food banks growing By The Welland Tribune Thu., March 19, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 In short order, the demand for food bank services across Niagara is starting to rise. Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading...

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said. Loading...

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Pharmacist Sean Simpson said he hopes other businesses follow the lead of his Simpson's Pharmacy locations. ""I hope that people start taking this concept of social distancing seriously,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can, but I'm a bit discouraged by what I'm seeing right now. Maybe we're expecting more direction from government, but I just think we need to do more."" The pharmacy has begun asking its senior customers to visit the store from 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the business will remain open to all customers for the remainder of the day. Simpson is also encouraging its customers to take advantage of its free delivery service, particularly those who maybe experiencing or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms, including a fever, cough and trouble breathing. ""We are prepared to ramp up our delivery capacity to whatever it needs to be, but we encourage people to stay home,"" the pharmacist said. If business can make it easier for people to stay home, ""I think that all of Niagara will benefit,"" he said. ""I'm hoping Niagara will be the place that gets social distancing right, but we all need to step up and get pretty aggressive on the things that need to be done to protect the people around us."" Other businesses have taken steps to encourage social distancing, as well. Showtime Comedy owner Marc Sinodinos said he has removed tables and chairs in his St. Catharines venue, reducing its capacity to 80 seats — down from 140. ""Most of our shows, the audiences are filled with soccer teams, different clubs, organizations and charities all doing fundraisers here,"" he wrote in an email. ""We rely solely on large groups which makes us unique during the times where nobody wants to be around large groups."" Some restaurants and cafes have also opted to provide takeout service only, closing their seating to customers, while several offices have closed doors to the public. Meanwhile, Simpson said his pharmacies have been hard hit by the rush for such items as toiletries amid fears people will be isolated in their homes. ""We're hoping that our orders will be replenished, but we are low on a lot of supplies that people are coming in for,"" he said. ""We're hoping the supply chain continues and picks up so people can get all of the things that they need, but because of that we also put limits on how many of one item people can buy. We don't want to see that panic."" Despite the shortage of supplies, Simpson said it has not affected the availability of medications yet — although there are a few drugs that were in short supply prior to the pandemic. He suspects that may change, ""but we're hoping that if everyone maintains a sense of calm that we will be able to navigate through this."" ""It's of utmost importance that people educate themselves in the steps they can take to minimize their own risk and the risk of spreading the virus to others, particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society, which is the elderly,"" Simpson said.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times Loading...

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. Loading... Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading... Loading... ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on. ""I definitely want to continue this as long as it's needed.""

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said.

Niagara's 12 mayors and the regional chair announced the formation of the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team last week. The team will support businesses of all sizes across the municipalities by providing information and resources to help them keep going. ""What is it businesses are facing? There's a tremendous amount of fear, fear of the unknown and not knowing where to start,"" said St. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik. He said he knows what they're going through. His own business nearly went bankrupt in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and he didn't think it would make it. He said entrepreneurs in the middle of that situation often don't know what's happening or where to start to help themselves. ""The economic development teams can be that calming voice,"" he said, explaining they can give businesses a list of things they should think about immediately. ""They know business, they can talk to business people, they know their language and they can start to build together how they should be planning for this."" Sendzik said the goal is to bring all the economic development offices together to help businesses beyond each municipal boundary. If a business in Thorold needs help, for instance, it can call St. Catharines and no one is going to be turned away. The team will be able to respond to immediate questions businesses have across the spectrum. ""Whether you're a florist, whether you're in agricultural, hospitality, a convenience store, whatever it may be, you'll be able to reach out — 'I'm at a loss, what should I do?' — and the voice on the other side will be the voice of calm and reason and be able to say, 'Here's what you can do immediately.'"" Business owners can contact their local economic development office or email info@niagaracanada.com, where messages will be triaged and they'll be connected with a member of the team. ""This is going to be a critical part of supporting the business community,"" Sendzik said. St. Catharines director of economic development and government relations Brian York said the team has spoken with federal and provincial counterparts and are awaiting details on how financial aid announced this week can be accessed by businesses in Niagara. He said the team will also be surveying and compiling data on the losses and impact COVID-19 has on local business. It will document and share that information with other levels of government so that evidence-based aid flows to Niagara businesses. ""The majority of Niagara businesses are owner-operated, so it's very concerning,"" York said. ""An $82-billion (federal aid) package is a great announcement. How quickly can we make that flow to the business owner-operator and the families that are affected?"" Mishka Balsom, president and chief executive officer of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commence, said employers are looking for information and want to provide employees with information, too. The chamber has been updating information on its website and social media sites daily and will work with the rapid response team. ""Everything is changing from hour to hour, one minute to the next. I think there's a real need for business information,"" she said. ""We're very good when it comes to the health end of it, of keeping us updated on that, and I think equally it's starting when it comes to business information as well, and that is needed at this point.""

Business Niagara businesses awaiting closure details from Ford By Allan BennerStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Mon., March 23, 2020timer4 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Closing the doors of non-essential businesses is difficult, but the alternative may be worse. ""The quicker we do this, the quicker we will actually be back to stability for our society and our economy,"" said Greater Niagara Chamber of commerce executive director Mishka Balsom. ""I think that is the overriding sense that we hear from businesses. That's the first part of it."" Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that all non-essential businesses would be ordered to close their doors to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. The order comes into effect Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. and will remain in place for at least two weeks. Despite the challenges, Balsom said keeping Niagara businesses running would only prolong the uncertainty they face. ""We will not recover. The interruptions will be longer than it possibly needs to be,"" she said. ""Businesses are fully understanding that we really need to look at all the options that we have available to us right now and moving forward."" Balsom, however, said governments also must work together to ensure supports are in place to help businesses cope with the shutdown. While programs that have been announced so far are encouraging, she said they fall short of meeting needs. ""Overall, it is by far not enough to reduce some of the economic impact that especially small business owners are facing. That is a huge challenge to them,"" she said. ""We need to see more to support businesses."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for Niagara Falls, Welland-Pelham and Port Colborne-Wainfleet chambers of commerce, called closure a ""tough, tough decision, but these are kind of scary times and I think at the end of the day we have to err on the side of caution — everybody's safety is the most important thing."" However, she said, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding Monday's announcement — including the types of businesses that could remain open. Fabiano said she wished the provincial government had all the answers before making the announcement. ""I wonder if they're trying to figure it out as we go, too, because this is just changing so quick — every hour on the hour."" In the aftermath of the announcement, some Niagara business owners anxiously waited to learn if they'd be able to stay open. Many of Niagara's wineries had already all but closed their doors. Harold Thiel from Hidden Bench Estate Winery said his business has shut down to all but online orders. ""Our doors have been closed from a safety point of view for our own staff as well as for our clients since last week,"" he said. ""I think we need to play this by ear and see what direction the government goes on this one."" Sue-Ann Staff said she understands and supports the government action, adding the safety of customers and staff always comes first. However, the owner of Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery said the industry has already been hard hit by the loss of the tourism industry, followed by the closure of restaurants — two industries on which it depends. ""Luckily, sales in the LCBO are very good and we need to continue our sales to ensure we keep the greenbelt green."" Fabiano said many businesses have staff working from home or ""trying to get to that point."" ""I know that we've got some great members who are offering some free assistance in getting people set up,"" she said. ""But there are a lot of businesses that that doesn't work for them."" The Niagara Economic Development office is guaging the impact the pandemic is having on local businesses. The organization's manager of economic research and analysis, Blake Landry, said Niagara Region's Economic Rapid Response Team has reached out to more than 8,000 business since last Friday, and asked them to complete the Niagara COVID-19 Business Impact Survey to help assess the virus's impact. ""We're getting a huge response from that,"" he said. The survey will be available until noon March 31 to ensure various business sectors are reflected in the information. ""We'll be going back out again on probably Wednesday or Thursday to get some additional followup. Probably early next week, we'll start looking at what the information shows us,"" he said. ""We'll apply that to advocacy and try to get new programing to try to help with the recovery effort."" Landry said Monday's announcement was not unexpected. ""You could see early last week that something was brewing."" Niagara Falls NDP MPP Wayne Gates said since Ford's announcement, ""everybody is trying to figure out"" what is and isn't an essential business. ""I think if you're going to put something like this out, you should come with the details,"" he said. ""There's no clarity. We're trying to get the same (clarity) as everybody else. We can all guess, right."" Gates said he was on the phone ""all day"" dealing with constituents unsure of what the future may bring. ""I have received some calls from some people here around closing real-estate deals and all those types of things and they don't know what's going on."" — with files from Ray Spiteri Allan.Benner@niagaradailies.com 905-225-1629 | @abenner1 - Rapid response team to help Niagara businesses through COVID-19 - Serving takeout and delivery 'isn't worth the risk': Welland restaurateur - St. Catharines downtown shops find unique ways to serve customers - Metro and Loblaw offer $2/hour raise to workers during COVID-19 pandemic SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More Business Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on. ""I definitely want to continue this as long as it's needed.""

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times - Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight - From grocery pickups to dog walking: good Samaritans step up to help those impacted by COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Niagara Region Meals on Wheels modifies deliveries due to COVID-19 By Alison LangleyReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Sun., March 22, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Food requests have spiked at Meals on Wheels in Niagara Falls in recent weeks as people practise social distancing in the wake of COVID-19. ""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. The Yerich family, which owns the Holiday Inn in Niagara Falls, recently donated toilet paper and other essentials from its hotel to the agency to distribute to clients.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Niagara Region COVID-19 funding should relieve some anxiety, Niagara MPs say By Karena WalterStandard Reporter The St. Catharines Standard Wed., March 18, 2020timer3 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle says Canada's $82-billion COVID-19 response plan is a message to Canadians - focus on your health first because the government has your back. ""No one is going to be left behind,"" Bittle said, following economic measures announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday. ""The goal is to make sure no one has to choose between staying home and taking care of a loved one versus going to work. We are going to continue to work to ensure all Canadians are taken care of."" The plan includes various measures to provide assistance for people who have to stay home because they are sick, quarantined or told to self-isolate, those caring for a sick family member or caring for kids out of school, as well as for workers facing unemployment because of the pandemic and businesses facing losses. There's also a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments and flexibility for lenders to defer mortgage payments. In all, it includes $27 billion to directly support workers and businesses and $55 billion in supports for people and businesses through tax deferrals. ""We are facing a lot of unknowns going forward, but I think the message from today's announcement is we've got Canadians' backs,"" Bittle said. ""And we're going to ensure that they're able to focus on their health. The public health of Canadians is the No. 1 concern."" The big question for workers and businesses is how and when they can access the money. Niagara Centre Liberal MP Vance Badawey said Wednesday's announcement was about what will be put in people's pockets. In the coming days there will be details about implementation and how people can access funds. He said the government is working to get money out as quickly as possible and is hoping it can happen in the next two or three weeks. ""People are getting very worried. They're being sent home without pay, some without any means to basically keep food in the fridge and on the table and bills paid. These are the measures we're taking to actually alleviate a lot of those concerns,"" Badawey said, adding there's a lot of anxiety in the community. Badawey and Bittle said they were fielding many calls at their offices from concerned residents. ""The bottom line is we want to take the vulnerability away from people, we want to take the anxiety and pressure off their shoulders,"" Badawey said. ""The biggest thing is to ensure people don't have to worry about paying their bills, or their rent or food on their table."" Niagara Falls Conservative MP Tony Baldinelli has also been receiving concerned calls and said the Tories support the measures to put more money into Canadians' pockets. ""It's vitally important that we assist those Canadians who are greatly impacted by COVID-19. Our job is to work with the government to ensure that those who are struggling will find out - they need to know - when they can expect to start receiving that support."" Baldinelli said MPs are ready to return to Ottawa when asked, to pass emergency legislation so they can support people affected by COVID-19. Mishka Balsom, president and CEO of Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce, said the announcement Wednesday was a step in a ""much needed direction"" to support employers and employees. ""Businesses are truly feeling the strain and especially small ones across Niagara,"" she said. She said steps such as allowing businesses to defer paying income tax until after Aug. 31, additional credits and temporary wage subsidies are welcomed. ""All of those are really key ones to support the employer and the employees, but also in the long term the economy and ensuring we'll move to a stronger economy again,"" she said.

Although the shelves at such places as The Hope Centre and Open Arms Mission in Welland, Port Cares in Port Colborne, Pelham Cares and Community Care St. Catharines and Thorold aren't empty they are starting to thin out. And things are likely to get much more dire as people are laid off and paycheques dry up as the state of emergency in Ontario continues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We've seen a significant increase,"" said Hope Centre chief executive officer Jon Braithwaite, adding the agency has modified access to its King Street site in keeping with social distancing. Feeding 50 families a day, Braithwaite said, the agency is seeing people who haven't accessed the food bank for six months to a year. There's also an expected increase in the number of first-time users of food banks, he said. ""As things remain closed, I expect to see usage to increase,"" he said, adding there's concern over food supplies. Items that include canned tuna, salmon, vegetables and fruit are in short supply now. Marty Misener, executive director of Open Arms Mission, said his agency, too, expects an increase in first-time users in days and weeks ahead. ""The need is only going to grow."" He said people are calling in to see if the mission is open as so many things are shut down right now. Food was quickly going out the window at the Fifth Street mission, especially with children already home for March break. ""That doubles the impact … children are eating more food while at home. People don't have enough food on the table, especially with the grocery store situation … they are unable to acquire the food they need."" Port Cares executive director Christine Clark Lafleur said her agency has seen a slight increase in visits. It will have a better idea next week as to how many more people are using its services. Its food bank at the Reach Out Centre on Nickel Street assists 1,400 people a year, with a third of those being children. On average 9,100 kilograms of food is distributed each month. The agency also runs a lunch kit program aimed at elementary and secondary school children who live in low-income households. Last year, it provided 2,020 kits — more than 12,000 lunches to children in the city. ""We're already having difficulty in finding supplies for the program. School kids still need food,"" she said, adding the program normally continues through March break. Jennifer Dubé, Pelham Cares' client services co-ordinator, said her agency hasn't seen an increase in food bank use and regular orders were expected to go out Friday. ""We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks,"" she said, noting 60 boxes of food go out every Friday. Pelham Cares' shelves are still stocked, but the coming weeks will tell whether supplies need to be replenished. ""We might have to cut back what we give to families if we get low."" Community Care chief executive officer Betty-Lou Souter said her agency has been busier than normal. ""We've seen a 10 to 15 per cent increase in people. People are very concerned … the anxiety level is huge, and they are afraid they won't be able to get what they need."" She said Community Care assesses its inventory regularly and received a significant donation from a local restaurant but doesn't know what things will be like a few weeks from now. To help out Open Arms, Handlebar Hanks Roadhouse owner Rick Christoff, whose business is now temporarily closed, worked with cook Simon Appleton to fry up 1,500 chicken wings and make 10 pizzas. ""When we forced to close, we had a full inventory and were kind of at a loss of what to do,"" said Christoff. He said Mayor Frank Campion suggested donating to the mission. ""We decided to donate all our non-perishable food versus throwing it out,"" Christoff said. ""Why waste food, and it's a good cause."" - More action urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind in COVID-19 crisis - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The union said it was notified Thursday afternoon that the entire plant of 1,150 workers will suspend production at the end of the afternoon shift at 11 p.m. Friday. ""This will make a lot of people happy,"" said Unifor Local 199 GM unit chairman Tim McKinnon. The company announced Wednesday it was systematically shutting down plants across North America during the pandemic but most Glendale Avenue workers were not given a closure date. A notice posted Wednesday by the plant director said the GF6 transmissions operation would be temporarily laid off starting Monday due to customer demand in line with CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll. But the HFV6 and Gen V lines would ""continue to operate as normal."" The union predicted there were enough parts to keep the plant operating for another week. ""They've changed their minds and decided it's better to get everybody out and bite the bullet,"" McKinnon said Thursday. McKinnon said it was a good business decision — the company will have parts when the plant starts up again — and will help protect workers. The announced closure comes at a time of rising anxiety in the plant as other businesses shut down because of the pandemic and public health officials call for social distancing. ""It's going to be a hotbed when the virus gets in there and we'll pass it on to our families,"" said one GM worker before the closure announcement. ""It's scary."" The St. Catharines Standard granted anonymity to several workers because they feared their jobs could be at risk for sharing their concerns publicly. GM said earlier in the week that additional health and safety procedures are in place at the plant, including production breaks for extra cleaning, but workers who spoke with The Standard Thursday said they didn't see evidence of it, and if measures were happening, they weren't going far enough. One person who works inside the plant said people were being giving a false sense of security. ""For a company that says it has a system in place, no one seems to know what that system is."" Another worker said some people work very closely beside each other. He couldn't understand why restaurants and bars were shut down by the province, along with other gathering places, while GM workers continued to go into work. ""It's just not a necessity like a hospital worker or something like that,"" he said. ""It just feels like they're playing with fire."" That was echoed by another employee who works in another area than him. ""I don't know why the world is shutting down and we have to build engines."" The workers weren't the only ones who were worried — their families were, too. One woman who contacted the paper said it was ""irresponsible"" to expect employees like her husband to continue until parts ran out. ""Our family has been work from home all week to stay safe and my husband has to go to work with hundreds of others putting us at risk."" GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said on Thursday the company is in constant discussion with its union and employees in its plants on all aspects of their work together ""to maintain a safe workplace in this challenging time."" It's not known when the plant will re-open once it's shut down but a company release on Wednesday said suspensions will last until last least March 30. McKinnon said union members will go on employment insurance, with some eligible for top-ups through the union contract.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.

Niagara Region COVID-19 and transit in Niagara: Niagara Falls, St. Catharines reduce services, Welland unchanged By Ray SpiteriReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Thu., March 19, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Thursday saw more transit service reductions across Niagara. According to the City of Niagara Falls, the move ""must be undertaken due to an impending lack of manpower and in the best interest of operations and public safety"" as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The municipality has removed all peak service (30-minute service) on regular routes Nos. 101 to 114. Effective Sunday, the city will reduce weekday service to a Sunday schedule, operating hourly 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wego will provide winter-level service, operating the red line from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the blue line 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Chair-A-Van will provide essential trips only (medical, employment, education and essential shopping) to currently registered users only. Chair-A-Van will not accept new applications at this time. All fleets will undergo enhanced cleaning measures. COVID-19 has led Niagara Falls to create rotating shifts for full-time staff and lay off some seasonal and temporary employees. St. Catharines Transit also reduced its bus service through the city. Transit is on a modified schedule similar to its usual Saturday service which will remain in place at least until April 3. The change still provides broad coverage of its service area with no reduction in the length of the service day. The following St. Catharines routes will operate Monday to Friday, with no change to evening, weekend or Sunday service: •401 Hospital-Port Dalhousie; 402 Ontario Street; 404 Oakdale-Pen Centre; 406 Lake Street; 408 Grantham-Port Weller; 409 Geneva Street; 410 Glenridge-Pen Centre. •412 Vine Street; 414 Scott Street; 415 West St. Catharines; 416 Brock-Glenridge; 417 Bunting-Lakeshore; 418 Secord Woods; 420 Thorold-Pen Centre; 421 Confederation-Brock; 337 Crosstown; 322 Thorold-South. The City of Welland has not announced any schedule changes to its transit service. The East Main Street transit terminal remains open to the public. Welland Transit manager Dave Stuart said the situation is ""ever evolving"" and should revisions be required, the city will provide updates to the community. He said effective Monday, the Monday to Saturday Niagara Region Transit services, operated by the municipal service providers (Welland, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls) will operate on the Saturday schedule.

Niagara Region Meals on Wheels modifies deliveries due to COVID-19 By Alison LangleyReview Reporter The Niagara Falls Review Sun., March 22, 2020timer2 min. read updateArticle was updated Jun. 02, 2020 Food requests have spiked at Meals on Wheels in Niagara Falls in recent weeks as people practise social distancing in the wake of COVID-19. ""There's been an increase in our frozen meals this week, almost double what we had been doing on a weekly basis,"" said executive director Marianne McRae. She said the non-profit volunteer service, which provides home delivery of hot or frozen meals, is so far able to accommodate the increase in demand. At issue these days, however, is how the food can be delivered without putting the health of both clients and volunteers at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are conducting business as close to usual as possible,"" McRae said. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, volunteers would pick up food at the Meals on Wheels' office at Greater Niagara General Hospital. The hospital is now closed to visitors, so agency staff are handing out meals to volunteers in a nearby parking lot. In the past, volunteers would often stay and chat with clients. That isn't possible due to new social-distancing guidelines. Volunteers, equipped with disposable gloves and hand sanitizer, no longer enter a client's home. ""We basically knock on the door and leave the meal for them,"" McRae explained. ""The volunteers make sure the client opens the door to receive the meal - we want to make sure they are OK - then we step away, and that keeps both parties safe."" Also, crews have replaced insulated carrying bags, which would require disinfecting after each delivery, with single use plastic bags. ""For the moment, that is what we've come up with, which is the safest for everybody,"" McRae said. The local program, which serves Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake, is open to anyone who is at ""nutritional risk."" That may include the elderly, people with physical challenges and those recently discharged from hospital. Each year, an army of nearly 200 volunteers delivers 35,000 meals to 800-plus clients. ""We will not stop,"" McRae said of the current situation. ""We are considered an essential service and our whole purpose is to keep people safe in their own homes and not in hospitals."" She said new volunteers are always welcome, as some of the volunteer drivers have had to take a step back at this time. The Yerich family, which owns the Holiday Inn in Niagara Falls, recently donated toilet paper and other essentials from its hotel to the agency to distribute to clients.

But what will be the new normal? That was among the questions put to three prominent Niagara businesspeople earlier this week, in an online forum held by the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. ""Touchless scenarios are going to be the order of the day,"" said Alex Digenis, owner and general manager of Subaru of Niagara, Henley Honda and Skyway Fine Cars. ""We have an app that you not only book appointments (through), but you pay through the app. The whole delivery model will be a little different. ""Our sales department is already working on amazing YouTube videos that basically show our product . so if a customer is not able to test drive a product, they are going to be sent a host of different delectables to consume on YouTube."" The plan, he said, is to move forward ""in a manner that is hyper-sensitive to our current situation."" Mike Watt, executive vice president of Walker Industries, said one change he expects is there will be ""a lot less travel"" for work. ""I've been spending about an hour a day, just picking up the phone or talking on Zoom and talking to random employees across Canada. ""I can tell you I'm not going to be flying to Vancouver as much. I've talked to the guy that runs the Vancouver shop more in the last five weeks than I've talked to him in the last six months. ""We've found ways to communicate more easily, we don't have to get in airplanes anymore."" He said it's one of the fundamental changes that have been made necessary because of social distancing and restrictions on travel governments are enforcing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""I hope people don't go back to their old habits,"" Watt said. ""And it's unfortunate for the airline business, but we always thought we needed to be in somebody's office to make an impact. ""Sometimes that's the case, but in a lot of cases I think you're just going to be doing a Zoom call or whatever and making it work."" Sue-Ann Staff, owner and winemaker at Sue-Ann Staff Estate Winery, speculated tourism - with its reliance on large numbers of people coming together often in confined spaces - might take longer to recover than other industries. ""People are going to need the money to spend those disposable dollars . and then need the comfort level of where they are going,"" she said. People are still wary of being close to others, something she said she sees even when delivering wine to people who ordered it from her. ""When I go to a home to make a delivery, the fear in people's eyes - 'why are you here? You're coming into my safe zone,'"" she said. It ""kind of foreshadows what the feeling is out there."" Digenis stressed he wasn't minimizing or making light of people's fears of contracting the coronavirus. ""Nobody on this panel is sugarcoating it . it's terrible,"" he said. ""But man, if this is the test of our time, I can sleep at night knowing that my 22-year-old son is not fighting a war in another part of the world. We're not getting shot at by a foreign army . ""There have been tests in our generation, in our lifetime, in our parents' lifetime, that have really put things in perspective. I'm not minimizing financial hardship and the mental anguish that comes with that."" Gord.Howard@niagaradailies.com - 'It's so not over.'

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

""I went to the grocery store the day they announced the pandemic and I saw what people were like,"" recalled the 26-year-old Niagara Falls resident. His thoughts immediately went to his 73-year-old grandfather. ""He doesn't have the option or ability to go to a grocery store and fight over toilet paper. I wouldn't want my grandparent in that environment, I don't think anybody would."" Stockton and his friend Mario Bozza, also of Niagara Falls, purchased some toilet paper and other items such as wipes, water and Kleenex and posted an ad on Facebook and Kijiji, offering to deliver their free personal care kits to the elderly and vulnerable populations. ""It started with a single message, then I got hundreds and then I got over 1,000,"" said Stockton. While most were messages supporting their initiative, as well as people wanting to donate items to the cause, there were also messages from people in the community who needed help. In the past five days, the duo, both merchant mariners, have made 83 deliveries and pickups across Niagara. Stockton and Bozza, 37, have received donations from Avondale, Niagara Regional Police, Lifehouse Church in Fort Erie and Latcham PML Foods, as well as from countless individuals. ""Although the messages of support are amazing to see, from all over Canada, I don't think anything we're doing now makes us good people,"" Stockton said. ""We're not special or unique. This is what we should be doing as humans when vulnerable people need help. It shouldn't be considered special to show basic compassion, especially in times like these."" That's the same selfless message embraced by a group of students at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Five students recently came together to launch a COVID-19 support initiative and have recruited student volunteers within the healthcare field to donate time and talent to front-line health-care workers in Niagara, Hamilton and Waterloo. The group has attracted some 140 volunteers. Organizers are working to match students with people needing assistance. The student-led effort, which is not affiliated with McMaster, will support health-care workers through babysitting, grocery runs, pet care and general errands. ""We just want to lighten their burden during this unprecedented time,"" said co-organizer and St. Catharines native Mackenzie Stoness. Fellow student Marina Liu agreed. ""We know people working the front lines so we wanted to try to ease the burden on them as much as we can,"" she said. Additional students are needed, particularly volunteers able to offer child care. - Toilet paper left at doorsteps: Wellanders show neighbourly love in fearful times - Trudeau promises $82B in economic supports in COVID-19 fight - From grocery pickups to dog walking: good Samaritans step up to help those impacted by COVID-19 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

""We've emailed them and told them, tell us what you need right now,"" said executive director Frances Hallworth. ""As they need those things, we will be sending the money out. ""We can get money out very quickly to our organizations, they won't have to wait."" Donations can be made online at https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/covid-19-emergency-response-fund/. Donations can also be made on the phone by calling 905-688-5050. Although all United Way Niagara offices are closed and employees are working off-site, calls are being answered remotely. Across the region, the United Way funds 111 programs through 54 partner agencies, reaching nearly 120,000 people. ""We have been in contact with all of our agencies,"" said Hallworth. ""Some of them are on the frontlines and are overwhelmed, and others have had to cease service because of what they do."" Many of those groups work with small staffs and rely heavily on volunteers and are also scrambling to keep pace with the changes brought on by the outbreak. For some agencies, the United Way provides funding for more than one program. Hallworth said her staff are working with ones that want to shift money toward more pressing needs — possibly emergency shelter or food bank services, or ones that visit seniors in their homes — and away from less-urgent ones. ""Communicate with us and we will get back to you very quickly, and you can move those funds to more essential services,"" she said. ""In fairness to all our agencies that are still working, this is an evolving plan for them. No one could ever have prepared for what is happening. ""Things are evolving by the hour."" The Unitde Way hasn't set a goal for the emergency fund — ""as much as possible, so we can meet the needs of the organizations as they come to us."" She noted steps different levels of government have taken, such as extending tax deadlines and loosening restrictions on qualifying for Employment Insurance. But some of the people who will most need that help, such as tourism workers or others in the service industry, might already be hurting as businesses reduce employees' hours or lay off staff. ""While some very good things are happening … those funds are not going to reach people quickly. I believe the estimate right now is three weeks. ""There are many people who are living below the poverty line who were not able to stock up on food, as they didn't have the resources to do it. And now their pay cheque has stopped."" Hallworth said the United Way started preparing about a month ago for the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring staff had the capability to work from home. Around the same time, she said, they began hearing informally from local organizations that were also worried. Not everyone took it seriously at the start, ""but I find that flipped very quickly. We were taking it incredibly serious."" She said it's important that people know every dollar donated to the emergency fund will stay in Niagara to provide local services. ""It's very overwhelming for every individual in our community, but I have to say we are incredibly lucky to live where we do,"" Hallworth said. ""We are a strong community, and we do come together … in a strong way to help those who are struggling."" gord.howard@niagaradailies.com @gordhoward | 905-225-1626 - COVID-19 in Niagara: What you need to know - Province halts new evictions, postpones scheduled orders due to COVID-19 - Demand for Niagara food banks growing - Homeless shelters adapt to pandemic, prepare to house infected clients SHARE: Report an error Journalistic Standards About The Tribune More from The Tribune & Partners More News Top Stories LOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADS Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Mainly Niagara, an online site started by Niagara Falls resident Sheri Hawkins, will put the spotlight on local talent for the two-hour show starting at 7 p.m. ""I desperately need to do something positive,"" said Hawkins, who lives across the street from Greater Niagara General Hospital. ""There's a palpable tension in the air and there's a capability of (things) getting a bit cagey. ""I've really connected with the artist community in Niagara Falls, and it's like, 'Man, all these people just lost their jobs.'"" The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a state of emergency declared in Ontario, which forbids bars and restaurants from operating (with the exception of takeout orders) and the closure of theatres and concert venues. It has left Niagara performers with virtually nowhere to play. The livestream will act as a fundraiser for both the local performers and the World Health Organization for COVID-19 research. Confirmed to perform are Jessica Wilson, Ryan Lunn, Ashlee Standish, Rafik, Errunhrd, Gravely James, Robert Alfieri and Gavin Ray & Matt Anthony. Levi Mann and Jeffrey Stroop will provide stand-up comedy, Heather Fraser will do live art demonstrations and Local Louie will conduct interviews. ""During this time it's important to stick together as a community,"" said Anthony. ""Music is the world's universal language and by doing this performance, we want to showcase that even in times of distress we can still bring people together."" The whole thing will be hosted by Niagara comedian David Green. The event was originally going to be held at The Warehouse in St. Catharines, closed to the public, but Hawkins made a ""judgment call"" late Thursday to have everyone perform from their homes instead. ""With the change in the social climate every single day and more and more people self-isolating, I just thought 'This won't get better before it gets worse, so I'm just going to livestream it from home.'"" The show is a partnership with livestreaming service Wee Stream, and will be available on Wee Stream' s YouTube channel, Mainly Niagara's website and multiple Facebook pages. It can also be seen on the pages of sponsors, including Livestock Niagara, the Queen Bean Café, Niagara Falls Arts and Culture, Niagara Community Radio, Steve Dainard from Mortgage Architects and Amy Layton from Royal Lepage NRC Realty. Hawkins already has plans for her following livestream event on April 3. ""I think it's necessary to give people something to look forward to,"" she said. ""Because we don't know how long this is going to go on. ""I definitely want to continue this as long as it's needed.""

They are sold and shipped as fast as he can make them. His company manufactures coronavirus testing kits. But Norgen Biotek Corp., on Schmon Parkway in Thorold, faces the same problem as his competitors worldwide: A shortage of supplies. When those become available, he said, ""in two weeks we could triple our capacity . quadruple it"" and hire at least another 50 workers to more than double current staffing levels. Haj-Ahmad founded Norgen, a microbiology firm, in 1998. Early this year it started making kits to collect, isolate and detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus, which has infected nearly 375,000 people and killed more than 16,000 around the world since late December. The problem Norgen and other similar companies face, said Haj-Ahmad, the company president, isn't on the detection side though. It starts with a shortage of swabs, which look like oversized Q-Tips and are inserted deep into a person's nasal cavity to obtain a sample. They are actually made with nylon, according to world standards set by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, one of the major suppliers approved by the CDC to manufacture them - Copan Diagnostics - is based in Italy, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. It has been overwhelmed by demand, especially in its home country, and the swabs' price has increased five-fold already this year, said Haj-Ahmad. Demand also outstrips supply for other materials in the process to collect, isolate and test samples. The one developed by Norgen Biotek takes about four hours. Collection - taking the sample from the nose - is quick. After that, the sample is stored for isolation in a container that kills the virus but not its RNA, or genetic code - similar yet different from DNA and less stable to work with. That takes about an hour (and the plastic tubes required are also in short supply). The final step is a device that amplifies the RNA and provides a positive or negative result. Haj-Ahmad said ""people around the world were caught unprepared"" for COVID-19 and its rapid spread. The problem wasn't knowing a pandemic could happen - that was always a threat. The devil was in the details. ""We never thought about swabs. I could have bought a million swabs in December . it never crossed my mind,"" he said. The virus, which originated in China but has spread around the globe, became known in late December. Norgen Biotek had its test kits available in mid-February, using the supplies it could acquire. Now, governments are scrambling to get those kits from firms like Norgen Biotek. An article on the company appeared recently in a publication in California, he said, and soon after a state representative contacted him hoping to buy kits. ""Nobody is placing an order with us and saying, 'Can you ship it next week?' They want it now,"" said Haj-Ahmad. ""When I was thinking about making the kits, I didn't know we were going to get orders in such huge numbers that we could not meet them,"" said the virologist. ""We focused on the science, but we didn't focus on the supply of the various components. And, by the way, everybody is in the same boat. ""Everybody wants it yesterday. Everybody wants to place an order and they want delivery time as soon as possible."" When there is adequate supplies and the company is ready to hire, he said, it won't be scientists but workers to assemble and pack the kits. He wouldn't put a number of the company's sales, but said it ships worldwide with North America as the priority market.

Another 500 contacts were made through a live online chat service launched last week. Niagara's acting medical officer of health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, said the calls have come from people who feel sick and others wanting information. ""Many of them are people calling concerned that they have symptoms. Some people are just looking for advice if they've travelled and want to know what their risk could be and what to look out for, that sort of thing,"" he said Sunday. Niagara's confirmed cases of COVID-19 remained at four on Sunday and all were travel-related. Across the province, there were five deaths, 412 confirmed positive cases and more than 8,360 cases under investigation as of late Sunday afternoon. Hirji said the province has asked public health not to release local testing numbers. The Niagara Health hospital system said it saw 68 patients at the St. Catharines COVID-19 assessment centre over the weekend and 65 at the Niagara Falls centre. Hirji said with the huge demand in testing, the ability of labs to manage and the global shortage of swabs for testing, health officials have had to prioritize who get tested based on who's most likely to have the infection or if there is a particular need to know, such as the risk of serious complications. Based on the provincial numbers, he said about 1.5 per cent of people tested have positive results. Hirji said one of the most important things people can be doing right now to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is limit travel and stay home for 14 days if they are returning from March break. He said statistics in Ontario show more than 90 per cent of positive cases are linked to travel, while nationally it's at least 75 per cent. ""Travel really is the primary driver right now for this. If the number of travel-related cases of course keep growing, that's going to basically overwhelm the ability of public health to continue containing this,"" he said. While Niagara's cases have been travel-related, other communities in the GTA have seen local transmission. The local public health Novel Coronavirus Info-Line has nurses who can answer questions and operates weekdays 9:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 9:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. It's 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free at 1-888-505-6074.
