Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses provides relief for small businesses experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. It offers unsecured, forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners to: reduce the rent owed by their impacted small business tenants meet operating expenses on commercial properties Property owners must offer a minimum of a 75% rent reduction for the months of April, May and June 2020. Why property owners should apply for CECRA for small businesses? If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses is right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis. Financially, it just makes sense Find out when you can apply Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions – including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over.

To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property* which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure the rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner agrees to apply the loan proceeds, and a declaration of rental revenue included in the attestation The commercial property owner is not and is not controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office. CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation, or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. * We define commercial Real Property as a commercial property with small business tenants. Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. NOTE: Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. What is an impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues ** NOTE: Eligible small business tenants who are in sub-tenancy arrangements are also eligible, if these lease structures meet program criteria. ** Small businesses can compare revenues in April, May and June of 2020 to that of the same period in 2019 to measure revenue losses. They can also use an average of their revenues earned in January and February of 2020. How does the CECRA for small businesses program work? CMHC administers CECRA for small businesses on behalf of the Government of Canada and our provincial and territorial partners. The program offers assistance for the months of April, May and June 2020. Property owners can apply later and the program will be applied retroactively. Property owners may still apply for assistance once the 3-month period has ended if they can prove eligibility during those months. The end date for applications is August 31, 2020. Property owners must use the funds from CECRA to refund amounts in excess of 25% paid by the small business tenant for the period or at the option of the impacted tenant apply rent paid in excess of 25% to future rent owing by the impacted tenant. *** *** If rent has been collected at the time of approval, a credit to the tenant for a future month’s rent (i.e. July for April) is acceptable — if the tenant chooses this option. This can be a flexible 3-month period. The deadline to apply is August 31, 2020. CMHC will provide forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners. Funds will be transferred to the property owner’s financial institution. The loans will cover up to 50% of the monthly gross rent owed by impacted small business tenants during the 3-month period of April, May and June 2020. The property owner will be responsible for no less than half of the remaining 50% of the monthly gross rent payments (paying no less than 25% of the total). The small business tenant will be responsible for no more than half of the remaining 50% of the monthly gross rent payments (paying no more than 25% of the total). Note: If you are a tenant and struggling to pay the remaining portion of your rent, alternate programs are available to assist you. Loan forgiveness CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if the property owner complies with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. FAQS for property owners Why should I apply? There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from your impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses ensures that you get a minimum of 50% of your rent covering April, May and June of 2020 The eviction and new rental process is expensive and those funds affect your profits. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing impacted tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant choses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including any financing held by the property owner operation and maintenance and repair obligations (such as costs of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and utilities) When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful NOTE: If you file for bankruptcy, restructure, reorganize or dissolve your business, you will need to pay back this loan. In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA funding from you (the property owner). How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your small business tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your small business tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. Ultimate parent/owner If the small business tenant or its ultimate owner produces consolidated statements, then the tenant would use revenues reported for the group level of companies. Alternatively, if the small business tenant does not produce consolidated statements, then it is the specific revenue of the tenant that applies for the $20 million test. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the small business tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example: maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example: fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to 3rd parties (for example: property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (e.g., repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Note: applying for insurance coverage does not remove you from being eligible for the program, but it may adjust the amounts received if you successfully receive payments from insurance claims or other programs to cover rent As the Property Owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small business, provided the other program requirements are met. This includes having entered into a lease with the eligible tenant on or before April 1, 2020. What if one of my tenants cannot make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. We aren’t in June yet — should I wait to apply? If I do apply now, will I need to re-apply so that each of my tenant(s) can provide an attestation for June? No, you must apply for all 3 months at the same time and all impacted tenants must be included on a single application. Your tenant can use forecasts for the month of June. The eligibility on the 70% factor will be determined on the average of April, May and then, forecasting June revenues. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there was a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. How do you define commercial Real Property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property with small business tenants. Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS for small business tenants I am a small business tenant and I have paid my rent for April and May. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The loan agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and June rent your property owner will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. For example, the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) supports businesses in meeting their needs to pay for non-deferrable costs during the current period of shut down. Business owners may also be eligible for other credit support programs, such as: funding supported through the EDC Loan Guarantee for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) the BDC Co-Lending Program for SMEs Employers may also be able to take advantage of other measures the government has put in place including deferring GST/HST payments and income taxes. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all of their tenants at once? Yes, your property owner can apply for all impacted tenants at once. If I need to attest to a 70% drop for 3 months, does my landlord need to wait until the end of June to apply? Your landlord must apply for all 3 months at the same time. Your eligibility on the 70% factor will be determined on the average of April, May and then, forecasting June revenues. Can my property owner ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? Your property owner must agree that the rent that is forgiven, reduced and will never be recoverable, collection through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and your property owner. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? If you are a small business, you can calculate your revenue loss by: comparing your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019, or alternatively compared to average gross revenues for January and February 2020 NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from extraordinary items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. These organizations would then be allowed to choose to include revenue from government sources as part of the calculation. Will the program extend beyond June if public health measures remain in effect? CECRA for small businesses is part of the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government continues to assess and respond to the impacts of COVID-19. It stands ready to take additional actions — including CECRA for small businesses — as needed to stabilize the economy and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. Any potential additional actions taken under CECRA for small businesses will be developed in consultation with provincial and territorial governments. Related Programs:  If you aren’t eligible for CECRA for small businesses, the Government of Canada is offering other supports for businesses and individuals as part of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.

Close this window Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses provides relief for small businesses experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. We’ve extended CECRA for small business through the end of July 2020. Property owners and small business tenants will soon be able to access funding for the month of July. What you need to know: Only those tenants approved in the April, May and June application are eligible for the July extension. If a business had an average revenue decline of 70% or more in April, May and June, they are deemed eligible for the additional month of rent relief. However, not all tenants in the original application need to be included for the July extension. To streamline the process and make it easier, we are removing the requirement to claw-back insurance proceeds and provincial rent supports from the CECRA for small businesses forgivable loan amount for both existing and new applicants. Existing applicants who are affected will be notified and will have any previously clawed-back amounts restored to their forgivable loan. Sign up for updates and we'll let you know when you can apply for the extension and how the process will work. Application Process Registration Acknowledge that you and your impacted tenants are eligible. Accept terms and conditions of agreement. Complete form with your corporate information. Confirm your account when you receive your text message. Create security questions. Create your password. Application Upload completed forms: Property Owner Attestation Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Gather the following information: Rent Roll for impacted tenants of the property (only required for properties with more than 5 impacted tenants) Property tax statement for the commercial property Tenant information (total number of full and part-time employees) Copy of recent bank account statement for the subject property (this account is where the funds will be deposited) Your tenant’s business number Approval MCAP or FCT may contact you in the approval process It will take up to 2 weeks for the approval process Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure the rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner agrees to apply the loan proceeds, and a declaration of rental revenue included in the attestation The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation, or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property with small business tenants. Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible small business tenants who are in sub-tenancy arrangements are also eligible, if these lease structures meet program criteria. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. Your June forecast must be supportable by the variables at play for your business. The result is to be guided by the average revenue reduction for April and May and the forecasted change given your respective province or territory’s guiding principles for reopening the economy (i.e. where the impacted business falls in the staged approach). For the 1-month July extension: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the additional 1 month based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June (for example, without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July). Participation in the one-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July rent reduction. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must sign an attestation confirming the information relating to the property owner and the property provided in the application is correct and attest to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent roll for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented, the rent per square foot, their monthly rent and your gross rental income) Applicant information includes: banking information (including bank statement), property owner contact information, co-ownership information and contact details for co-owners Tenant information Tenant information includes: tenant contact information, registered business name, business number, number of employees, lease area and the monthly gross rent for the period of April, May and June TIP: Complete all of your documentation before you fill out the application form in the portal. APPROVAL PROCESS CMHC has engaged MCAP to deliver CECRA for small businesses. MCAP is working with First Canadian Title (FCT) to help deliver CECRA for small businesses. MCAP or FCT may contact you throughout the applicant validation and funding processes. Representatives will be available to answer questions specific to your application. MCAP will notify you within 2 weeks of you application decision. FAQS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS Why should I apply? There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from your impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses ensures that you get a minimum of 50% of your rent covering April, May and June of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and those funds affect your profits. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing impacted tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/pmt of dividends) after reimbursing tenants and applying to property costs When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and so will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement, and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: If you file for bankruptcy, restructure, reorganize or dissolve your business, you will need to pay back this loan. In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes. Short term, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until the later of: 3 months thereafter; or the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before August 31, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant(s) are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond August 31, 2020 the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business (tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease) How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your small business tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your small business tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. Ultimate parent/owner If the small business tenant or its ultimate owner produces consolidated statements, then the tenant would use revenues reported for the group level of companies. Alternatively, if the small business tenant does not produce consolidated statements, then it is the specific revenue of the tenant that applies for the $20 million test. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the small business tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST NOTE: Applying for insurance coverage does not remove you from being eligible for the program, but it may adjust the amounts received if you successfully receive payments from insurance claims or other programs to cover rent. As the Property Owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small business, provided the other program requirements are met. This includes having entered into a lease with the eligible tenant on or before April 1, 2020. What if one of my tenants cannot make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply twice — once for April, May and June and again for the July extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the additional one month based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, i.e., without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July. Participation in the one-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there was a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No, you don’t have to use the rent reduction agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with any impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction that any legal advice that it considers necessary has been obtained How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property with small business tenants. Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS I am a small business tenant and I have paid my rent for April and May. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The loan agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and June rent your property owner will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. For example, the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) supports businesses in meeting their needs to pay for non-deferrable costs during the current period of shut down. Business owners may also be eligible for other credit support programs, such as: funding supported through the EDC Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP) Guarantee for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) the BDC Co-Lending Program for SMEs Employers may also be able to take advantage of other measures the government has put in place including deferring GST/HST payments and income taxes. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July application. However, not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for July. If I need to attest to a 70% drop for 3 months, does my landlord need to wait until the end of June to apply? Your landlord must apply for all 3 months at the same time. Your eligibility on the 70% factor will be determined on the average of April, May and then, forecasting June revenues. Your June forecast must be supportable by the variables at play for your business. The result is to be guided by the average revenue reduction for April and May and the forecasted change given your respective province or territory’s guiding principles for reopening the economy (i.e. where the impacted business falls in the staged approach). Can my property owner ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? Your property owner must agree that the rent that is forgiven, reduced and will never be recoverable, collection through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and your property owner. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. Your June forecast must be supportable by the variables at play for your business. The result is to be guided by the average revenue reduction for April and May and the forecasted change given your respective province or territory’s guiding principles for reopening the economy (i.e. where the impacted business falls in the staged approach). For the 1-month July extension: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the additional one month based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June (for example, without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July). Participation in the one-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July rent reduction. Will the program extend beyond June if public health measures remain in effect? CECRA for small businesses is part of the Government of Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government continues to assess and respond to the impacts of COVID-19. It stands ready to take additional actions — including CECRA for small businesses — as needed to stabilize the economy and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. Any potential additional actions taken under CECRA for small businesses will be developed in consultation with provincial and territorial governments. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June.

Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF). REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must have each eligible small business tenant sign an attestation. Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July and August of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond September 30, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond September 30, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July and August, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 5 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July and August opt-in process. However, not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for July and August. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.

Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF). REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must have each eligible small business tenant sign an attestation. Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July and August of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond September 30, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond September 30, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July and August, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 5 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July and August opt-in process. However, not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for July and August. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.

Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. NOTE: In the event of default, you (the property owner), will be obligated to repay the loan in full. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF). REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must have each eligible small business tenant sign an attestation. Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July, August and September of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond October 31st, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond October 31st, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, August and September, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 6 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July, August and September opt-in process. Not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for the extensions. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.

The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. NOTE: In the event of default, you (the property owner), will be obligated to repay the loan in full. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF).

Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July, August and September of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond October 31st, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond October 31st, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, August and September, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 6 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July, August and September opt-in process. Not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for the extensions. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis. Financially, it just makes sense Contact Us Have questions or need immediate technical assistance with your application? 1-833-610-0515 Have general questions about the program?

Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. NOTE: In the event of default, you (the property owner), will be obligated to repay the loan in full. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF). REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must have each eligible small business tenant sign an attestation. Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

NOTE: If you have already been approved and are interested in the July and August extension, log into the portal and opt-in for July and August. FAQS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS Why should I apply? There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July, August and September of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond October 31st, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond October 31st, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, August and September, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 6 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July, August and September opt-in process. Not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for the extensions. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.

Close this window Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses provides relief for small businesses experiencing financial hardship due to COVID‑19. Opt-in for the CECRA for small businesses extensions OPT IN The deadline to opt-in is October 30, 2020. What You Need Applying for the July, August and September Extensions Anyone who is eligible for CECRA for small businesses is also eligible for the extensions. If you have already been approved for rental assistance Login to the CECRA Portal using your existing username and password. Select “Apply for Extension”. You must request July and August before opting-in for the September extension. Select the tenants you wish to include in the request from the prepopulated list of tenants in your initial application. (You can’t add tenants to the list and can only apply for the extensions once.) Submit your request. Notify your tenants that you have requested the extensions. You have submitted your application and are waiting to hear if it has been approved You may apply for the extensions once you have received an email notification that your existing application has been approved. Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. NOTE: In the event of default, you (the property owner), will be obligated to repay the loan in full. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary.

There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July, August and September of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond October 31st, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond October 31st, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, August and September, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord is just starting the process, they must apply for all 6 months at once — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July, August and September opt-in process. Not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for the extensions. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.

Your loan will be forgiven CECRA for small businesses offers you a forgivable loan worth 50% of the value of your small business’ rent each month. The loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over. NOTE: In the event of default, you (the property owner), will be obligated to repay the loan in full. Program Details ELIGIBILITY To qualify for CECRA for small businesses, the commercial property owner must: own commercial real property which is occupied by one or more impacted small business tenants enter (or have already entered) into a legally binding rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May and June 2020, reducing an impacted small business tenant’s rent by at least 75% ensure that there is a rent reduction agreement for each impacted tenant and sub-tenant and that it includes: a moratorium on eviction for the period during which the property owner applies the loan proceeds, and an acknowledgment that the forgiven rent will never be recoverable The commercial property owner is not: holding federal or provincial political office controlled by an individual holding federal or provincial political office CECRA will not apply to any federal-, provincial-, or municipal-owned properties, where the government is the landlord of the small business tenant. Exceptions Where there is a long-term lease to a First Nation or Indigenous organization or government, the First Nation or Indigenous organization or government is eligible for CECRA for small businesses as a property owner. Where there are long-term commercial leases with third parties to operate the property (for example, airports), the third party is eligible as the property owner. Also eligible are post-secondary institutions, hospitals, and pension funds, as well as crown corporations with limited appropriations designated as eligible under CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: Small businesses that opened on or after March 1, 2020 are not eligible. Properties with or without a mortgage are eligible under CECRA for small businesses. Defining commercial real property We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. Impacted small business tenant? Impacted small business tenants are businesses — including non-profit and charitable organizations — that: pay no more than $50,000 in monthly gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement) generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level) have experienced at least a 70% decline in pre-COVID-19 revenues (at the entity level) NOTE: Eligible impacted small business tenants includes sub-tenants who have a sub-lease within the commercial property. Where there is a sub-lease in place, the property owner would apply for CECRA for small businesses in the same manner as it would for the property owner’s direct tenants. Calculating the 70% reduction in revenues There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible. They can opt-in for the additional months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July, August and September. Participation in the extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. For complete details, please refer to CECRA for small business terms and conditions (in PDF). REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION Property owners will need to provide information in support of their application, sign an attestation and agree to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in order to be eligible for the program. You will find these documents the application portal: Property Owner Attestation Property owners must have each eligible small business tenant sign an attestation. Impacted tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Tenant or Sub-Tenant Attestation Property owners must have each of their eligible commercial small business tenants and/or subtenants sign an attestation. Tenants are responsible for attesting to their eligibility with the program requirements. Rent Reduction Agreement for each impacted tenant Property owners must enter into a legally binding rent reduction agreement with each impacted tenant to confirm the rent reduction in accordance with the program terms and conditions. This agreement is conditional upon final approval of the application for CECRA for small businesses. NOTE: In sub-tenancy arrangements, there must be a rent reduction agreement between: property owner and tenant, and sub-landlord and sub-tenant This ensures the benefit of the CECRA for small businesses flows to all impacted tenants. Forgivable Loan Agreement Property owners must agree to the terms and conditions in the application and outlined in the forgivable loan agreement. You’ll also need to provide the following information: Property owner information Property information includes: property address, property type, property tax statement, latest rent rolls for each property and the number of commercial units (a rent roll should include your tenant and sub-tenants’ unit number, amount of square footage rented and their gross monthly rent).

NOTE: If you have already been approved and are interested in the July and August extension, log into the portal and opt-in for July and August. FAQS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS Why should I apply? There are several reasons that applying for this program could be beneficial for you: CECRA for small businesses loans will be forgiven if you comply with all applicable program terms and conditions — including to not recover forgiven rent amounts from impacted tenants when the program is over. CECRA for small businesses helps ensure that tenants and sub-tenants are able to pay their rent for the period from April, May, June, July, August and September of 2020. The eviction and new rental process is expensive and these associated costs affect your profits. The primary goal is to provide rent relief to impacted small businesses quickly. The program is designed for property owners to support small business tenants operating at the property owner’s location during the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there any rules on how I can use these funds? Yes, in order of priority, you can use the funds for: reimbursing small business tenants for any rent paid above 25% during the eligible period unless the tenant chooses to apply the previously paid rent against future rent any costs and expenses relating directly to the property, including general business purposes (except distribution to shareholders/payment of dividends or bonuses) after reimbursing tenants When will my loan be forgiven? This interest free loan will be forgiven on December 31, 2020. To ensure loan forgiveness, you must follow the terms and conditions of the loan, including: complying with the Rent Reduction Agreement, and ensuring that your attestation and application (including supporting documentation) is accurate and truthful The Loan will automatically be forgiven by CMHC and will not be repayable on December 31, 2020 provided that the property owner has complied with its obligations under the loan agreement and Rent Reduction Agreement. No formal notification of forgiveness will be provided. NOTE: In the event of default, CMHC has full recourse to recover the CECRA for small businesses funding from you (the property owner). Have sales taxes been applied to my loan and/or rental agreements? No, your forgivable loan amount is exempt from sales taxes (GST and HST). NOTE: Sales taxes (GST and HST) are excluded from determining the gross rent amount. The monthly rent amounts are before applicable sales taxes. Do I have an obligation to collect GST/HST from CMHC on the payments received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program? No, as a commercial property owner, you aren’t required to collect GST/HST with respect to payments that you have received from CMHC under the CECRA for small businesses program. If you have any further questions on the application of GST/HST to the CECRA program, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency, GST/HST Technical Enquiries line at 1-800-959-8287. I have impacted tenants that are currently on month-to-month leases — can I apply for them? Yes, month-to-month leases are acceptable if: there was a legally binding lease in place prior to April 1, 2020 the program requirements are met, and the landlord and tenant are each committed to the lease and will remain committed beyond October 31st, 2020. For example, property owner and impacted tenant have a rent reduction agreement in place. The agreement must adhere to the covenants in the loan agreement implying that the monthly rent agreement must continue. The covenant states that the property owner shouldn’t serve any default notices or take steps to evict an impacted tenant from the date of the application until: the date on which the impacted tenant is no longer receiving any rent reduction or forgiveness or rent credit under the Rent Reduction Agreement, where the basis for such default notice or eviction is a lease default due to the COVID-19 emergency I have impacted tenants whose leases are expiring before September 30, 2020, can I still apply for them? Yes, you can still apply for them, provided that: you and your tenant are each committed and will remain committed to the month to month tenancy pursuant to the terms of the lease beyond October 31st, 2020. If the tenant has committed to entering into a new lease to continue to operate its business at a new location, the tenant must provide the program administrator with a copy of the signed lease. The tenant may be eligible for the CECRA for small businesses on an exceptional basis. How is the $20M gross annual revenue threshold calculated and what is the ‘ultimate parent’? Gross annual revenues are calculated based on your impacted tenant’s 2019 financial revenue. Your impacted tenant would use whatever 12-month period their company used to calculate its financials. If the impacted tenant is not an individual and is part of a corporate group, this calculation is made at the consolidated entity level at the highest corporate organizational level. What is included in monthly gross rent? Monthly gross rent is the total gross rent amount payable by the tenant as set out under a valid and enforceable lease agreement. Please see table below for inclusions/exclusions: Included in Gross Rent Net rent / minimum rent / base rent (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of operating costs (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of property taxes payable to the landlord (in a net lease) Regular monthly installments of other additional rent amounts payable to the landlord — for example, promotional funds, maintenance costs, repairs, utilities, management fees, etc. (in a net lease) Gross rent (in a gross lease) Percentage of sales rent paid (if included in the lease arrangement) Excluded from Gross Rent Damages Indemnity payments Payments arising due to tenant default / landlord enforcement Payments arising due to landlord exercise of self-help remedies Interest and penalties on unpaid amounts Fees payable for discrete items or special services (for example, fees to landlord for reviewing plans, supervising work, considering requests for consent, performing exceptional tasks at tenant’s request) Reconciliation adjustment payments Amounts required under the lease agreement to be paid separately by the tenant to third parties (for example, property taxes, utilities, insurers) Costs of non-monetary obligations (for example, repairs and maintenance) Insurance proceeds or proceeds from other rent subsidy programs Sales taxes, including HST As the property owner, am I eligible if I have no declared rental income for 2018 and/or 2019 because my property is new? Yes, where the property is newly constructed or recently purchased, you may be still eligible for CECRA for small businesses, provided the other program requirements are met. What if a tenant can’t make the 25% contribution? CECRA for small businesses offers commercial property owners a forgivable loan of 50% of impacted tenant’s rent during these difficult and uncertain economic times. The Government of Canada offers other programs that may be available to assist tenants who struggle to pay the remaining portion of their rent. Landlords may provide rent forgiveness above the minimum 25% as well or defer payment of the 25%. As a property owner, do I need to provide a declaration for each tenant included in my application? Yes. Property owners will need to obtain an attestation for each impacted tenant asking for help. Do I apply 4 times — once for April, May and June and again for each extension? Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will be able to apply for the extensions based on having a 70% revenue decline for April, May and June, (without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July or August). If you have already opted in for July, you can follow the same process to opt in for August. If you haven’t applied for July, you must opt-in for July and August at the same time. If you are just starting the process you must apply for all 5 months at once. Participation in the extensions is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants are able to apply for the July and August rent reduction. Can I submit multiple applications? Yes, a property owner can submit multiple applications, provided that each application is for a different property. For clarity, you can only apply for the program once per property. As a property owner, you must therefore ensure that you have included all eligible tenants, including sub-tenants, in the respective application, prior to submitting your application. I am a property owner and my small business is the only tenant, can I apply? CECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with a valid and enforceable lease agreement with an impacted small business tenant. Landlords and tenants who are not at arm’s length will be included in the program as long as there is a valid and enforceable lease agreement in place (not created or amended after April 1, 2020) and the rent under the lease is at market rates. All general program requirements apply. This includes confirmation that you have declared rental revenue in your attestation. Do I have to use the sample form of Rent Reduction Agreement? No. While it is preferable to use the standard form, you don’t have to use the agreement provided — but as the property owner of an impacted tenant, it’s your responsibility to ensure that: a rent reduction agreement is in place with the impacted tenant participating in the CECRA Program the rent reduction agreement meets the CECRA Program requirements and the legal requirements of your jurisdiction a Rent Reduction Agreement Rider in included in your own form of rent reduction agreement. The rider will be available in the application portal Note: You must use the Rent Reduction Agreement Rider (provision) if you do not use the Rent Reduction Agreement available in the application portal. How do you define commercial real property? We define commercial real property as a commercial property used for: retail industrial office mixed uses that includes at least one of the above Commercial properties with a residential component and multi-unit residential mixed-use properties would equally be eligible with respect to their small business tenants. FAQS FOR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS I am a small business tenant. How can I be sure that my property owner will forward the CECRA for small businesses funding to me? The rent reduction agreement stipulates that if you have already paid the April, May and/or June rent, the landlord will either, at your choice: reimburse you for rent paid in excess of 25%, or provide you a credit for future rental payments What are my options if my property owner does not apply for the program? The federal government and provincial and territorial governments are urging property owners to provide flexibility to small business tenants facing hardship in this uncertain time. The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship resulting from the global COVID-19 outbreak. CECRA for small businesses is part of these efforts. Learn more about these measures at Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The government will continue to do whatever it takes to support Canadians and the economy during this unprecedented global pandemic. Can my property owner apply for all tenants at once? Yes, your property owner must apply for all impacted tenants operating at a property at once. If you have already received your funding and require rent relief for July, August and September, your property owner must apply for all those impacted tenants receiving an extension at the same time. Participation is voluntary. It works like this: If your landlord has already opted in for July, they can follow the same process to apply for August — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. If your landlord hasn’t applied for July, they must opt-in for July and August at the same time — selecting all impacted tenants at the same time. They can then opt-in for September. Only those tenants already approved in the April, May and June application can be included in the July, August and September opt-in process. Not all tenants in the original applications must be included in the application for the extensions. Can my landlord ask me to pay back the rent at a later date, after the program has ended? No, the landlord must agree that the rent that is forgiven/reduced will never be recoverable or collected through significant or disproportionate rent increases. This will also be within the terms of the rent reduction agreement in place between you and the landlord. NOTE: If you provide any false or misleading information in your attestation, you will be responsible for all rent forgiven under the terms of your lease. My property owner doesn’t have a mortgage — would we still be eligible for the program? Yes. CECRA for small businesses is available to property owners who do not hold a mortgage. I have multiple retail locations and multiple landlords, how would CECRA for small businesses work in this situation? In this situation, each property owner would apply for the program. This means that you need to work with each of your respective property owners who are interested in applying for CECRA for small businesses. How do you calculate the 70% reduction in revenues? There are 2 scenarios by which to calculate your 70% reduction in revenues: If your small business was operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your revenues of April, May and June of 2019. If your small business was not operating during April – June 2019, then compare your average gross revenues from April, May and June of 2020 to your average gross revenues for January and February 2020. NOTE: Your revenue must consist of revenue earned from ordinary activities in Canada. Calculate your revenue using your normal accounting method and exclude revenues from non-recurring items. For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation would include most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm’s length persons. For the July, August and September extensions: Those who qualified for CECRA for small businesses based on existing program parameters will automatically be eligible for the additional 1, 2 or 3 months without reassessing whether they continue to have a 70% revenue decline in July and August. Participation in the 1 or 2-month extension is voluntary. Both existing applicants to CECRA for small businesses and new applicants will be able to apply for the July, August and September rent reduction. SUB-TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS The following table explains how CECRA for small busineses applies to sub-tenancy arrangements. All general program requirements apply for sub-tenants. Rent reduction and loan advance When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the greater of the head lease gross rent or sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by 75% (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of 25% of the head lease gross rent even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Forgivable Loan: Calculated as 50% of the sub-lease gross rent. Rent Reduction Agreements: Back to back rent reduction agreements are entered into as follows: Rent Reduction Agreement #1 (between sub-landlord and sub-tenant) reduces sub-tenant’s gross rent by 75%; and Rent Reduction Agreement #2 (between Property Owner and sub-landlord) reduces sub-landlord’s gross rent by an amount equal to the rent reduction granted under Rent Reduction Agreement #1, which is equal to 75% of the sub-lease gross rent (this calculation is modified as set out below where sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent*). 25% Financial Impact: Property owner assumes a loss of no more than 25% of the head lease gross rent, even where the sub-lease gross rent is greater than the head lease gross rent. Required Documents When both the head tenant (sub-landlord) and sub-tenant are impacted tenants When only the sub-tenant is an impacted small business but the head tenant (sub-landlord) is not an impacted tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by tenant / sub-landlord Attestation by sub-tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between property owner and tenant / sub-landlord, as tenant Rent Reduction Agreement between tenant / sub-landlord, as sub-landlord and sub-tenant Attestation by property owner Attestation by sub-tenant (Note: no attestation is required by a non-impacted tenant) / sub-landlord, only a rent reduction agreement) * Where the sub-lease gross rent is higher than the head lease gross rent, the sub-landlord participates in a portion of the financial loss and a portion of the benefit of the forgivable loan, both attributable to the rent differential between the sub-lease and head lease. The calculation is set out in the rent reduction agreement as follows: the rent reduction amount between the Property Owner and the tenant / sub-landlord is equal to the sum of (i) 75% of the head lease gross rent plus (ii) 50% of the difference between the sub-lease gross rent and the head lease gross rent. WHY HELP YOUR TENANTS AND SUB-TENANTS If you’re a commercial property owner and have small business tenants struggling to make their rent due to the pandemic, CECRA for small businesses may be right for you. Applying for this program can help you and your tenants. Your property depends on the success of your tenants If your small business tenant declares bankruptcy and you have to evict: you will receive zero rental income you will continue to pay mortgage or debt costs on your property, including property tax, maintenance and other costs you’ll have to incur additional costs and go through a lengthy process — often between 6 to 18 months — to find new tenants you risk having to rent your space out at a lower cost post-pandemic If you have to replace a small business tenant, you end up paying a lot of cash out You need to evict your tenant and may incur legal and other expenses to do so. You still need to pay the mortgage on the property. It generally takes about 6 months to re-lease a space ($60,000 lost revenues). With CECRA for small businesses, you still collect a portion of your gross rent For a business tenant paying $10,000 per month: CECRA for small businesses will cover 50% of the rent ($5,000). Your tenant will pay up to 25% of the rent ($2,500). You forgive 25% of the rent ($2,500). This means you get up to 75% of the rent or $7,500 of rent per month for April, May and June. This adds up to $22,500 over the course of the program. It also provides your tenants breathing room to recover and remain viable post-crisis.
