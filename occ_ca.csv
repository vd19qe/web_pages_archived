They are critical in helping Canada turn the corner on COVID-19 and their success is essential to Canada’s economic strength. Created and launched by RBC, Canada United is a national movement to support local businesses in communities across the country. Today, during Small Business Week, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, announced an investment of $12 million to support the Canada United Small Business Relief Fund. “By teaming up with the Canada United campaign, our government is able to give yet another lifeline for small businesses during Small Business Week,” said the Honourable Mary Ng, Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade. “On the road to economic recovery, we will continue to do whatever it takes to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in every corner of the country.” The pandemic has created substantial uncertainty for small businesses. They are facing mounting losses, increased costs to reopen and shaky consumer confidence. As part of the Canada United movement, RBC brought together more than 70 of Canada’s leading brands, the national Chamber of Commerce network and business associations to rally Canadians to “show local some love” by buying, dining and shopping local. Meanwhile, more than 40 municipalities across Canada made official proclamations in honor of the Canada United Weekend, which took place over the weekend of August 28 – 30. “Small businesses are cornerstones of our local economies and key to thriving communities—creating jobs, driving innovation, and generating wealth for Canadians. Local businesses have always been there for us and now need our support now more than ever. A sincere thanks to Minister Ng and the federal government for providing critical support to small businesses when they need it most,” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The actions of Canadians during the campaign helped establish the Canada United Small Business Relief Fund to help small businesses offset the cost of expenses required to reopen safely or adopt digital technologies to move more of their business online. “While the pandemic has undoubtedly challenged us in many ways, it’s also highlighted Canadians’ unwavering commitment to supporting one another during difficult times,” said Neil McLaughlin, Group Head, Personal & Commercial Banking, RBC. “We are incredibly grateful for the ways Canadians have supported their local businesses when they really needed it, and for the commitment of our partners who helped bring Canada United to life. And, now, with the Federal Government’s support, we are confident that the Small Business Relief Fund will make a significant difference in helping businesses prepare for the road ahead.” Through the Canada United Small Business Relief Fund, grants up to $5,000 are available to small businesses so they can cover the costs of physical modifications to their businesses to meet local health and safety requirements. The grant can also be used to help firms with the cost of Personal Protection Equipment and enhance their e-commerce capabilities so they can do more business online. Canadian small businesses can learn more and apply for the grant online. “The Canada United Small Business Relief Fund is helping our small businesses offset the cost required to reopen safely or adopt digital technologies to move more of their business online at a time when they need it most. Chambers of commerce and boards of trade from coast, to coast, to coast have come together to start the Canada United movement, to show local businesses all the support they deserve,” added Perrin Beatty, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce The new application window will for the Canada United Small Business Relief Fund will be open on Monday, October 26, 2020.

However, if businesses are asked to shut down through no fault of their own or if public health units implore citizens not to leave their homes, our economic stability remains at stake, regardless of regional restrictions. To make this work, Ontario’s business community needs fair, consistent, clear guidelines and support. “We are grateful for the response from all levels of government to help protect public health while safeguarding Ontario businesses and their employees. However, we have heard clearly from our members with respect to confusing and inconsistent public health guidelines; a lack of testing and tracing capacity; insufficient data on the sources of community spread; and a lack of timely and accessible supports for business. “We call for a swift, fair and evidence-based response to COVID-19 for Ontario business, along with clear guidelines and adequate supports to all those impacted during this crisis.” -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

The OER is a data-driven, evidence-based document rooted in the OCC’s annual survey of its members, the Business Confidence Survey (BCS). This year, the data and content contained within the OER reflects the unprecedented year that was 2020 and the unpredictability of 2021, examining the economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disproportionate impacts it has had on certain businesses and individuals in Ontario.

The health and safety of all Ontarians remains our top priority because we know we can’t have a healthy economy without a healthy workforce. To support businesses during this difficult period, our government is providing significant financial support, including through the Ontario Small Business Support Grant. This program provides a minimum of $10,000 and up to $20,000 to help offset a variety of costs, including personal protective equipment, rent, wages, hydro, and property taxes. We are also laying the groundwork for our long-term recovery with critical investments in broadband, transit, and highways. We will always have the backs of our business owners. I am confident that, with the help of great partners like the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and its members, our economy will come back with a vengeance when this crisis is over. Because tough times don’t last, but tough people do.” – Premier of Ontario, Leader, Ontario Progressive Conservative Party “The past year has been hard on Ontario businesses, especially small businesses. Thank you to the Ontario Chamber for the work they do in support of business of all sizes across the province. I’ve been advocating for direct financial support for businesses so they have a fighting chance to survive the pandemic. As we begin to think about recovery, we have to ensure that we leverage the opportunities that a greener and more caring economy can offer. We must learn from the lessons of the pandemic and work to ensure our businesses can recover and thrive once more.” – Mike Schreiner, Leader, Ontario Green Party “Through unprecedented challenges, Ontario’s business community continues to show its strength and resiliency, thanks to an amazing workforce and strong advocates like the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. As the son of a former small business owner, I understand how difficult these times are, and I will continue to fight for more support so that businesses can survive and thrive through the recovery from COVID-19.” – Steven Del Duca, Leader, Ontario Liberal Party “People and local businesses have done their part during the pandemic with the support and resources of chambers of commerce and boards of trade. They kept as many people on the payroll as they could, kept supply chains moving, and worked hard to stop the spread. I believe they deserve a government that does its part, too, by investing in the survival of Ontario businesses and jobs today, and laying the groundwork for a post-pandemic comeback that unlocks Ontario’s potential.” – Andrea Horwath, Leader, Ontario New Democratic Party “The OCC’s Ontario Economic Report provides valuable insight into the challenges Ontario businesses have faced during the pandemic. As a key partner in supporting economic recovery, Hydro One will continue to advocate for customers and businesses while collaborating with industry, government and municipalities to spark economic growth. Through our Ontario-focused strategy, we will continue to energize life and strengthen local economies by investing in a resilient, safe and reliable electricity system.” – Mark Poweska, President and CEO, Hydro One. “In the face of unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the OCC has provided leadership, advocacy and pragmatic solutions that kept us all safer and helped businesses stay stronger. Now as we look to economic recovery in the months and years ahead, the findings presented in the Ontario Economic Report are a starting point to align the actions we need to take to pave the road back to prosperity.” – Michael W.

Public policy makers looking at strategies to support Ontario’s long-term economic recovery will benefit from the findings outlined in the OCC’s flagship annual report. “The current health and economic crises have had a considerable negative impact on our economy. Only 21 percent of businesses are confident in Ontario’s economic outlook—a historic low—reflecting the stark reality in which businesses continue to grapple with the financial and logistical challenges of operating under a pandemic,” says Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The 2021 OER uncovers the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on small businesses and entrepreneurs as well as specific regions, sectors, and demographics, highlighting the major vulnerabilities and opportunities Ontario will face in the year ahead. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are least confident in the province’s economy, as they continue to face unprecedented liquidity constraints, increased costs, and reduced revenues. Many businesses have already had to shut their doors indefinitely,” added Rossi. This year’s OER also reveals the hardest-hit sectors were those requiring considerable face-to-face contact, namely: accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment, and recreation; and retail. Findings indicate that employment growth declined throughout the province with women, lower-income, racialized, new immigrant, and younger Ontarians suffering the biggest job losses. Every region of the province felt the impacts of the recession, though some considerably more than others. The report’s co-author, Daniel Safayeni, Acting Vice President of Policy at the OCC, added: “No business, region, sector, or demographic should be left behind in the pursuit of economic recovery and growth. Support programs and pro-growth policies should be targeted towards those experiencing the most pronounced challenges. A focus on reskilling as well as widespread access to broadband infrastructure and capital will be necessary to the revival of small business and entrepreneurship as well as an inclusive and robust economic recovery.” Key highlights from the OER include: Ontario witnessed a steep decline in real GDP growth (-5.6 percent) in 2020 but is projected to see a moderate rebound of 4.8 percent in 2021, fuelled largely in part by expectations for vaccination rollout and the eventual re-opening of the economy. In 2020, only 21 percent of survey respondents expressed confidence in Ontario’s economic outlook. Less than half of Ontario businesses (48 percent) are confident in the outlook of their own organizations over the next year. Small businesses are more pessimistic about Ontario’s outlook than larger ones. Only 20 percent of small businesses expressed confidence in Ontario’s economy, compared to 27 percent of medium and large businesses. The majority (58 percent) of survey respondents said their organizations shrank between April and September, while only 17 percent grew. Employment growth declined throughout the province in 2020, with 47 percent of organizations indicating they let employees go due to COVID-19. Sectors most negatively impacted by the crisis included: accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment, and recreation; and retail. Businesses in these sectors were among those most pessimistic about the economic outlook and most likely to have shrunk and let go of staff in 2020. Businesses’ priorities for governments during economic recovery included enhancing access to capital, reforming business taxes, encouraging Ontarians to buy local, and investing in broadband infrastructure. “The prolonged nature of the crisis, rising case counts, and uncertainty around vaccine deployment timelines have taken a toll on employers and Ontarians across the province. Yet, Ontario has a proven track-record of resilience and recovery. Our long-term prosperity will depend on all levels of government, business, chambers of commerce and boards of trade working together towards economic recovery,” added Rossi. “The OCC’s Ontario Economic Report provides valuable insight into the challenges Ontario businesses have faced during the pandemic. As a key partner in supporting economic recovery, Hydro One will continue to advocate for customers and businesses while collaborating with industry, government and municipalities to spark economic growth,” said Mark Poweska, President and CEO of Hydro One. “Through our Ontario-focused strategy, we will continue to energize life and strengthen local economies by investing in a resilient, safe and reliable electricity system.” The Ontario Economic Report was made possible by support from Hydro One. Read the Ontario Economic Report. Leader Quotes “COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on many businesses of all sizes. The health and safety of all Ontarians remains our top priority because we know we can’t have a healthy economy without a healthy workforce. To support businesses during this difficult period, our government is providing significant financial support, including through the Ontario Small Business Support Grant. This program provides a minimum of $10,000 and up to $20,000 to help offset a variety of costs, including personal protective equipment, rent, wages, hydro, and property taxes. We are also laying the groundwork for our long-term recovery with critical investments in broadband, transit, and highways. We will always have the backs of our business owners. I am confident that, with the help of great partners like the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and its members, our economy will come back with a vengeance when this crisis is over. Because tough times don’t last, but tough people do.” – Premier of Ontario, Leader, Ontario Progressive Conservative Party “People and local businesses have done their part during the pandemic with the support and resources of chambers of commerce and boards of trade. They kept as many people on the payroll as they could, kept supply chains moving, and worked hard to stop the spread. I believe they deserve a government that does its part, too, by investing in the survival of Ontario businesses and jobs today, and laying the groundwork for a post-pandemic comeback that unlocks Ontario’s potential.” – Andrea Horwath, Leader, Ontario New Democratic Party “Through unprecedented challenges, Ontario’s business community continues to show its strength and resiliency, thanks to an amazing workforce and strong advocates like the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. As the son of a former small business owner, I understand how difficult these times are, and I will continue to fight for more support so that businesses can survive and thrive through the recovery from COVID-19.” – Steven Del Duca, Leader, Ontario Liberal Party “The past year has been hard on Ontario businesses, especially small businesses. Thank you to the Ontario Chamber for the work they do in support of business of all sizes across the province. I’ve been advocating for direct financial support for businesses so they have a fighting chance to survive the pandemic. As we begin to think about recovery, we have to ensure that we leverage the opportunities that a greener and more caring economy can offer. We must learn from the lessons of the pandemic and work to ensure our businesses can recover and thrive once more.” – Mike Schreiner, Leader, Ontario Green Party — 30 — About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

Many business owners are struggling to wrap their heads around requirements and health protocols and scrambling to hire, re-hire, or lay-off staff to no fault of their own. There is no easy on or off switch for employers; the lack of predictability and clarity in government decisions makes it difficult for businesses to plan effectively and invest in the necessary infrastructure for a safe re-opening. Ultimately, business owners and their workers are the collateral damage from misalignment between regional public health units and different orders of government. “We are at an inflection point and getting this right is critical. As we have said from the outset of the crisis, prioritizing public health is our best long-term economic strategy. You cannot restart the economy without control of the virus, particularly with consumer confidence at an all time low and new strains of the virus aggressively spreading across Ontario. “A new spike in cases could trigger another full provincial lockdown, prolong the crisis, and further depress consumer confidence. That is why clear and consistent communication and guidelines will be critical determinants of the plan’s, and by extension Ontario’s, success.” -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

The submission calls for policies that minimize the impacts of business closures, uplift the sectors and demographics hit hardest by the pandemic, invest in the infrastructure and workforce of the future, and modernize government services to improve outcomes for businesses and residents. “With Ontario’s economy expected to enter a period of recovery this year as vaccines are distributed and businesses begin to reopen, resources need to be focused on where they will have the greatest impact.” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “In the upcoming budget, we would like to see a focus on reskilling, broadband, and access to capital, which will be necessary for the revival of small business and entrepreneurship as well as an inclusive economic recovery.” In 2021, Ontario will continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. The OCC’s submission notes the crisis has created new problems and exacerbated pre-existing ones. The impact on people and business has been catastrophic overall, and disproportionate for certain regions, sectors, and demographics. “Resources should be targeted towards the sectors and communities that have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, including industries requiring face-to-face contact, small businesses, municipal governments, as well as women, lower-income, racialized, elderly, new immigrant, and younger Ontarians,” added Rossi. The recommendations outlined in the submission were developed together with businesses, post-secondary institutions, chambers of commerce, and boards of trade. The submission focuses on mitigating the immediate impacts of the crisis, while laying the groundwork for a robust and sustainable economic recovery.

Resources need to be focused on those hit hardest by the pandemic, where they will have the greatest impact. Some of the things called for in the OCC’s pre-Budget Submission included: Targeted support for the hardest-hit sectors and communities; Demand-driven skills programming; Enhanced access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs; Bold action on interprovincial trade; Strengthening of municipalities’ fiscal capacity; and A sensible path to getting Ontario’s finances on track post-pandemic. “Women’s fulsome participation in the labour market is a precondition to our economic recovery and future prosperity. We greatly appreciate the new supports for women, as they have been among those disproportionately impacted by the crisis,” said the report’s author Claudia Dessanti, Senior Policy Analyst, Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “A taskforce for inclusive economic growth, further supports for child care, a job training tax credit, relief for the tourism industry, and support for survivors of domestic violence are all welcome initiatives that will help turn the tides on the impacts that were so severe and immediate for women in Ontario. Budget 2021 addresses many of the supports we called for in our recent report, The She-Covery Project: Confronting the Gendered Economic Impacts of COVID-19 in Ontario.” Some of the measures welcomed by the OCC in the 2021 Budget are: Support for inclusive growth: A taskforce for inclusive economic growth. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected women, racialized individuals, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and other communities in the province. The new taskforce will examine how to increase women’s participation in the workforce, which will support economic recovery. Temporary Job Training Tax Credit. Studies suggest about half a million jobs are not expected to return in Canada after the pandemic, the majority of which are occupied by women. Financial support for underemployed individuals to access training and reskilling will be particularly important for lower-income workers, new immigrants, and Ontarians living in Indigenous, rural, remote, and northern communities. Child care support. Access to affordable child care is a long-standing issue that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Enhancing the CARE tax credit for 2021, extending financial support for virtual learning costs, and investing in new child care spots will help ease the burden for Ontario families and allow more women to re-enter the workforce. Supports for women fleeing domestic violence. The increase in domestic violence incidences during the pandemic has forced many women to leave their homes and communities, jeopardizing their safety and livelihood. Support for women in transitional housing and underserved areas will help provide safety for women in vulnerable situations. Supports for business: Doubling of the Ontario Small Business Support Grant. The grant has helped many organizations survive the crisis thus far and making this an automatic top-up instead of asking businesses to re-apply will reduce the administrative burden on both businesses and government. Additional resources for the Digital Main Street Grant. Many small businesses, particularly in rural and remote regions, have benefited from the supports of this grant to get their business online. Expanding the program will help more businesses digitize and prepare for the economy of tomorrow. Invest Ontario Fund. Additional funding in Invest Ontario over the next four years will be important to create jobs and investment across the province. Support for tourism: Tourism and Hospitality Small Business Support Grant. The OCC recently wrote to the Ontario government about how the tourism industry is not eligible for the Ontario Small Business Support Grant. This new grant is welcome news for hotels, travel agencies, hunting and fishing camps, and other organizations that did not qualify for the original grant. Local Tourism Tax Credit and Tourism Recovery Program. Many of the chambers of commerce and boards of trade are active in the tourism industries within their local communities. These additional supports will be critical to support a revival of tourism after the pandemic. Support for alcohol producers & local distilleries. Ontario’s vineyards, cideries, and small distillers have been greatly impacted by the pandemic as tourism stalled this year. Support for communities and municipalities: Broadband investments. The pandemic has put the spotlight on the digital divide for people and businesses, particularly in remote and rural communities. Additional funding to connect all Ontarians, including businesses, to reliable broadband by 2025 is welcome news. Regional Opportunities Tax Credit. Additional resources towards this program will allow rural and remote communities to invest in projects that create local jobs and economic growth. Property reassessment for municipalities. Pausing the property tax reassessment gives municipalities and businesses more capacity and time to adjust to the economic uncertainty and challenges caused by the pandemic. Expansion of the Ontario Together Fund. The Ontario Together Fund has successfully leveraged Ontario’s business community to address pandemic-related challenges and support relief efforts. Access to vaccination appointments. The OCC welcomes support to help seniors and people with disabilities get to their vaccination appointments. The faster the population is inoculated, the sooner we can focus on recovery. Strategic Priorities and Infrastructure Fund. Renovations to local buildings and sports facilities will also be integral to local economic growth and recovery initiatives.

The Network, which comprises leadership from 140 chambers of commerce and boards of trade from across the province, will be meeting with all four of Ontario’s political leaders and one-on-one with key economic caucus members in March. The Chamber Advocacy Series takes place just ahead of Ontario’s 2021 Budget and discussions will build on the themes in the OCC’s pre-Budget submission: recovery, growth, and modernization. “With Ontario’s economy expected to enter a period of recovery later this year, resources need to be focused on the hardest-hit sectors and communities where they will have the greatest impact.” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “In the upcoming budget, we would like to see a focus on reskilling, broadband, and access to capital, which will be necessary for the revival of small business and entrepreneurship as well as an inclusive economic recovery.” In 2021, Ontario will continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. The OCC’s submission notes the crisis has created new problems and exacerbated pre-existing ones. The impact on people and business has been catastrophic overall, and disproportionate for certain regions, sectors, and demographics. During its Advocacy Series, the Network will emphasize that the province should: Target recovery funding towards the hardest-hit sectors; Develop demand-driven skills programming; and Be bold on interprovincial trade. “Our 2021 Ontario Economic Report noted industries requiring face-to-face contact, small businesses, as well as women, lower-income, racialized, elderly, new immigrant, and younger Ontarians have been unduly impacted and effective government policy must account for this” added Rossi. The recommendations outlined in the submission were developed together with businesses, post-secondary institutions, chambers of commerce, and boards of trade. The submission focuses on mitigating the immediate impacts of the crisis, while laying the groundwork for a robust, sustainable and inclusive economic recovery.

Resources need to be focused on those hit hardest by the pandemic, where they will have the greatest impact. Some of the things called for in the OCC’s pre-Budget Submission included: Targeted support for the hardest-hit sectors and communities; Demand-driven skills programming; Enhanced access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs; Bold action on interprovincial trade; Strengthening of municipalities’ fiscal capacity; and A sensible path to getting Ontario’s finances on track post-pandemic. “Women’s fulsome participation in the labour market is a precondition to our economic recovery and future prosperity. We greatly appreciate the new supports for women, as they have been among those disproportionately impacted by the crisis,” said the report’s author Claudia Dessanti, Senior Policy Analyst, Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “A taskforce for inclusive economic growth, further supports for child care, a job training tax credit, relief for the tourism industry, and support for survivors of domestic violence are all welcome initiatives that will help turn the tides on the impacts that were so severe and immediate for women in Ontario. Budget 2021 addresses many of the supports we called for in our recent report, The She-Covery Project: Confronting the Gendered Economic Impacts of COVID-19 in Ontario.” Some of the measures welcomed by the OCC in the 2021 Budget are: Support for inclusive growth: A taskforce for inclusive economic growth. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected women, racialized individuals, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and other communities in the province. The new taskforce will examine how to increase women’s participation in the workforce, which will support economic recovery. Temporary Job Training Tax Credit. Studies suggest about half a million jobs are not expected to return in Canada after the pandemic, the majority of which are occupied by women. Financial support for underemployed individuals to access training and reskilling will be particularly important for lower-income workers, new immigrants, and Ontarians living in Indigenous, rural, remote, and northern communities. Child care support. Access to affordable child care is a long-standing issue that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Enhancing the CARE tax credit for 2021, extending financial support for virtual learning costs, and investing in new child care spots will help ease the burden for Ontario families and allow more women to re-enter the workforce. Supports for women fleeing domestic violence. The increase in domestic violence incidences during the pandemic has forced many women to leave their homes and communities, jeopardizing their safety and livelihood. Support for women in transitional housing and underserved areas will help provide safety for women in vulnerable situations. Supports for business: Doubling of the Ontario Small Business Support Grant. The grant has helped many organizations survive the crisis thus far and making this an automatic top-up instead of asking businesses to re-apply will reduce the administrative burden on both businesses and government. Additional resources for the Digital Main Street Grant. Many small businesses, particularly in rural and remote regions, have benefited from the supports of this grant to get their business online. Expanding the program will help more businesses digitize and prepare for the economy of tomorrow. Invest Ontario Fund. Additional funding in Invest Ontario over the next four years will be important to create jobs and investment across the province. Support for tourism: Tourism and Hospitality Small Business Support Grant. The OCC recently wrote to the Ontario government about how the tourism industry is not eligible for the Ontario Small Business Support Grant.

We are proud to support the Private Member’s Bill introduced today by Ontario NDP Critic for Finance and Treasury Board, Catherine Fife. The Act seeks to recognize and promote the importance of diversity amongst government vendors. “As the largest customers in the economy, governments have tremendous power to incentivize suppliers. Currently, Ontario’s public-sector request for proposal processes are driven almost entirely by short-term cost considerations. “Both the Governments of Ontario and Canada should adjust their procurement processes to expand opportunities for diverse businesses and suppliers that champion diversity. Changing the incentive structures is the most powerful way to change outcomes. “Supplier diversity has been shown to increase innovation, reduce risk, and open new opportunities for economic development. This is an important issue for the OCC and that is why we hosted our inaugural Business Diversity Expo last year where we showcased companies owned and operated by diverse-represented groups to meet with supply chain leaders from large private sector, public sector and academic institutions. We also underscore the importance of supplier diversity in our recent report, The She-Covery Project: Confronting the Gendered Economic Impacts of COVID-19 in Ontario. – 30 – About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

The latest report by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC), Growing a More Resilient Food Supply Chain in Ontario, outlines why public policymakers need to take note and take action on issues such as rising food insecurity and food fraud as well as supporting the demand for local food and the shift to online sales to help grow a stronger agri-food sector. “COVID-19 brought our agri-food system and supply chains to the forefront. We can all remember food flying off the shelves due to stockpiling and panic buying at the outset of the pandemic. Ultimately, while the pandemic caused parts of Ontario’s food supply chain to bend, the chain itself did not break,” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The report examines issues that emerged in the last 12 months and other longstanding ones that were exacerbated by COVID-19. It explains how Canada’s food system continued to provide Canadians with uninterrupted access to food throughout the pandemic due to the strength of the many sub-sectors and businesses that make up the food supply chain. However, the pandemic put a spotlight on why we need to take action – so the system never gets to a breaking point. “Addressing red tape and labour shortages among farmers, as well as tackling food fraud and food insecurity, will not only ensure Canada’s agri-food sector is able to withstand future challenges, but it will also support agri-food businesses and an equitable recovery,” added Rossi. The recommendations outlined in Growing a More Resilient Food Supply Chain aim to strengthen the agri-food sector – a sector that is not only a significant economic driver in Ontario and Canada but also a competitive advantage. Specifically, the report makes a series of recommendations aimed at federal and provincial policymakers: Meet the demand for local food and shift to online sales by continuing to invest in relevant programs that help producers transition to e-commerce; Improve the AgriStability program by increasing the payment cap and payment trigger, and processing claims more quickly; Remove red tape facing farmers, including inter-provincial trade barriers for meat and meat products; Support the next generation of farmers by attracting youth to the sector and reducing other barriers to entry like access to land and capital; Curb food fraud through improved seafood labelling and a pragmatic plan; and Eliminate food insecurity by collecting data, setting targets, and investing in road development in Indigenous and remote communities. Read the policy brief: Growing a More Resilient Food Supply Chain in Ontario. Quotes “The agri-food sector contributes over $47 billion to the annual GDP and supports over 860,000 jobs across the province. The pandemic has awakened Ontarians’ interest in local food and increased their appreciation for farmers. These producers quickly pivoted at the start of the pandemic and have continued to provide consumers with uninterrupted access to fresh, nutritious, and safe food during this crisis. Given the labour shortage facing the agricultural sector, the province needs to raise awareness of our sector and encourage young people to consider a career in this vibrant and tech-driven sector.” – Cathy Lennon, General Manager, Ontario Federation of Agriculture “Put simply, farming has become increasingly risky and costly in recent years. The risks facing local producers have markedly changed. Ontario farmers need well-funded government programs that mitigate risks, provide timely support, and preserve the strength of the agricultural sector. The core business risk management program in Ontario – the AgriStability program – requires several reforms to better meet this new reality.” – Richard Horne, Executive Director of the Beef Farmers of Ontario “The economic downturn brought on by COVID-19 has increased food insecurity across the country. Community Food Centres Canada estimates that one in seven Canadians are skipping meals or going entire days without eating – a situation that has severe and long-term health and mental health implications. Bold solutions are needed, and that includes increasing access to innovative programs, facilities, and expertise that will continue to improve access to fresh, local food across Ontario.” – Tony Doyle, Dean, W. Galen Weston Centre for Food, Durham College This policy brief was made possible by support from Beef Farmers of Ontario, Durham College, and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce Together with almost 140 member chambers of commerce and boards of trade and our network’s diverse 60,000 members, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce is the indispensable partner of business.

We are urging the Ontario government not to phase out gas-fired electricity so that industry can adequately balance environmental and economic objectives in Ontario. “Since phasing out coal-fired generation, Ontario has one of the cleanest electricity systems in North America. Eliminating gas-fired generation now would not only undermine the flexibility and affordability of our energy system, but it is also not an effective or practical approach to further reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “The OCC and CME firmly believe Ontario needs a well-balanced energy system. Electricity only accounts for about 3 percent of Ontario’s emissions, with the main sources being transportation, industry, and buildings. Further decarbonization can be achieved most cost-effectively by leveraging existing and emerging technologies, including hydrogen, renewable natural gas, energy storage, small modular reactors, and geothermal energy. “Currently, natural gas is the only resource capable of meeting peak demand periods year-round. New nuclear, renewable energy, energy storage, and other assets may all be part of the solution in the future. Until then, demand growth over the next decade will require flexible assets that can be readily deployed, particularly as the economy expands and nuclear generators undergo refurbishment. “Importing hydro from other provinces is also not an option as existing transmission lines will not provide sufficient capacity and expanding that capacity will require long lead times. Further, Québec is forecasting its own supply challenges over the next decade as it uses electrification to curb emissions. “We are also deeply concerned about affordability. Replacing the more than 11,300 MW of transmission-connected gas-fired generators in Ontario by 2030 – or nearly a third of total installed supply capacity across the province – will cost in the tens of billions of dollars for businesses and residents. This will have devastating implications for ratepayers and/or taxpayers as Ontario faces post-pandemic economic recovery.” – 30 – About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

This Playbook will provide Ontario’s business community with the resources needed to support mental wellness in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. “COVID-19 is having a significant negative impact on Ontarians’ mental health and many workplaces are looking for resources to help support their employees,” says Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. “We are proud to partner with Sun Life and leverage their expertise to support businesses in their efforts to improve wellbeing and productivity, and make a meaningful impact in the lives of their employees.” Numerous studies confirm Ontarians are struggling during this crisis. Angus Reid’s survey[i] found most Ontarians are experiencing some level of stress and concern about their personal finances (73 percent and 63 percent respectively). Nanos also found[ii] most Ontarians (52 percent) have experienced difficulties accessing the support of a psychologist in the past year. The Canadian Mental Health Association’s latest survey[iii] revealed almost 80 percent of Ontarians believe the province will face a serious mental health crisis – or an echo pandemic – as it emerges from COVID-19. Sun Life covers over three million employees and their families in Canada. Each year they support the health care needs of Canadians, with more than 75 million claims paid and more than 50 million health touchpoints. “As the pressures of the pandemic continue, the need for accessible mental health resources is critical. Workplaces play an important role in the health and wellbeing of employees and dependents,” said Jacques Goulet, President, Sun Life Canada. “This Playbook will be a valuable resource to businesses across the province. It will equip employers with information to support their employees. The Playbook will complement Sun Life’s mental health tool kit, a free guide to help organizations build their own workplace mental health strategy.” The Chamber’s Playbook will provide Ontario businesses with a list of resources so employers have tools at their disposal to develop mental health strategies and psychologically healthy and safe workplaces. The OCC will also prepare a summary document that includes information and resources tailored to small businesses and entrepreneurs. Both resources will be released this summer and available to employers and businesses through the OCC’s website and social media channels. The OCC and Sun Life will be holding two virtual consultations this month to hear directly from members, small businesses, and mental health subject matter experts about the challenges employers and employees have experienced in the past 13-months and what supports are needed.

We have also continued to ask for more notice when public health measures change. The frustration from business owners has been palpable as they try to decide whether or not to invest in the necessary health and safety supplies, rehiring, inventory and planning required to reopen their operations. “The same type of transparency needs to be applied to communications around AstraZeneca. It is still unclear when Ontarians who received a first dose will receive their second shot. “We call on the Province to help restore public and business confidence in the government’s management of the COVID-19 crisis by providing Ontarians with clarity on: Evidence-based metrics for reopening, namely thresholds related to daily case counts, capacity within our healthcare system, and how rapidly the virus is spreading. For instance, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer said he would like to see the number of new daily COVID-19 cases for Ontario “well below” 1,000 before easing public health restrictions. Will this be the threshold for reopening? When and how Ontarians who received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will receive their second dose, or at least when that decision will be made and what information it will be based on. How public health measures will adapt when the majority of Ontarians will have received their first vaccine dose. For instance, other jurisdictions like Saskatchewan have provided a clear plan and roadmap for what can open and when, accompanied by an expected timeline. “We fully appreciate the need to be nimble and agile in responding to a crisis that is evolving rapidly; however, this flexibility should not preclude the government from providing Ontarians with a clear understanding about the key metrics and thresholds for a measured, safe, and carefully calibrated reopening plan.” -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

Through this initiative, participating chambers of commerce and boards of trade will roll out free rapid tests for small- and medium-sized businesses in communities across the province. “Rapid testing is one of the key ways to keep workplaces as safe as possible during the pandemic as we wait for vaccinations to roll out. It will be an essential part of curbing the spread of COVID-19 in our communities so that we can get on the path to economic recovery faster,” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The COVID-19 Rapid Screening Initiative will provide free rapid antigen tests for employees of small and medium-sized businesses. The tests will be distributed through participating local chambers of commerce and boards of trade in Ontario. Businesses (including non-chamber members) with 150 employees or less are welcome to participate in this program. The goal of the program is to identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the workplace that might otherwise be missed, helping to curb the spread in the workplace, at home and around the community. “As the indispensable partner of business, we are proud that many of our member chambers of commerce and boards of trade will be offering this program, distributing rapid tests to small and local businesses across the province. Over 760,000 rapid tests will be going out to communities across Ontario with 28 of our chambers participating in rolling this program out,” added Rossi. The Initiative was first successfully piloted in the Waterloo region by the Greater Kitchener Waterloo and Cambridge Chambers of Commerce in partnership with Communitech, the Government of Ontario, and Government of Canada. Through this pilot, the chambers have delivered 120,000 kits to nearly 1,400 businesses in the region. This means that up to 30,000 employees in essential workplaces are receiving regular screening twice weekly in the Waterloo region. The COVID-19 Rapid Screening Initiative builds upon the success of this existing program and delivers tests into the hands of small and medium-sized businesses across the province.

More chambers of commerce and boards of trade will be joining in the coming weeks. -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

We are urging the Ontario government not to phase out gas-fired electricity so that industry can adequately balance environmental and economic objectives in Ontario. “Since phasing out coal-fired generation, Ontario has one of the cleanest electricity systems in North America. Eliminating gas-fired generation now would not only undermine the flexibility and affordability of our energy system, but it is also not an effective or practical approach to further reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “The OCC and CME firmly believe Ontario needs a well-balanced energy system. Electricity only accounts for about 3 percent of Ontario’s emissions, with the main sources being transportation, industry, and buildings. Further decarbonization can be achieved most cost-effectively by leveraging existing and emerging technologies, including hydrogen, renewable natural gas, energy storage, small modular reactors, and geothermal energy. “Currently, natural gas is the only resource capable of meeting peak demand periods year-round. New nuclear, renewable energy, energy storage, and other assets may all be part of the solution in the future. Until then, demand growth over the next decade will require flexible assets that can be readily deployed, particularly as the economy expands and nuclear generators undergo refurbishment. “Importing hydro from other provinces is also not an option as existing transmission lines will not provide sufficient capacity and expanding that capacity will require long lead times. Further, Québec is forecasting its own supply challenges over the next decade as it uses electrification to curb emissions. “We are also deeply concerned about affordability. Replacing the more than 11,300 MW of transmission-connected gas-fired generators in Ontario by 2030 – or nearly a third of total installed supply capacity across the province – will cost in the tens of billions of dollars for businesses and residents. This will have devastating implications for ratepayers and/or taxpayers as Ontario faces post-pandemic economic recovery.” – 30 – About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

The Council leverages the businesses and organizations involved, representing hundreds of thousands of employees from across the Province, to provide support for Ontario’s historic COVID-19 vaccination effort with the ultimate goal of ending the pandemic. The Ontario Vaccination Support Council (OVSC) launched an online portal to connect Ontario’s public health units with private sector organizations offering local support. The portal will allow for two-way communication between the private sector and public local health units so that organizations can volunteer time or resources to support the province’s vaccination efforts. The portal will also serve as a resource to the general public by providing links to key public health information and resources. Click here to access the portal: www.vaccinesupportcouncil.com The Council will be meeting virtually once a week every Tuesday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. with regular email correspondence. The Council is co-chaired by James Scongack, Executive-Vice President of Corporate Affairs & Operational Services at Bruce Power and Garrick Tiplady, Managing Director of Facebook Canada. The Council brings together a diverse cross-section of OCC members to share pertinent information, inform OCC priorities, and provide government with timely and evidence-based recommendations. We understand members can engage only to their level of ability during this fast-paced and often chaotic time but, at the same time, be assured there is a central place for you to bring your ideas to the OCC. The Council will: Provide a window into Ontario’s Business Community where the Ontario Vaccine Distribution Task Force can share public health information; updates on logistics and distribution plans and seek input on non-health-related issues. Consolidate a directory of capabilities and services within the Chamber Network that could be utilized and procured by government, hospitals, and public health in the distribution of vaccinations. Share policies, best practices and approaches with government to ensure the maximum participation of employers and their employees in vaccination efforts with a specific focus on removing barriers. The longer-term focus of the Council could potentially turn to Ontario’s economic recovery.

We have also continued to ask for more notice when public health measures change. The frustration from business owners has been palpable as they try to decide whether or not to invest in the necessary health and safety supplies, rehiring, inventory and planning required to reopen their operations. “The same type of transparency needs to be applied to communications around AstraZeneca. It is still unclear when Ontarians who received a first dose will receive their second shot. “We call on the Province to help restore public and business confidence in the government’s management of the COVID-19 crisis by providing Ontarians with clarity on: Evidence-based metrics for reopening, namely thresholds related to daily case counts, capacity within our healthcare system, and how rapidly the virus is spreading. For instance, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer said he would like to see the number of new daily COVID-19 cases for Ontario “well below” 1,000 before easing public health restrictions. Will this be the threshold for reopening? When and how Ontarians who received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will receive their second dose, or at least when that decision will be made and what information it will be based on. How public health measures will adapt when the majority of Ontarians will have received their first vaccine dose. For instance, other jurisdictions like Saskatchewan have provided a clear plan and roadmap for what can open and when, accompanied by an expected timeline. “We fully appreciate the need to be nimble and agile in responding to a crisis that is evolving rapidly; however, this flexibility should not preclude the government from providing Ontarians with a clear understanding about the key metrics and thresholds for a measured, safe, and carefully calibrated reopening plan.” -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business. The OCC’s mission is to support economic growth in Ontario by defending business priorities at Queen’s Park on behalf of its network’s diverse 60,000 members.

Through this initiative, local chambers of commerce and boards of trade are rolling out free rapid tests for small- and medium-sized businesses. The program is helping small businesses keep their employees and families safe by curbing the spread of COVID-19 at work so that we can get on the path to economic recovery faster. “With vaccinations on the rise and case counts lowering, rapid testing is another critical part of curbing the spread of COVID-19, contributing to the safe reopening of our economy. As the indispensable partner of business, we are incredibly proud of the Ontario Chamber Network that has quickly mobilized to put free rapid screening kits into the hands of small businesses across Ontario,” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The COVID-19 Rapid Screening Initiative provides free rapid antigen tests for employees of small and medium-sized businesses. The tests are distributed through participating local chambers of commerce and boards of trade in Ontario. Businesses (including non-chamber members) with 150 employees or less are welcome to participate in this program. The goal of the program is to identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the workplace that might otherwise be missed, helping to curb the spread in the workplace, at home and around the community. The Initiative builds upon the success of the program that was first successfully piloted in the Waterloo region by the Greater Kitchener Waterloo and Cambridge Chambers of Commerce in partnership with Communitech, the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada. Through this pilot, the chambers have delivered 300,000 kits to almost 3,000 businesses in the region. Click here to see which chambers and boards of trade are participating in the program to date.

As the indispensable partner of business, we are incredibly proud of the Ontario Chamber Network that has quickly mobilized to put free rapid screening kits into the hands of small businesses across Ontario,” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. The COVID-19 Rapid Screening Initiative provides free rapid antigen tests for employees of small and medium-sized businesses. The tests are distributed through participating local chambers of commerce and boards of trade in Ontario. Businesses (including non-chamber members) with 150 employees or less are welcome to participate in this program. The goal of the program is to identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in the workplace that might otherwise be missed, helping to curb the spread in the workplace, at home and around the community. The Initiative builds upon the success of the program that was first successfully piloted in the Waterloo region by the Greater Kitchener Waterloo and Cambridge Chambers of Commerce in partnership with Communitech, the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada. Through this pilot, the chambers have delivered 300,000 kits to almost 3,000 businesses in the region. Click here to see which chambers and boards of trade are participating in the program to date. More chambers of commerce and boards of trade will be joining in the coming weeks. -30- About the Ontario Chamber of Commerce For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has been the independent, non-partisan, indispensable partner of Ontario business.

With nearly one-third of Ontarians fully vaccinated and our positivity rate dropping to the lowest since early Fall, we urge government to closely monitor the indicators for reopening so we can confidently move to the next stage of a safe reopening of our economy sooner than anticipated. Continued supports, such as an additional round of the Ontario Small Business Support Grant, will be critical to help keep businesses afloat. “We also need immediate public health guidance for those Ontarians who are now fully vaccinated. “The Ontario Chamber Network encourages every Ontarian to get their shot as soon as they can to help slow transmission of new variants and prevent a fourth wave.

Local governments do not have the fiscal autonomy they need to make them competitive and maintaining the status quo could be devastating for communities in a post-COVID economic recovery. The impact of the virus and the resultant public health measures have meant that most municipalities are seeing a decline in revenue and increase in expenditures. Today, as all levels of government look to balance debt and deficits while protecting the well-being of our communities, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) released its latest report, Better Budgets: Bolstering the Fiscal Resilience of Ontario’s Municipalities. This policy brief identifies 14 recommendations for both the Province and municipalities which can bring immediate and long-term relief to communities across Ontario. “Municipalities in Ontario are facing a triple threat this year: an ongoing pandemic that has been devastating to local economies, reduced revenue from closed or limited services, and increased spending on public health and human services. The Financial Accountability Office estimates the pandemic will collectively cost municipalities $2.7 billion in 2021, on top of the expected $4.1 billion impact of 2020,[i]” said Rocco Rossi, President and CEO of the OCC. “In Budget 2021, the Government of Ontario committed to a long‐term economic growth plan. It is imperative public policymakers do everything they can do to ensure our communities do not get left behind in recovery.” “Ontario’s post-pandemic recovery and long-term success will depend heavily on unleashing the economic potential of our municipalities,” said Claudia Dessanti, Senior Manager, Policy of the OCC. “Given that local governments in Ontario cannot run budget deficits, their current options for fiscal sustainability are limited to tax increases, service cuts, and the use of reserves. Now is the time for municipalities and the Province to explore alternative means of achieving fiscal sustainability.” “Ontario’s municipalities are engines of economic growth, driving entrepreneurship, innovation, and job creation,” said Stephen Beatty, Chairman, Global Cities Centre of Excellence, KPMG in Canada, which developed the KPMG City Competitiveness Index that analyzes 62 cities in 12 countries on over 300 metrics. “Municipal fiscal sustainability was a concern for Ontario businesses before the pandemic. Now, the situation is dire. Both municipalities and business are struggling to cover costs. Municipalities require much more diverse tax bases and revenue sources to provide the kind of services and infrastructure that’s needed to make communities places where people can and want to live and play.” Key recommendations outlined in the report include: Undertake a comprehensive and forward-looking review of Ontario’s property tax system to ensure the system is more equitable, efficient, and predictable for businesses. Adhere to the ‘pay-for-say principle’ to ensure that all responsibilities are accompanied by adequate funding. Enhance and incentivize regional collaboration across municipalities.

The Framework outlines five guiding principles for private sector businesses to adopt in the development of their independent proof-of-vaccination frameworks in the absence of a domestic system. “We are pleased to present a proof of vaccination framework to support organizations in their reopening plans,” said Rocco Rossi. “We have said from the beginning that we support a centralized, Canada-wide approach to COVID-19 proof-of-vaccination that could be easily used to confirm vaccination status for international and domestic use. So, in consultation with vaccine policy thought leaders at McCarthy Tétrault, we’ve innovated and advanced a common framework for our Ontario business community. In the absence of government guidance on domestic applicability, we hope these principles can avoid a piecemeal approach in the province.” Implementing proof-of-vaccination will incentivize more people to get vaccinated, allow businesses to safely reopen and mitigate against the risk of further lockdowns. Public health restrictions, such as capacity limits, could then be modified accordingly based on the lower risk involved with close contact among fully vaccinated individuals, achieving the dual purpose of safe community engagement and productive economic recovery. “We have already seen a number of businesses, organizations, associations, unions, and post-secondary institutions implement their own proof-of-vaccination policies,” add Rossi. “With this Framework, private sector businesses can implement similar programs with shared confidence.” The Vax-Pass Tenets provide businesses with five principles to consider: Safety: Businesses must take all steps reasonable in the circumstances to protect the health and safety of their workforce and place of business. Science: Vax-pass programs should be consistent with current science and public health recommendations on COVID-19. Accommodation: Businesses must provide human rights-related accommodation to the point of undue hardship. Privacy: Businesses should use the least intrusive mechanism to verify vaccination status.

The Framework outlines five guiding principles for private sector businesses to adopt in the development of their independent proof-of-vaccination frameworks in the absence of a domestic system. “We are pleased to present a proof of vaccination framework to support organizations in their reopening plans,” said Rocco Rossi. “We have said from the beginning that we support a centralized, Canada-wide approach to COVID-19 proof-of-vaccination that could be easily used to confirm vaccination status for international and domestic use. So, in consultation with vaccine policy thought leaders at McCarthy Tétrault, we’ve innovated and advanced a common framework for our Ontario business community. In the absence of government guidance on domestic applicability, we hope these principles can avoid a piecemeal approach in the province.” Implementing proof-of-vaccination will incentivize more people to get vaccinated, allow businesses to safely reopen and mitigate against the risk of further lockdowns. Public health restrictions, such as capacity limits, could then be modified accordingly based on the lower risk involved with close contact among fully vaccinated individuals, achieving the dual purpose of safe community engagement and productive economic recovery. “We have already seen a number of businesses, organizations, associations, unions, and post-secondary institutions implement their own proof-of-vaccination policies,” add Rossi. “With this Framework, private sector businesses can implement similar programs with shared confidence.” The Vax-Pass Tenets provide businesses with five principles to consider: Safety: Businesses must take all steps reasonable in the circumstances to protect the health and safety of their workforce and place of business. Science: Vax-pass programs should be consistent with current science and public health recommendations on COVID-19. Accommodation: Businesses must provide human rights-related accommodation to the point of undue hardship. Privacy: Businesses should use the least intrusive mechanism to verify vaccination status. Transparency: Businesses should engage in clear and ongoing dialogue with employees and customers to manage understanding and expectations and educate stakeholders about the importance of COVID-19 vaccination. The Ontario Chamber Network will continue to advocate for a safe economic and societal recovery. Read the Vax-Pass Tenets. This document is not human resources advice or legal advice.
