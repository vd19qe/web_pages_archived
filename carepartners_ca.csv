And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. How we are keeping patients and families safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to every visit, whether the visit is at a clinic, retirement home or in a patient’s home. PPE includes masks and goggles and may also include a gown and gloves. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate and to test negative for COVID-19 before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are eliminating meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. We need your help – PPE donations To help us continue caring for thousands of patients across Ontario every day, we are asking for our community partners to donate PPE supplies. We are in urgent need of large quantities of: surgical masks, gowns, gloves, goggles and hand sanitizer. For more information, and drop-off locations near you, please call Megan at 226-972-7313. Thank you for your contribution to the continued safety of patients throughout the province. We’re all in this together. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Will my services change because of the COVID-19 pandemic? Some Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) have started to defer services for lower needs patients, which may impact your care. CarePartners is contracted through the LHIN to provide home and community-based services to people across Ontario. The LHIN will contact you if they need to make changes to your care plan. If you have questions about these changes or your care plan, you should contact your local LHIN care coordinator. To help us continue to provide quality care to those who rely on it to remain safe at home, we have identified ways to limit in-person contact, where safe to do so, using virtual care technology. Some services are now being conducted using video and teleconferencing through our CarePartners Connect app. In other cases, we are making phone calls to check in on patients and complete consultations. If you are receiving nursing or therapy services from CarePartners, you may be eligible for virtual care. One change you will notice though is that CarePartners staff will show up to all visits wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This includes visits in retirement homes, clinics and patients’ homes. Your care provider may ask you to dispose of a gown after the visit; to help them, please place a waste basket lined with a plastic bag near the door of a washroom. Your provider will be washing their hands after your services have been performed, and disposing of their gown before they leave your house. The garbage bag with the PPE (gown) can be thrown out the same way you would other garbage; just put the discarded equipment in one plastic bag, tie it off, and then put that plastic bag in a larger garbage bag. Will my visits be cancelled? In the unlikely event that CarePartners must cancel your visit, we will promptly contact you by phone to let you know. We will work with your schedule to ensure that care is provided to you as quickly as possible. This is no different than our process before the pandemic occurred. We also understand that due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our patients may wish to cancel or postpone their visits. We respect your right to make these decisions and will work with you to make this process straightforward. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough or shortness of breath, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself or my loved ones? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home, unless you are an essential worker. Only go out if it is necessary (e.g. to retrieve groceries). Stay home if you are over 70 years of age. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs. Implementing video and teleconferencing technologies to deliver care virtually, helping to limit in-person contact. Read about our virtual care options below. Virtual care options The pandemic has forced health care providers to think about new ways to deliver patient care, considering ways to limit in-person contact, where safe to do so. Through our CarePartners Connect app, we are able to continue providing secure, quality care to patients who need it – in the safest way possible. Virtual care means providing health care services and resources to patients, without seeing them in person. Virtual care services are delivered through mobile devices, such as cell phones, tablets and computers. Virtual care services may include: Videoconferencing consults or assessments Sharing educational resources Updating, viewing, tracking records Instant messaging Scheduling appointments Benefits of virtual care: Eliminates travel time to and between appointments for patients and providers. Reduces need to leave home for appointments for patients or caregivers who have mobility issues. Enables caregivers to participate in loved ones’ care planning, no matter where they live. Gives patients more control in managing care and scheduling services. If you are interested in learning more about CarePartners Connect and our virtual service options, please contact your local CarePartners branch.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs. Implementing video and teleconferencing technologies to deliver care virtually, helping to limit in-person contact. Read about our virtual care options below. Virtual care options The pandemic has forced health care providers to think about new ways to deliver patient care, considering ways to limit in-person contact, where safe to do so.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home.

We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way.

PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19.

Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs. Implementing video and teleconferencing technologies to deliver care virtually, helping to limit in-person contact. Read about our virtual care options below. Virtual care options The pandemic has forced health care providers to think about new ways to deliver patient care, considering ways to limit in-person contact, where safe to do so. Through our CarePartners Connect app, we are able to continue providing secure, quality care to patients who need it – in the safest way possible. Virtual care means providing health care services and resources to patients, without seeing them in person. Virtual care services are delivered through mobile devices, such as cell phones, tablets and computers. Virtual care services may include: Videoconferencing consults or assessments Sharing educational resources Updating, viewing, tracking records Instant messaging Scheduling appointments Benefits of virtual care: Eliminates travel time to and between appointments for patients and providers. Reduces need to leave home for appointments for patients or caregivers who have mobility issues. Enables caregivers to participate in loved ones’ care planning, no matter where they live. Gives patients more control in managing care and scheduling services. If you are interested in learning more about CarePartners Connect and our virtual service options, please contact your local CarePartners branch.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

And now is no different. CarePartners continues to provide patients with safe and reliable home and community care services now and in the future, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority.

We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health.

And now is no different. CarePartners is working hard to provide you with safe and reliable home and community care services during these trying times, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, their family and our staff. We are committed to continuing to provide you with the quality care you need to remain safe at home. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. Thank you for your trust, support and understanding. We will continue to actively monitor the situation with COVID-19 as it unfolds to keep you informed on how it may impact our services. What we are doing to keep patients safe Since the COVID-19 virus began affecting communities in January 2020, CarePartners has worked vigilantly to plan and prepare for how to manage this issue, in partnership with government officials and other health service agencies. We have a dedicated team of experts who work, every day, to update our Pandemic Response Plan, so we remain prepared to continue delivering services to patients and families, in a safe and sustainable way. Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19.

Here are key components of our Pandemic Response Plan that serve to keep you safe: During the scheduling process, or in advance of visits, we are calling patients to confirm whether they, or anyone in their household, have symptoms associated with COVID-19. All staff have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with them at home or clinic visits to use if they detect a patient or family member with a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to the COVID-19 virus. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and goggles. We are closely monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among our staff. Staff who have recently travelled must report the travel to their manager and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not. Staff who have a confirmed diagnosis or believe they may have been to exposed to the virus, even if symptoms are not present, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to test negative for COVID-19 twice before returning to work. Appropriate follow ups with potentially affected staff or patients will be made in the case a staff member tests positive for COVID-19. We are enhancing the cleaning of our offices by making sure that all high-touch surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. We are reducing the number of meetings where groups of people gather face-to-face, and instead using virtual meetings. How do I report suspected exposure to COVID-19? We appreciate your efforts to help us control the spread of COVID-19 to other patients and our staff. If you or someone in your household has a fever, new or worsening cough, or suspected/known contact with someone exposed to COVID-19, you should call your CarePartners Scheduling Coordinator to alert us to your symptoms. We will assess to determine how best to proceed with your scheduled care. In addition, you must call your local public health unit, your primary care provider (for example, family doctor) or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000. You will be instructed on next steps, which may or may not include screening. How can I protect myself? Clean your hands often. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use sanitizer when washing is not accessible. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Practice social distancing (six feet of distance between people). Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain physical distance in public spaces. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or in the crook of your arm; and throw away used tissue. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to clean frequently touched surfaces.

That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs. Implementing video and teleconferencing technologies to deliver care virtually, helping to limit in-person contact. Read about our virtual care options below.

We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health.

And now is no different. CarePartners continues to provide patients with safe and reliable home and community care services now and in the future, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs.

And now is no different. CarePartners continues to provide patients with safe and reliable home and community care services now and in the future, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health.

And now is no different. CarePartners continues to provide patients with safe and reliable home and community care services now and in the future, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made changes to our practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization, Government of Canada, and federal and provincial health authorities. As Ontario Government moves ahead with its provincial Reopening Plan, CarePartners continues to adhere to strict safety protocols when delivering care in order to keep our patients and staff safe. That is our top priority. What you can expect during a visit from us CarePartners continues to follow – often exceeding – Public Health guidelines when it comes to how we are delivering care to patients during and after the pandemic. We are screening all patients and household members for COVID-19 symptoms before each visit. This is done over the phone. If symptoms are present, we adjust our care delivery plan accordingly, aligned to Public Health guidelines. Staff wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during every visit, whether it’s in a clinic, retirement home or a patient’s home. PPE works to protect both the provider and the patient. Masks are discarded after each patient interaction in the community setting. If a patient or household member has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 symptoms, a mask, goggles, gown and gloves are worn, whether in a clinic, retirement home or patient’s home. This PPE is immediately discarded at the end of the visit. Enhanced safety measures across the company Besides the careful, consistent processes we have put in place to ensure the safety of patients and staff during visits, we have made additional improvements to how we operate, including: Monitoring and tracking all potential exposure risks among patients and our staff, including mandatory self-isolation for staff returning from international travel, confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and suspected COVID-19 exposure. Enhancing office cleaning, practicing social/physical distancing between work spaces and reducing in-person meetings. Educating staff on the most up-to-date guidelines and resources from Public Health and Ontario Health. Securing a sustainable supply of PPE for our staff; they have continued access to all the PPE they need to do safely do their jobs.
