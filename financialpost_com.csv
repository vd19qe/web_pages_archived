Trudeau’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, will provide a fiscal update Wednesday that’s expected to show a current-year deficit of at least $250 billion, or 12 per cent of economic output. The gap last year was about 1 per cent of gross domestic product. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Massive deficit to be revealed today begins new era of debt for Canada Back to video The Globe and Mail newspaper reported late Tuesday the figure will exceed $300 billion. No other major advanced economy tracked by the International Monetary Fund is expected to record a larger one-year fiscal swing in 2020. While the massive shortfall has broad political support, it’s dramatic departure for a country with a longstanding aversion to debt and leaves Canada with the prospect of running large deficits for years to come. Morneau, the first finance minister to oversee a credit rating downgrade in 25 years, is under pressure to provide at least cursory assurances the government will return to a more fiscally prudent path once the coronavirus crisis has passed.

Article content continued The question is “what the next one, two, three years are going to look like and what the appetite is going to be to pull that deficit back down,” Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone, adding it may be too early for the government to give much guidance. Debt Management It’s unclear whether Morneau will provide forecasts beyond the current fiscal year. The figures will be released around 1:40 p.m. in Ottawa, when the finance minister is due to deliver the “economic and fiscal snapshot” in parliament. He’s expected to announce some details around plans to extend debt duration to lock in historically low interest rates, one senior government official told Bloomberg, on condition they not be identified.

Article content continued More On This Topic Just a month or two more of this recession and it truly will be the Big One Business leaders urge Ottawa, provinces to work together to ‘open up Canada’ Fitch strips Canada of AAA rating as finances deteriorate Trudeau’s government has already budgeted direct COVID-19 spending of $174 billion, almost half to finance a $2,000 a month payment to those who’ve lost jobs or income as a result of the economic crisis. More than 8 million people have received at least one payment under the so-called Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Before the crisis, Morneau had projected a budget gap of $28 billion. Adding in lower tax revenue and other emergency spending brings the total shortfall to near the quarter-trillion dollar mark. There’s a risk it could blow out even wider if the current programs are extended. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The sudden gaping hole in the government’s balance sheet has already prompted Fitch Ratings to downgrade Canada’s AAA debt assessment, a blow to a country that took pride in its top status. The last downgrade in 1995, when Moody’s Investors Service Inc. cut to Aa2 from Aa1, and launched the Liberal government of the day on a years-long campaign back to balance. A deficit-fighting mindset remained in place for years, until Trudeau rode an anti-austerity platform to power in 2015 and again last year. Even then, his deficits were modest, hovering at less than 1 per cent of GDP. Road Ahead The Canadian leader, ironically, will probably spend the rest of his political career reining in government spending. The trick will be to phase out COVID-19 programs without creating a shock to the economy. Morneau’s fiscal snapshot may provide details on how the government plans to proceed.

Article content continued Possibilities include retaining the income-support program longer, or pushing individuals onto employment insurance. Another outstanding issue is how the government plans to expand eligibility for wage subsidies, allowing more companies and organizations to qualify. Trudeau, whose party lacks a majority in parliament, is facing pressure from his left to prolong government aid. “We’re not out of this pandemic yet. Canadians – and our economy – need the supports to continue,” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, said in an email. On Trudeau’s right, questions are growing about the effectiveness of some of the spending, along with calls for more transparency and the need to get Canadians back to work. “Some of this spending is starting to look a bit indiscriminate,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told Bloomberg News in an interview last week. “And I really think we need to be careful not to disincentivize people from going back to work.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Fast Cash But few outside politics blame Trudeau for the large deficits. The quick release of massive amounts of cash directly to Canadians has largely been lauded by economists, who claim the situation would have been much worse without it. Another saving grace is that Canada has plenty of fiscal capacity, with pre-pandemic debt to GDP at around 30 per cent, the lowest ratio in the Group of Seven. Borrowing costs are also at all-time lows, which should keep a lid on public debt charges. The IMF is forecasting a 6.2 per cent economic contraction for all of 2020, followed by 4.2 per cent expansion in 2021. That would be in the middle of the pack of advanced economies. Yet, future waves of COVID-19 will probably erode Canada’s fiscal capacity further. As the Fitch downgrade illustrates, there are limits to how high the nation’s debt can rise without a backlash.

Canadian housing showing strength, but not all markets are firing equally Back to video Residential sales across Canada increased by 26 per cent in July over June, and 30.5 per cent higher than in July 2019. But as sales accelerated, indicating a higher-than-usual demand, the supply side lagged, with month-over-month new listings increasing by just 7.6 per cent. The mismatch between demand and supply, with sales outpacing new listings, exerted pricing pressure such that the average housing price in Canada increased by 14.3 per cent in July from the same month a year ago.

Article content continued More On This Topic CMHC CEO’s letter ruffles feathers as bankers say stricter mortgage rules could dash first-time homebuyers’ hopes ‘The system is broken’: Pandemic exacerbates landlord-tenant power struggle with both sides crying foul Pent-up demand drove housing sales in July and there may be more to come CMHC says its share of mortgage market has shrunk to dangerous levels because of tougher rules Canada’s three largest housing markets led the charge, mostly as a result of the pent-up demand from forgone sales in March and April. Seasonally adjusted July sales were up by 49.5 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area, 43.9 per cent in Greater Vancouver and 39.1 per cent in Montreal over the previous month. Sales volume was higher in July in the Prairies relative to last year, but the pace of growth was much slower than the more populous cities. Seasonally adjusted July sales were up by 15.7 per cent in Calgary, 9.7 per cent in Edmonton, 8.2 per cent in Regina and 5.6 per cent in Saskatoon over the previous month. The slower growth in housing sales in the Prairies masks the broader economic struggles in Alberta and Saskatchewan resulting from the decline in crude prices. A comparative analysis of indexed benchmark prices, which allows for a comparison of structurally similar dwellings, shows that prices over the past five years in large markets were up except in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Benchmarked prices in July were down 10.2 per cent in Calgary, nine per cent in Edmonton, 9.6 per cent in Regina, and 8.3 per cent in Saskatoon over five years. By comparison, prices were up 55 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area, 47 per cent in Greater Vancouver and 34 per cent in the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Another sign of trouble was recently revealed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC), which reported higher mortgage deferral rates in resource-extraction economies. Deferral rates were 21 per cent in Alberta, and 14.8 per cent in both Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, compared to 10.1 per cent in Ontario and 5.6 per cent in Quebec. The largest price increases over five years were recorded in smaller towns within the commuter shed of more populous markets. For example, benchmarked five-year prices in July increased by 88.5 per cent in the Niagara Region and 66 per cent in the Hamilton-Burlington area near Toronto. Similarly, prices were up by 75 per cent in Fraser Valley near Greater Vancouver. The accelerated price increases in the satellite towns near large urban centres suggest that smaller towns are narrowing the price gap with their larger neighbours. Consider that prices in the Greater Toronto Area five years ago were 226 per cent higher than those in the Niagara Region, but that gap was reduced to 186 per cent in July. Affordable small towns within the commuter shed of larger, more expensive towns might experience greater demand during COVID-19 as homebuyers have expressed renewed interest in larger dwellings, which are more affordable in the remote suburbs. A home for sale in Montreal. Photo by Christinne Muschi/Bloomberg Housing markets in Montreal and further east are also showing strength, with sales and prices mostly higher over the past 12 months. The Quebec City CMA, the second-largest market in Quebec, reported a 43 per cent increase in July sales from five years ago. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Surprisingly, benchmarked prices were up by just 4.4 per cent over the same period. A strong post-pandemic economic recovery might push prices higher in places such as Quebec City that have not experienced a large increase in prices over the past five years. Housing markets are being held together by mortgage forbearance and income support measures implemented by lenders and governments to limit COVID-19’s adverse impact on the economy and consumption.The preliminary numbers for August sales and prices hint at the continuation of increasing sales and rising prices, at least partly supported by income support measures, which might be extended into 2021. At the same time, recent gains in employment suggest an economic recovery, as do reports suggesting that mortgage deferrals are in decline — some borrowers apparently opted to defer as an early precautionary measure — even thoughCMHC is reporting that almost 14 per cent of the mortgages are in deferral. The housing market outlook depends upon the pace of any economic recovery and the extension of income support and deferral programs. Much is not known with certainty. Hence, it will be prudent for homebuyers to respond to uncertainty with caution and restraint than exuberance. Murtaza Haider is a professor of Real Estate Management at Ryerson University.

They’re back … Perennial worries of Canadians before the pandemic, household debt and its worst outcome insolvency, appear to be on the rise again after a hiatus during COVID-19’s initial shock. Data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Wednesday showed that after plummeting 38.8% in April and 8.8% in May, consumer insolvencies have begun to creep up again. Insolvencies climbed 3.7% in July from the month before after a 3.9% increase in June, potentially signaling the beginning of an upward trend, says the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals. “Prior to the widespread income shock and economic uncertainty brought on by COVID, consumer insolvencies were on the rise in Canada. The latest stats may point to a return to that trend,” said CAIRP chair Mark Rosen. Consumer insolvencies for the 12 months ending July are still down 10.6% from last year as COVID income aid programs keep many households afloat. But pressure is again ramping up. With the Canada Emergency Response Benefit ending soon, many people will be moving to employment insurance, which for some will pay less. “There is a large proportion of Canadians who are already technically insolvent; they are unable to pay their bills and debt repayment obligations each month. Most who are in this position are using COVID-related financial support to make ends meet. But we know that many of these individuals will need debt relief when the temporary support ends,” said CAIRP executive board member André Bolduc. The Atlantic provinces are already showing that stress with the largest consumer insolvency increases in the country. In July, insolvencies in PEI spiked 41.7% from the month before. In Newfoundland and Labrador they were up 18.1%, Nova Scotia, 11.2% and New Brunswick 6.8%. But it was a trend seen across most of Canada. Insolvencies were up 4.7% in Quebec and British Columbia, 4.5% in Ontario and 1.7% in Alberta. The only provinces to buck the trend were Manitoba where insolvencies fell 20.7% and Saskatchewan which saw a 8.6% drop. “At this point, it is impossible to understand exactly how much the pandemic will impact the number of insolvency filings, but all signs point to a tough road ahead particularly as financial support decreases or runs out entirely,” said Rosen. Meanwhile, our debt is rising. A report by Equifax Canada today showed that consumer debt was up 2.8% in the second quarter from the year before, reaching $1.9 trillion. Rising mortgage debt was the biggest driver as record low rates spurred Canadians to keep buying houses in the pandemic. Others are taking longer to pay off their mortgages because of deferred payments. Equifax says about three million Canadians have taken some sort of COVID-related payment holiday since February, though deferrals have been dropping in recent weeks. In the 35 to 44-year-old age group 15.1% took a payment deferral; among seniors it was 5.7%. Non-mortgage debt — credit cards, auto loans and lines of credit — though still down from last year because of the COVID lockdown, is showing “the greenshoots of a bounceback with credit card spending starting to rise in June,” said Rebecca Oakes of Equifax. “Card spending for those not using a payment deferral on their credit card were effectively back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter,” she said. _____________________________________________ Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Canadian housing showing strength, but not all markets are firing equally Back to video Residential sales across Canada increased by 26 per cent in July over June, and 30.5 per cent higher than in July 2019. But as sales accelerated, indicating a higher-than-usual demand, the supply side lagged, with month-over-month new listings increasing by just 7.6 per cent. The mismatch between demand and supply, with sales outpacing new listings, exerted pricing pressure such that the average housing price in Canada increased by 14.3 per cent in July from the same month a year ago.

Article content continued More On This Topic CMHC CEO’s letter ruffles feathers as bankers say stricter mortgage rules could dash first-time homebuyers’ hopes ‘The system is broken’: Pandemic exacerbates landlord-tenant power struggle with both sides crying foul Pent-up demand drove housing sales in July and there may be more to come CMHC says its share of mortgage market has shrunk to dangerous levels because of tougher rules Canada’s three largest housing markets led the charge, mostly as a result of the pent-up demand from forgone sales in March and April. Seasonally adjusted July sales were up by 49.5 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area, 43.9 per cent in Greater Vancouver and 39.1 per cent in Montreal over the previous month. Sales volume was higher in July in the Prairies relative to last year, but the pace of growth was much slower than the more populous cities. Seasonally adjusted July sales were up by 15.7 per cent in Calgary, 9.7 per cent in Edmonton, 8.2 per cent in Regina and 5.6 per cent in Saskatoon over the previous month. The slower growth in housing sales in the Prairies masks the broader economic struggles in Alberta and Saskatchewan resulting from the decline in crude prices. A comparative analysis of indexed benchmark prices, which allows for a comparison of structurally similar dwellings, shows that prices over the past five years in large markets were up except in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Benchmarked prices in July were down 10.2 per cent in Calgary, nine per cent in Edmonton, 9.6 per cent in Regina, and 8.3 per cent in Saskatoon over five years. By comparison, prices were up 55 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area, 47 per cent in Greater Vancouver and 34 per cent in the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area (CMA).

Article content continued Another sign of trouble was recently revealed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC), which reported higher mortgage deferral rates in resource-extraction economies. Deferral rates were 21 per cent in Alberta, and 14.8 per cent in both Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, compared to 10.1 per cent in Ontario and 5.6 per cent in Quebec. The largest price increases over five years were recorded in smaller towns within the commuter shed of more populous markets. For example, benchmarked five-year prices in July increased by 88.5 per cent in the Niagara Region and 66 per cent in the Hamilton-Burlington area near Toronto. Similarly, prices were up by 75 per cent in Fraser Valley near Greater Vancouver. The accelerated price increases in the satellite towns near large urban centres suggest that smaller towns are narrowing the price gap with their larger neighbours. Consider that prices in the Greater Toronto Area five years ago were 226 per cent higher than those in the Niagara Region, but that gap was reduced to 186 per cent in July. Affordable small towns within the commuter shed of larger, more expensive towns might experience greater demand during COVID-19 as homebuyers have expressed renewed interest in larger dwellings, which are more affordable in the remote suburbs.

The Quebec City CMA, the second-largest market in Quebec, reported a 43 per cent increase in July sales from five years ago. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Surprisingly, benchmarked prices were up by just 4.4 per cent over the same period. A strong post-pandemic economic recovery might push prices higher in places such as Quebec City that have not experienced a large increase in prices over the past five years. Housing markets are being held together by mortgage forbearance and income support measures implemented by lenders and governments to limit COVID-19’s adverse impact on the economy and consumption.The preliminary numbers for August sales and prices hint at the continuation of increasing sales and rising prices, at least partly supported by income support measures, which might be extended into 2021. At the same time, recent gains in employment suggest an economic recovery, as do reports suggesting that mortgage deferrals are in decline — some borrowers apparently opted to defer as an early precautionary measure — even thoughCMHC is reporting that almost 14 per cent of the mortgages are in deferral. The housing market outlook depends upon the pace of any economic recovery and the extension of income support and deferral programs. Much is not known with certainty. Hence, it will be prudent for homebuyers to respond to uncertainty with caution and restraint than exuberance. Murtaza Haider is a professor of Real Estate Management at Ryerson University.

They’re back … Perennial worries of Canadians before the pandemic, household debt and its worst outcome insolvency, appear to be on the rise again after a hiatus during COVID-19’s initial shock. Data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Wednesday showed that after plummeting 38.8% in April and 8.8% in May, consumer insolvencies have begun to creep up again. Insolvencies climbed 3.7% in July from the month before after a 3.9% increase in June, potentially signaling the beginning of an upward trend, says the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals. “Prior to the widespread income shock and economic uncertainty brought on by COVID, consumer insolvencies were on the rise in Canada. The latest stats may point to a return to that trend,” said CAIRP chair Mark Rosen. Consumer insolvencies for the 12 months ending July are still down 10.6% from last year as COVID income aid programs keep many households afloat. But pressure is again ramping up. With the Canada Emergency Response Benefit ending soon, many people will be moving to employment insurance, which for some will pay less. “There is a large proportion of Canadians who are already technically insolvent; they are unable to pay their bills and debt repayment obligations each month. Most who are in this position are using COVID-related financial support to make ends meet. But we know that many of these individuals will need debt relief when the temporary support ends,” said CAIRP executive board member André Bolduc. The Atlantic provinces are already showing that stress with the largest consumer insolvency increases in the country. In July, insolvencies in PEI spiked 41.7% from the month before. In Newfoundland and Labrador they were up 18.1%, Nova Scotia, 11.2% and New Brunswick 6.8%. But it was a trend seen across most of Canada. Insolvencies were up 4.7% in Quebec and British Columbia, 4.5% in Ontario and 1.7% in Alberta. The only provinces to buck the trend were Manitoba where insolvencies fell 20.7% and Saskatchewan which saw a 8.6% drop. “At this point, it is impossible to understand exactly how much the pandemic will impact the number of insolvency filings, but all signs point to a tough road ahead particularly as financial support decreases or runs out entirely,” said Rosen. Meanwhile, our debt is rising. A report by Equifax Canada today showed that consumer debt was up 2.8% in the second quarter from the year before, reaching $1.9 trillion. Rising mortgage debt was the biggest driver as record low rates spurred Canadians to keep buying houses in the pandemic. Others are taking longer to pay off their mortgages because of deferred payments. Equifax says about three million Canadians have taken some sort of COVID-related payment holiday since February, though deferrals have been dropping in recent weeks. In the 35 to 44-year-old age group 15.1% took a payment deferral; among seniors it was 5.7%. Non-mortgage debt — credit cards, auto loans and lines of credit — though still down from last year because of the COVID lockdown, is showing “the greenshoots of a bounceback with credit card spending starting to rise in June,” said Rebecca Oakes of Equifax. “Card spending for those not using a payment deferral on their credit card were effectively back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter,” she said. _____________________________________________ Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

In a new series, the Financial Post explores the opportunities and unknown costs of the Great Rethink. During a week in August when the United States was recording around 50,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day, President Donald Trump interrupted the macabre realities of life during the pandemic to stage a press conference about another threat to national security: Canada’s aluminum sector. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. The Great Rethink: If Canada wants to stay a trading nation it needs to up its game Back to video Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister, called the suggestion “absurd.” The American and Canadian metal industries are so integrated that a single aluminum part may regularly cross the border multiple times before being put into a car, building materials or some other product. Nevertheless, Trump announced he was imposing a 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian aluminum imports for the second time since 2017. The White House charged that Canada’s aluminum producers had flooded the market with P1020, a basic, tradable form of the metal. Trump said imposing tariffs would lift aluminum prices and keep jobs in the U.S. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued When you’re a neighbour to the U.S. market, you stick to the U.S. market. The constant harassment invites a rational response: go elsewhere. But that’s not happening because of what economists describe as the gravitational pull of the U.S. market — located next door, with a familiar culture, language and legal system, even with tariffs in place, it’s simply too big, too lucrative and too convenient for Canadian entrepreneurs to bypass. “You don’t switch markets in 24 hours, two years or something like that,” said Jean Simard, chief executive of the Aluminum Association of Canada. “When you’re a neighbour to the U.S. market, you stick to the U.S. market.” The aluminum sector’s predicament is symbolic of the trade quandary that Canada faces writ large. Protectionism is on the rise everywhere, and even the U.S., with which Canada signed a landmark trade agreement in the late 1980s, is becoming less and less reliable. More On This Topic Why the world’s resource king is so interested in Saskatchewan — podcast New data casts doubt on Trump's basis for tariffs on Canadian aluminum The Great Rethink: It's time to reassess how our provinces manage natural resource wealth Aluminum imports were attacked just weeks after a new trade agreement called the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) took effect, which was supposed to promote hassle-free commerce. Instead, at least one early analysis suggests the new agreement will actually diminish trade on the continent. Canada, which sees itself as a “trading nation,” finds itself in the untenable position of being at the mercy of U.S. attitudes about imports.

Article content continued “Some other foreign markets are growing more quickly than the U.S., but it’s highly unlikely that any of those markets are going to supplant the U.S. in dominance,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets. Donald Trump announced in August he was imposing a 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian aluminum imports for the second time since 2017. Photo by Alex Kraus/Bloomberg Experts say Canada’s approach to trade in the future will have to be a mix of learning to deal with a more protectionist U.S., while finding new opportunities on the margin. Trump’s focus has been steel and aluminum, but that could easily expand to other sectors, and indeed may already touch other sectors. Simard, the head of the Canadian aluminum lobby, said that any changes in aluminum exports to the U.S. were the result of COVID-19 lockdowns. As the economy gradually returns to prior conditions, trade is getting back to normal, he said. But Trump’s tariffs will continue to disrupt the North American manufacturing industry. Bernard Wolf, a professor of economics at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto, said the automotive industries in both countries were already in decline, as production has moved to jurisdictions with cheaper labour. “I think we’re losing it, but it’s been a slow burn kind of thing,” he said. “Protectionism would certainly accelerate it.” Canada is looking at diminishing economic prospects for the next decade because of CUSMA Dan Ciuriak, an economist and senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, said Canada is looking at diminishing economic prospects for the next decade because of CUSMA. In a paper published this summer by the C.D. Howe Institute, Ciuriak found that the agreement would reduce annual gross domestic product in the U.S. by 0.12 per cent, in Canada by 0.4 per cent and in Mexico by 0.79 per cent. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued By contrast, analysts for Global Affairs Canada found the trade agreement would increase annual GDP in Canada by 0.249 per cent. But its analysis assumed the original North American Free Trade Agreement would be nullified and Canada’s trade relationship would instead be governed by a series of tariffs. Under those assumptions, Ciuriak reaches a similar conclusion. But in comparison to NAFTA, he reckons the new framework, with its insistence on “reciprocal trade,” essentially the idea that each country should have balanced trade with the other, more strict rules of origin, and other non-tariff barriers will reduce the efficiency of the overall North American market. “If you look at the next 10 years, Canada is looking at diminished prospects,” Ciuriak said. A spokesperson for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland referred all questions to the office of Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade. Eleanore Catenaro, director of communications for Ng’s Office, said CUSMA “puts behind years of economic uncertainty” and ensures privileged access to the U.S. market. But she added that her office is also focused on trade diversification to ensure “Canadian businesses and exporter can access new opportunities in key diverse markets around the world, such as across Europe and Asia-Pacific.” Already, Ciuriak believes the tariffs are discouraging international investment in Canada because it no longer can be viewed as a location from which to safely ship to the U.S. market. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued That suggests Canadian leaders will have to reconsider their approach to attracting international investors, now that Canada’s major selling point has been neutralized. Somewhat counterintuitively, Ciuriak thinks Canada could benefit by becoming more discerning. He said not all foreign investment in Canada is beneficial, and the governments should apply new, more restrictive tests to foreign technology companies opening research offices in Canada. In the past few years, technology has been a major growth area for Canada. For example, Toronto came third in commercial real estate firm CBRE’s 2019 ranking of North American tech centres behind San Francisco and Seattle. The MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, one of the world’s largest urban innovation hubs. Photo by Postmedia There’s a debate about whether allowing a giant tech company, such as Alphabet Inc. or Microsoft Corp., or a large pharmaceutical company, to open an office in Canada is smart. Ciuriak said he believes it’s problematic because those companies harness talented workers here to create intellectual property — say, algorithms or patents — but any revenue derived from that work flows back to the company’s foreign headquarters. “If all of the intangible asset outflow is out of the country, then that’s a bad deal for Canada,” he said, adding that the review strategy for foreign investment and acquisitions of domestic companies needs modification to recognize the value of intangible assets such as intellectual property. “It’s not protectionist because we’re not stopping the company from coming; we’re saying if there’s a net loss for Canada from that investment, then we want to stop that investment from happening because we’re going to lose,” Ciuriak said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued But it’s an issue that divides experts. Daniel Schwanen, an economist at C.D. Howe, said he’s skeptical that restricting foreign technology companies from investing would help the economy. “It’s not like the talent is going to be here and waiting to be employed for cheap,” he said. “If they can’t be employed here, then they might move elsewhere. ” But he agrees that Canada is “unique in terms of having so much brain power, and the big export of the actual research, and yet has a big deficit in what it earns from that actual IP.” Rather than new restrictions, Schwanen said the best way to counter that problem could be to encourage Canadians to be more entrepreneurial. He cited the federal government’s $950-billion investment in five innovation “superclusters” as a positive development. While the pandemic drags on, and the economy stutters forward, there may indeed be opportunities for Canada’s government leaders to rethink what opportunities exist for a trade reset. It’s also possible that Ottawa will wait until after the pandemic, or at least after the November presidential election, to make any bold moves on trade strategy. Still, whether at home or abroad, there is a building consensus that the country’s trade prospects are languishing and need to be revitalized somehow. The U.S. is unlikely to recede as Canada’s dominant trading partner, but economists say there is room for change around the margins of this country’s trade strategy, whether that’s changing the strategic review of foreign investment or more government programs to help Canadians export their products into new markets. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued A strategy reset may not even be necessary, said Eric Miller, a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute who advises companies on trade. He believes the Canadian government just needs to be more involved in promoting homegrown businesses abroad. “My analogy is how do you get old people to travel abroad?” Miller said. “Well, that’s why you have those tours, and you have a tour guide who speaks English and drives the bus. They show up, get handed their hotel room keys and that’s that.” All the best trading nations, he said, from Japan to Germany to Korea, allow their governments to play a more robust role in business, whether that means bidding on actual projects then doling out the work to domestic companies or just schmoozing more with decision-makers. “The core takeaway is, if you want to become a great trading nation, let’s look at what other great trading nations do,” Miller said. • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz Share this article in your social network Share via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Open more share options Close Share this Story: The Great Rethink: If Canada wants to stay a trading nation it needs to up its game Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

In a new series, the Financial Post explores the opportunities and unknown costs of the Great Rethink. John Hartwick calls the economics rule that bears his name “boring,” even though it’s been embraced by governments in places such as Norway, Chile, Kuwait and Botswana.

The Great Rethink: It's time to reassess how our provinces manage natural resource wealth Back to video “There are a bunch of mathematical equations that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. That’s why economists consider it exciting,” said the emeritus professor of economics at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont. The Hartwick Rule, published in 1977 in the American Economic Review with an assist from famed post-war economist Robert Solow, states that exhaustible natural resources such as oil should be replaced with a substitute asset when they are extracted or else a jurisdiction will erode its total net worth.

As a result, it will confront whatever comes in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic with a US$1-trillion sovereign wealth fund. But Gulf states such as Kuwait have hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves from oil wealth, effectively turning a physical asset into a financial asset.

The Great Rethink: Why Canada’s three-decade-old approach to economic management needs an overhaul ‘Hypocritical’: After divesting from oilsands companies, Norway expands to untouched Arctic Why Norway fund’s divestment from the oilsands could trigger a bigger fund exodus Developing countries like Botswana and Chile, too, have established funds from diamond and copper mining. Even sub-national governments, including Alaska and New Mexico, have seen fit to turn the proceeds from resource extraction and the sale of state land into portfolios that offer the prospect of continuous returns. But in Hartwick’s home country, the rule has largely been ignored. “People don’t invite me to the Rotary Club to talk about this stuff,” he said. That could soon change. The coronavirus pandemic has blown holes in provincial budgets across the country, hitting provinces with large natural resource industries particularly hard. But Canada, blessed with both a sophisticated financial industry and vast supplies of natural resources, will have to finance the recovery phase of the COVID-19 crisis largely out of pocket, because a generation of decision-makers opted to maximize resource wealth in the present, rather than save it for future use.

Christiansen/Bloomberg files There’s a palpable sense of regret as finance ministers overhaul their budgets and reckon with credit downgrades, so it may be time to invite Hartwick out to talk about this stuff since there are growing calls to rethink how natural resource revenues and wealth are managed. Much of the debate about managing resource wealth in Canada has focused on Alberta’s failure to keep up with Norway’s savings rate, much to the ire of Albertans, who point out the province is a sub-national government, and one that makes major payments into the wider Confederation, while Norway is a sovereign and autonomous state. Alberta’s Heritage Savings Trust Fund was established under former premier Peter Lougheed, who ran the province from 1971 to 1985, and it exists today with about $17.2 billion in assets. But successive governments since his reign have scaled back contributions and, since 2008, Alberta has only added enough each year to ensure the principal isn’t eroded by inflation and population growth. Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said that, for now, Premier Jason Kenney’s government will continue to use funds from natural resources to help correct a budget deficit that is projected to be $24.2 billion this year as a result of the pandemic, or 230 per cent higher than its initial budget deficit estimate of $7.4 billion. However, in a notable turn for the United Conservative government, Toews suggested new revenues could be back in play after previously resisting the idea of new taxes. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “We will be rolling out, basically, a budget reset in 2021,” he said. “Once we have a definitive plan to balance the budget, and at the point we get there, that would be an appropriate time to be asking the question of whether we should be investing in the Heritage Fund or paying down debt.” Toews also noted the province is reviewing its options for “additional fiscal capacity” and revenue sources to lessen its dependence on natural resource extraction. “Down the road, we will need to be looking at our revenue structure and our tax structure and the Heritage Trust Fund and its relationship to non-renewable resource revenues,” he said. Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews. Photo by Courtesy Alberta government Toews’ situation might be a cautionary tale for other provinces. None were blessed with Alberta’s vast stores of both oil and natural gas, but several produce significant quantities of non-renewable natural resources of their own. Currently, the only dedicated Canadian fund that’s sharply growing is Quebec’s Generations Fund, established to eliminate the province’s debt. The fund is projected to grow using revenues from hydroelectricity and mining to $11.7 billion by March 31, 2021, from $8.3 billion this year. But British Columbia now produces a third of Canada’s total natural gas output, and that proportion is growing. Saskatchewan is home to uranium extraction, potash mining and oil and gas. And Ontario and the territories produce significant quantities of copper, zinc, gold, diamonds and other minerals. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “We are not any different than Alberta,” said University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business professor Werner Antweiler, who counts environmental economics and resource management among his research interests. “When you point at Alberta, there are four fingers pointing back at your own jurisdiction.” Former B.C. premier Christy Clark established the Prosperity Fund in 2013 with $100 million and intended to create a $100-billion reserve from the returns on liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. The fund earned $8 million last year and has not been built up even though B.C. wells produce more than five billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. When you point at Alberta, there are four fingers pointing back at your own jurisdiction Werner Antweiler The temptation, always, with these funds is to use the money generated on political pet projects such as investing in the local economy, trying to spur economic diversification or building infrastructure. B.C.’s government posted a $1.5-billion budget surplus in 2019, but Premier John Horgan chose to spend the excess funds on infrastructure rather than make a deposit into the Prosperity Fund. The province’s natural resource revenues almost perfectly matched that budget surplus: not including forestry royalties, the province pulled in $1.4 billion in natural resource revenues that year. Antweiler said there’s a case to be made for using sovereign wealth funds to build infrastructure such as schools and universities in developing countries like Chile, but using those same funds in developed countries, where the need is arguably less, has had a checkered history of success.

Article content continued “Governments aren’t always effective in placing the money in the right spots,” he said. “The future wealth is disappearing because of incompetent management.” Oddly, Canada’s most disadvantaged communities follow the Hartwick Rule to the letter and, partly due to strict regulations, have turned physical assets into financial assets. The future wealth is disappearing because of incompetent management Werner Antweiler Laurence Booth, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, said the Indian Act requires that one asset be replaced with another, so bands have been forced to save their resource wealth and, in a frustrating exercise for many bands, ask the federal government before they’re allowed to spend. Jim Boucher, the former long-time chief of the Fort McKay First Nation in northern Alberta, said his community has been saving natural resource revenues as required in a trust, which has helped diversify the community’s revenues and now generates $5 million per year. “Our philosophy was that we never had a deficit because we couldn’t rely on anybody to bail us out,” he said. Jim Boucher, chief of the Fort McKay First Nation in northern Alberta, in 2014. Photo by Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network files Asked whether it’s frustrating that the provincial governments haven’t followed the same strict rules, Boucher said Canadian provincial governments have a history of running deficits. “We didn’t want to be like the province,” he said. Political calculus has been a driving factor in many resource-wealth decisions in Canada over the years, and that has led to some questionable decisions. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Jack Mintz, the University of Calgary economist who in 2007 chaired a savings panel for former Alberta premier Ed Stelmach on the Heritage Fund that suggested enlarging the fund to $100 billion by 2030, said the provincial government at the time was concerned that building up a huge fund would cause future federal governments to withhold funding for Alberta projects. “Alberta was always shy about building up too large of a Heritage Fund because they were worried that it might become a target for the federal government,” said Mintz, adding that the experiences of several U.S. states suggest that Alberta’s worry about federal pillaging was unfounded. For example, New Mexico paid little mind to Washington when it set up its Land Grant Permanent Fund and Severance Tax Permanent Fund, which combined will pay out US$1.1 billion this year to finance new schools and hospitals. New Mexico used its wealth fund to pay out US$1.1 billion this year to finance new schools and hospitals. Photo by Rick Wilking/Reuters files As good as that sounds, in almost all cases, sovereign funds become the centre of heated debates about their effectiveness or the way they are managed. “We have plenty of examples of sovereign wealth funds around the world, but we have few examples of success,” said Veljko Fotak, associate professor of finance at the University of Buffalo and an expert on sovereign wealth funds. Fotak said funds have been established in some countries to save wealth for future generations, others for local economic development or diversification, and others to invest in infrastructure or to stabilize commodity price fluctuations. In each case, he said, it’s not always clear how effective the funds have been in fulfilling their mandates. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Even on the basis of returns, he said most sovereign wealth funds are selective and biased in what they disclose. The father of the Hartwick Rule has watched these debates about saving non-renewable natural resource revenues play out in Canada and beyond with some detachment. We have plenty of examples of sovereign wealth funds around the world, but we have few examples of success Veljko Fotak “I’m kind of an armchair fiddler, so I don’t get emotionally involved in these things,” Hartwick said. Still, he has a theory now for why certain countries have been better at building up sovereign wealth funds with natural resource revenues than others. Norway has such a small population relative to the size of its resource that “they’ve got the best of both worlds,” Hartwick said. “They’ve been able to assuage the current population by giving them baubles in the private sector and that’s kind of an unusual case.” That, he said, seems to be the key to a national or sub-national government’s success in following his rule: Can you save and spend at the same time?

Posthaste: Canadian grocery bills are set to go higher — and it's not just due to the pandemic Back to video Good morning! The typical grocery bill has gone up 240 per cent over the past two decades — and it’s set to go up higher still, according to Sylvain Charlebois, senior director at Agri-food Analytics Lab at the Dalhousie University, who tracks the country’s food sector. “Some will think that such a percentage is expected, given the effects of inflation. Perhaps, but the overall cost for other products and services in the economy did not increase as much as food did – far from it,” according to the professor, noting that the country’s food price index has been outpacing the general price index over the past twenty years. Statistics Canada’s latest consumer price index shows food prices were the biggest contributor to inflation, rising 1.8 per cent (not seasonally adjusted) in August, compared to the same period last year. In a new note this morning, Charlebois said that while the North American continent has been seen as the realm of discounted food for quite some time, the COVID-19 era and changing consumer preferences are putting new pressures on the food chain. “As affordability remains a priority for the agri-food sector, quality, the provenance of food, and the ecological footprint that our choices represent bring their share of complexity and additional costs,” Charlebois said. “The demanding consumers that we have now become have plenty of choice, all year round. With more innovation, quality is also much, much better, but there is certainly a price to pay for that. As a result, the industry has been catching up to our expectations by managing higher costs and passing some of the increases onto us. It will only get worse with COVID-19. Simple economics.” The economist was also the lead author of the annual Canada’s Food Price Report published earlier this year, which forecast a 2 to 4 per cent increase in food prices in 2020, bringing the predicted annual cost of food for the average Canadian family to $12,667, an increase of $487 over 2019. Prices of key products such as beef have jumped 20 per cent since January, the analyst estimated. While some of the reasons for the price increase had nothing to do with the pandemic, the virus has not made it easier. Canadians new found love for home delivery will also add to our grocery bills. “If you do order online, expect to pay more. On average, including delivery fees, consumers will pay 7 per cent to 10 per cent more for delivered food compared to a regular visit at the grocery store,”Charlebois said in an earlier note. “Quite the difference, perhaps even problematic for those who are stuck home, for one reason or another. The disabled, elderly, and people in self-isolation are compelled to pay more. Optics may make things appear to be unfair, but the socioeconomics of home food delivery will evolve and likely become more competitive.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Trending Article content Canadian mortgages rates are at a record low, but should potential home buyers lock in rates right now or will rates go any lower? Not by much, but yes, rates will go lower is the answer from several analysts citing the Bank of Canada’s policy, competition among lenders, seasonal factors and the pandemic’s impact on the economy. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Canadian mortgage rates are the lowest in history. Can they go any lower? Back to video Canada’s central bank slashed the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 per cent on three separate occasions in March to bring them down to 0.25 per cent. Government of Canada five-year bond yields fell to 0.41 per cent in August from 1.64 per cent last December. Both measures affect how mortgage rates are set. By June most major banks and mortgage brokers were offering five-year fixed-rate loans at less than two per cent. A rate of 1.64 per cent a year can be found on RateHub, a Toronto-based personal finance website co-founded by James Laird.

Article content continued “It seems absurd because we are way lower than the previous record which was 2.09 per cent during the oil crisis in 2017,” Laird said by phone. “Lenders compete with each other and sometimes that causes the margin in lending to shrink, which causes lower mortgage rates.” That competition to snag buyers rushing to take advantage of the cheapest loans ever combined with pent-up demand after the pandemic limited new sales listings in the spring has led to a competitive mortgage market. The lack of supply also accelerated house prices in most markets across Canada, except the Prairies, where oil industry woes and oversupply contributed to price declines. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the country’s largest public mortgage provider, forecasts that house prices could fall by double-digits early next year as the pandemic continues to weigh on the economy and jobs. Other analysts predict price deceleration — though not as steep as predicted by some — and more likely in condos than houses. But they says borrowing costs won’t increase appreciably until after a solid economic recovery is well under way. When that happens depends on the strength of the expected second pandemic wave due this winter and when a vaccine becomes widely available. The fall in the annual inflation rate to 0.1 per cent in August from 2.4 per cent in January has also helped keep interest rates positive in real terms and the central bank is unlikely to let them go negative, according to Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued A home for sale in Toronto. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post files “As we enter the winter days, I think the economic activity will slow down and that usually leads to lower interest rates,” Tal said by phone. “If you look at the Bank of Canada buying in the bond market, they are starting to focus more and more on the two- to five-year rate and they are actually selling 10-and 30-years (bonds). They are reducing their involvement in the long end of the curve and keeping their involvement in the two- to five-years which means they are putting some downward pressure on this segment of the curve.” “These two reasons suggest that we might see some moderate pressure to lower interest rates.” Other analysts say it’s unlikely the Bank of Canada will further cut interest rates — unless something even more calamitous happens to the economy — as it’s already said a few times that 0.25 per cent is as low as it wants to go. Still, the pandemic’s cull of part-time and wage earning jobs is depressing rents and condo prices in urban cores. At the same time, work-from-home arrangements are boosting cottage-area prices and prompting an exodus from high-density urban centres. We might see some moderate pressure to lower interest rates Benjamin Tal “What COVID has done to housing demand is shift it a lot to low-rise and single-detached homes,” Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Royal Bank focusing on the housing market, said by phone. “Single-detached homes will be more resilient that what CMHC has been talking about.” Demand is also affected by the lack of immigration this year, which usually stands about 300,000 annually. And tourism’s decline is putting more Airbnb units back on the market as long-term rentals. Still, Hogue says the housing market has been much more vibrant than what the bank expected. “When you look at how tight markets are across Canada — there are exceptions out there, especially in Alberta, for example — it’s hard to imagine that prices will start declining in very short order,” Hogue said. “There is probably momentum that will carry for a number of months.” As for the potential of borrowing rates to sink further: “They’re incredibly low. I never thought I’d see this in my lifetime, but here we are,” the economist said. “We’re getting pretty close to zero, but what I’ve learned over the last decade is ‘never say never.’” Financial Post Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Canadian mortgage rates are the lowest in history.

Article content The global pandemic is forcing many small businesses to choose between survival and preparing for a technology-driven future, a situation that should prompt policymakers to create incentives for innovators to protect their intellectual property and scale up, according to new research from the Information and Communications Technology Council. Making investments to develop and protect trademarks, designs and other intellectual property is costly, especially across multiple jurisdictions, and the move to survival mode during the pandemic has drawn away from such spending, according to the 27-page report released Thursday by ICTC, which bills itself as a not-for-profit national centre of expertise for strengthening Canada’s digital advantage in a global economy.

Having patents, meanwhile, may also increase the likelihood of receiving venture capital funding. Canada is taking steps to support firms with exploitable intellectual property as they scale up in size, such as through the $160 million set aside recently by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), the authors note. However, the ICTC report says a more “fundamental shift” is needed in Canada “to more effectively consider the value of intangible assets in decisions affecting innovation.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Introduced as part of Quebec’s 2020-21 budget in March, the pilot will create “one of the most competitive corporate tax regimes in North America” for startups, the report suggests. It will allow eligible companies to be taxed provincially at two per cent, rather than Quebec’s general income tax rate of 11.5 per cent. “When added to the federal general rate, it will result in a combined tax rate of 17 per cent for qualifying businesses, one of the lowest rates in Canada and the U.S.,” the report says. “Although the results of this initiative remain to be seen … the competitiveness and innovative nature of this regime is likely to pay strong dividends for Quebec businesses as well as attract savvy foreign innovators to the province.” There is no shortage of innovation taking place among Canadian businesses, according to the report, but the challenge remains for startups to transform their innovative ideas into scalable and sustainable business models. A “strong and resilient scale-up ecosystem in Canada… can shape and support globally competitive Canadian anchor companies in a future where the digital economy will lead the way,” the report concludes.

Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Article Sidebar Share Share this Story: Banking watchdog says no plans to bring back special treatment for deferred loans despite second wave Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Trending Article content Canada might be in the middle of a second wave of COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean a federal banking regulator is about to enable a second wave of deferred mortgage payments. Superintendent of Financial Institutions Jeremy Rudin said Friday that, in the early days of the pandemic, banks and insurers had to be in a position where they could make “almost blanket judgments” on granting loan and premium payment deferrals. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Banking watchdog says no plans to bring back special treatment for deferred loans despite second wave Back to video The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) allowed those deferred loans and premiums to be treated like they were still being paid for up to six months, which meant the banks and insurers avoided having to set aside more capital. Six months in, though, Rudin said his office believed the financial industry was ready to go back to a case-by-case basis for its deferrals. OSFI announced at the end of August that it would phase out the special capital treatment for deferrals, and the regulator is not currently planning on reversing that decision, despite a second wave of COVID-19 cases hitting Canada. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “Obviously, if we get into a situation where blanket decisions again are required then, of course, we’d have to consider making a further change or perhaps reversing our previous decision,” Rudin said Friday during a conference call with reporters. “But that’s not the situation in which we find ourselves.” Yet Rudin’s comments come as Canada’s COVID-19 cases have been shooting up again, prompting some governments to reimpose restrictions on certain businesses, and as a number of borrowers are still deferring loan payments. Meanwhile, loan and premium payment deferrals granted after Sept. 30 are no longer subject to OSFI’s special capital treatment. 32% of the 778,000 people who deferred their mortgage payments have resumed repayment Still, OSFI said in August that the decision to wind down the special treatment reflected that the measures were meant to be temporary, and that the financial institutions were still free to grant deferrals on a case-by-case basis if they so chose. According to the Canadian Bankers Association, more than 778,000 people had been allowed to defer or skip their mortgage payments as of the end of August, with approximately 32 per cent of those people having resumed repayment. “There’s nothing that prevents banks from continuing to offer deferrals,” Rudin said. “We’re just phasing out the extraordinary capital treatment because it’s no longer necessary.” Rudin’s comments on Friday also came after the regulator and the Bank of Canada had just finished hosting a virtual get-together for financial watchdogs, the International Conference for Banking Supervisors. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Although the conference allowed regulators to talk shop and discuss various trends in the banking sector, there was at least one note of caution about the loans that financial institutions are currently sitting on. A keynote speech given by Pablo Hernández de Cos, the chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the governor of the Bank of Spain, warned that it was only a question of “when, not if,” asset quality at banks would worsen during the pandemic. “A resurgence in COVID-19 cases coupled with the unwinding of support measures could further magnify the crystallization of bank losses,” the governor said, according to a copy of his speech. “The mutation of this crisis into a banking one would be devastating.” Yet so far the watchdogs of the international financial system see their job as having been done pretty well. And unlike the global financial crisis a decade ago, the COVID-19 crisis didn’t emanate from banks, which have also been called upon by governments to help deliver assistance to hard-hit people and businesses. “All the supervisors around the globe have demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in maintaining the important balance between bank resilience and the need to keep credit flowing to companies and households to support their resilience,” said Carolyn Rogers, the Basel Committee’s secretary general and a former OSFI assistant superintendent, during the conference call with reporters. • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Banking watchdog says no plans to bring back special treatment for deferred loans despite second wave Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Superintendent of Financial Institutions Jeremy Rudin said Friday that, in the early days of the pandemic, banks and insurers had to be in a position where they could make “almost blanket judgments” on granting loan and premium payment deferrals.

Banking watchdog says no plans to bring back special treatment for deferred loans despite second wave Back to video The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) allowed those deferred loans and premiums to be treated like they were still being paid for up to six months, which meant the banks and insurers avoided having to set aside more capital. Six months in, though, Rudin said his office believed the financial industry was ready to go back to a case-by-case basis for its deferrals. OSFI announced at the end of August that it would phase out the special capital treatment for deferrals, and the regulator is not currently planning on reversing that decision, despite a second wave of COVID-19 cases hitting Canada.

Article content continued “Obviously, if we get into a situation where blanket decisions again are required then, of course, we’d have to consider making a further change or perhaps reversing our previous decision,” Rudin said Friday during a conference call with reporters. “But that’s not the situation in which we find ourselves.” Yet Rudin’s comments come as Canada’s COVID-19 cases have been shooting up again, prompting some governments to reimpose restrictions on certain businesses, and as a number of borrowers are still deferring loan payments. Meanwhile, loan and premium payment deferrals granted after Sept. 30 are no longer subject to OSFI’s special capital treatment. 32% of the 778,000 people who deferred their mortgage payments have resumed repayment Still, OSFI said in August that the decision to wind down the special treatment reflected that the measures were meant to be temporary, and that the financial institutions were still free to grant deferrals on a case-by-case basis if they so chose. According to the Canadian Bankers Association, more than 778,000 people had been allowed to defer or skip their mortgage payments as of the end of August, with approximately 32 per cent of those people having resumed repayment. “There’s nothing that prevents banks from continuing to offer deferrals,” Rudin said. “We’re just phasing out the extraordinary capital treatment because it’s no longer necessary.” Rudin’s comments on Friday also came after the regulator and the Bank of Canada had just finished hosting a virtual get-together for financial watchdogs, the International Conference for Banking Supervisors. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Although the conference allowed regulators to talk shop and discuss various trends in the banking sector, there was at least one note of caution about the loans that financial institutions are currently sitting on. A keynote speech given by Pablo Hernández de Cos, the chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the governor of the Bank of Spain, warned that it was only a question of “when, not if,” asset quality at banks would worsen during the pandemic. “A resurgence in COVID-19 cases coupled with the unwinding of support measures could further magnify the crystallization of bank losses,” the governor said, according to a copy of his speech. “The mutation of this crisis into a banking one would be devastating.” Yet so far the watchdogs of the international financial system see their job as having been done pretty well. And unlike the global financial crisis a decade ago, the COVID-19 crisis didn’t emanate from banks, which have also been called upon by governments to help deliver assistance to hard-hit people and businesses. “All the supervisors around the globe have demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in maintaining the important balance between bank resilience and the need to keep credit flowing to companies and households to support their resilience,” said Carolyn Rogers, the Basel Committee’s secretary general and a former OSFI assistant superintendent, during the conference call with reporters. • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Banking watchdog says no plans to bring back special treatment for deferred loans despite second wave Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

It was raining and her clothes were wet, but a friend insisted it wasn’t a fancy party so she shouldn’t worry about that. Once inside, she discovered the other women were wearing long gowns, necklaces and earrings. The friend who invited her was in a three-piece suit. Benny Beck was the only other person at the party wearing jeans, and he went to talk to Anna after she ducked into a quieter room. The two kept talking after the party, almost every day on the phone. Both had kids from a previous relationship, both loved cooking, both were Danish immigrants — though virtually everyone at the birthday party was Danish, since the restaurant and campground were part of a Danish cultural centre in the countryside north of Hamilton.

'It's heartbreaking': Inside the fall of a family restaurant Back to video After they got together, the couple spent summers with their big, blended family in a trailer parked at the campground. They talked about quitting their jobs in Toronto and opening a restaurant. In 2000, the restaurant on the Danish centre’s property came up for lease and the pair took it over and moved into the apartment upstairs.

They served homestyle dishes from Denmark. They hosted and catered Danish weddings, anniversaries, christenings and funerals, sometimes all for the same family. The restaurant used to be called Sunset Villa, but whenever people called in for reservations, they’d double check: Is this the Danish place? Benny Beck and Anna Lewis behind the bar of their restaurant in Puslinch, Ont., in 2000, shortly after they took it over. Photo by Courtesy of Kristine Mathers “Finally, Benny and I said, ‘We’re changing the name to The Danish Place,'” Anna recalls. The pair cooked and catered at the Danish Place for nearly 20 years and stayed involved after the next generation of their family took over. But since the pandemic hit in March, the Danish Place, like thousands of other restaurants and bars in Canada, has been in a downward spiral. The restaurant has not been able to run a large wedding, funeral or any big function. It hasn’t been anywhere close to capacity for lunch or dinner, either. And building a trade in takeout from a compound in the woods was never a viable option. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The crisis in the restaurant industry is often described by how enormous it is. The latest estimates put the number of closures since March at far more than 10,000 establishments, though the real count is almost certainly higher. Benny Beck and Anna Lewis on The Danish Place’s last day of operation. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Restaurant advocates warn that this winter will be even more destructive for the sector than the early shutdowns last spring, since anxiety over COVID-19 is once again rising and patios are closing. But what’s easy to miss in all the talk of mass closures, public health restrictions and government subsidies is that this is a crisis playing out thousands of times over, one flailing restaurant after another, each a protracted and painful time for the people who built that business. *** For two decades, Benny Beck drove around southern Ontario looking for ingredients. There was a bakery in Toronto that had the right kind of rye bread for open-faced sandwiches, and a fishmonger in Woodstock who sold eel. He and his wife, Anna, did most of the baking and cooking at the restaurant they owned. “Our theory always was: If it looks heavy, it’s Benny’s job,” she said. They took their breaks together, smoking outside the back door. Even when Beck was shopping, Anna would sometimes catch herself lighting two cigarettes out of habit. But after a car crash six years ago, it started to become difficult for the couple to stay on their feet for 10 to 12 hours a day. They wanted to retire and their kids took over the restaurant in 2018. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Kristine Mathers, along with her brother Jacob Beck and his partner, Joanne Moyes, spent roughly $80,000 renovating the restaurant between 2018 and 2019. They brought in new furniture and shiplapped walls, replaced fixtures, refinished the wood floors and updated the kitchen. Kristine Mathers speaks with customers on The Danish Place’s last day of operation. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post “We painted every single inch of that space,” said Mathers, who has worked at the restaurant since she was 17. They also used an agency to update their marketing for a younger demographic. By the time the pandemic hit, they said they had paid off $60,000 of their initial investments. Their parents never really left the restaurant, Mathers said. After the place switched hands, her mom still came in to bake the layer and meringue cakes. Her dad still drove around picking up ingredients. Mathers found that her dad had a way of just glancing around the dining room and knowing what it needed. “He’d just pop down all of a sudden and be like, ‘Kristine, do you need ice?’ And I’m like, ‘Oh wow, dad, yeah I do need ice,” she said. “He’d just be, ‘Oh yeah, I figured it was busy enough.'” An employee delivers slices of cake to customers on The Danish Place’s last day of operations. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post The restaurant closed for two months after Christmas 2019, since January and February were historically slow. It reopened in March and they had two decent weeks before the economic lockdown orders came in because of COVID-19. “We took out our first loan the first week,” Mathers said. “We’re slowly watching that loan go down and absolutely no money come in.” Through the spring, the restaurant crept further into debt. The siblings opted to take the federal government’s interest-free $40,000 loan. They applied for the federal wage subsidy program, too. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Still, by the time the restaurant reopened in July, the owners said it was roughly $70,000 in debt. “We racked it up pretty quick,” said Moyes, who manages the books. “We basically have carried seven months of debt of just running this business with no money coming in.” Plates of food awaiting delivery to customers at The Danish Place. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post They tried to run leaner. They reduced employee hours. They tried offering takeout, but few customers were willing to make the long drive to the restaurant. They cut the expensive items from the menu — steaks, shrimp, scallops, eels — so they didn’t lose as much when inventory rotted. “The only way a restaurant makes money is if they run at full capacity and you can turn and turn and turn your tables,” Moyes said. “It’s a ghost town. How can you make anywhere close to the money that you need?” It’s a ghost town. How can you make anywhere close to the money that you need? Joanne Moyes After restrictions eased in the summer, they were able to use 36 of the 120 possible seats inside and 20 seats on the patio. Moyes said sales were down by 75 per cent from the previous summer, hit especially hard by the disappearance of big catering events. The restaurant managed a profit in just a single month this year, making $2,000 in September. “We’ve incurred a substantial amount of personal debt to try to make it through,” Moyes said. “Where’s the money going to come from? The next step is to sell our homes.” *** The hard truth for the restaurant industry is that this summer’s bustling patio season gave the illusion of success. Even with full patios, most restaurants were only breaking even at best, because they were still well below normal capacity but saddled with the same costs.

Article content continued A recent forecast by trade association Restaurants Canada suggested that hospitality sales will not rebound to pre-pandemic levels until 2022. Chris Elliott, a senior economist at Restaurants Canada, said the best gauge on closures so far is Statistics Canada’s bi-annual business register, the latest instalment of which doesn’t come out until next month. The darkest days of this pandemic are ahead of us, not behind us Andrew Oliver, chief executive, Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality Inc. But by consulting with major restaurant suppliers, Elliott said the best estimate is that more than 10,000 had already shut down as of August, or roughly 10 per cent of the 98,000 restaurants, bars and caterers that were operating before the pandemic. That number is likely much higher today and will be even higher tomorrow. “The darkest days of this pandemic are ahead of us, not behind us,” said Andrew Oliver, chief executive at Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality Inc. and one of the most outspoken industry advocates and critics of the federal government’s small-business subsidies. “Now you have a situation where strong guys are going to fail.” Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants President and CEO Andrew Oliver at Canoe in Toronto in February. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post files After nine months of major sales declines, many restaurants are limping into winter without any savings left and no one is willing to lend them any more money, said Oliver, whose restaurant empire includes Canoe, the famed Bay Street haunt in Toronto. “No bank is going to sit there and say, ‘Hey, we’ll just lend to you until the government lets you open,’” he said. “If you’re going to borrow money or invest money in your business, you’re selling your house, you’re selling your assets, you’re selling your car, you’re selling whatever you’ve got to sell.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Some restaurants, however, are trying to hang on. At Roux Bistro & Bar, in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood, chef and owner Derrick Markland figures he needs to make roughly $550 a night to cover his costs. But with no more patio traffic and indoor dining banned in Toronto until restrictions lift, he isn’t making that. “Last night was basically maybe three orders,” he said in mid-October. “I can’t take on the loss forever. I know that. I’ve got my wife telling me, ‘Listen, you’ve got to shut this thing down.’ But at the same time, I have this overwhelming idea that it’s going to get better soon and it’s going to work out.'” Roux Bistro and Bar owner Derrick Markland at his restaurant in Toronto. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Markland, 58, started as a chef in Toronto in the 1980s. He worked at a few major hotels, then switched to running big catering operations. Nearing the end of his career, he wanted his own little restaurant. “That’s the emotional attachment. I worked for a long time in the restaurant business. This is what I wanted as a final goal for my career,” he said. “It’s hard to explain that to other people who say, why don’t you close that down? Well, it’s not that easy. It’s hard to say why … maybe I don’t want to go work for someone else at this age.” Even if he was willing to work for another restaurant, he worries it would be tough to find work in the struggling industry as an older executive chef. “I’m holding onto what I have, even though I know what I have isn’t making me any money at the moment,” he said. “It’s going to take me at least two, two-and-a-half years, with the amount of debt I have, to catch up.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued *** In the middle of October, Jacob Beck, Joanne Moyes and Kristine Mathers were at the bar in the Danish Place looking at their reservation book for the weekend. It was grim. “There might have been less than 10 reservations,” he said. “And a lot of those actually cancelled, because people were being encouraged to stay home and not go out.” The Danish Place was not in one of Ontario’s designated COVID-19 hot spots, so it didn’t have to shut down indoor dining in October like restaurants in Toronto, Ottawa, and Peel and York regions did. But elevated public health concerns, as the province lurched into a second wave of infections, kept customers away. “We came to the point where we’re not willing to give up our homes in order to sustain this business,” Moyes said. Their landlord, the not-for-profit Sunset Villa Association, had stepped in and raised $138,000 through a GoFundMe campaign in the summer. Anna Lewis, left, works on an order with an employee during the restaurant’s last day. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post They came to an agreement that the club would dole out chunks of the money to help prop up the restaurant through the pandemic. If the restaurant couldn’t last, the payments would essentially amount to the club buying the business. By October, the club had paid out $97,500 to the restaurant and it still was struggling to break even. The partners couldn’t see a way out. They worried they would burn through the club’s money and be right back in the same place: struggling along with a few customers and piling up more personal debt. “We didn’t want to leave the club in a lurch,” Beck said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Instead, they decided to break their lease. As per the agreement, the club bought the restaurant’s name and furnishings for $1, and took over its lease on the kitchen equipment. Next, they had to tell their parents. Mathers said the phone call was simple. Her parents knew it was coming. Anna Lewis, left, Benny Beck, right, and their daughter Kristine, centre, at the family’s restaurant in 2000. Photo by Courtesy of Kristine Mathers “My dad magically knew that I needed ice. He also knows, just by looking, what’s happening,” she said. “They’re very seasoned at this.” The owners announced their decision and were flooded with reservations in their restaurant’s final two weeks. Mathers didn’t have much time to think deeply on what was happening, to be 38 years old and starting over, walking away with her one-third share of the restaurant’s total debt. “I’ve worked there for more than half my life now,” she said. “I’m pretty terrified.” The calls kept coming in the final week. By lunch on Nov. 1, the final service, the kitchen was running out of ingredients. Mathers was crossing items off the paper menus: no more liver pate sandwiches, no more lemon mousse, no more Carlsberg tall cans. I’ve worked there for more than half my life now. I'm pretty terrified Kristine Mathers They weren’t taking credit or debit, because they didn’t want to pay the bank for a whole month of the service, and the ATM was down, so they took e-transfers. Benny Beck was out buying more bread and Anna was in the kitchen, standing over plates of open-faced sandwiches. “Who has three hands?” she called out to a group of servers. Jacob Beck, who took over the kitchen when his parents retired, made a point of leaving his post to walk around the dining room.

Article content continued “What I find most difficult is just realizing how many of our customers are going to miss it just as much as I will,” he said, tucked in a hallway off the kitchen beside a line of white cakes. He started to cry. “Just trying to get through the day,” he said. He went back to work. Benny Beck, left, and Anna Lewis, right, embrace a long time customer on the restaurant’s last day. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post As lunch wound down, Benny snuck out back for a break. Anna showed up a few minutes later. They were metres away from the little room where they met 42 years ago. She lit two cigarettes and passed one to Benny, then she picked up his coffee cup and sipped it. “Now, when we’re not so busy anymore, it hits,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking, not so much for ourselves, but the kids.” Benny started to tremble. “What do you do?” he said.

Canadian households are spending a disproportionate share of emergency support money on imported consumer goods, meaning government efforts aren’t as effective as they could be, Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC, said in a report published Tuesday. More than 50 per cent of every dollar spent on clothes, for example, goes to pay suppliers abroad, compared with services such as haircuts, where most of the money goes toward paying staff and fixed costs like rent, the economist said.

How Canada's emergency virus spending is leaking to other countries Back to video “Purchases have actually been heavily skewed toward consumer goods at the expense of services during the pandemic, and that’s costing the economy and governments in Canada money,” Mendes said in the report, adding the clothing sector creates half as many jobs as the restaurant industry for every dollar in sales.

Article content continued If nothing is done to fix the leakage, governments may have to spend more on fiscal support than other larger or less-open economies, Mendes said. Canada has already spent the most in the Group of 20 on its pandemic response relative to the size of its economy, yet employment and gross domestic product outcomes have been similar to those in countries such as the U.S., according to CIBC. More On This Topic Canadian economy hangs in the balance as U.S. elections affect stimulus plans Canada expands path to citizenship for foreigners in bid to stem immigration drop The only thing Canadians are optimistic about right now is the housing market Canada’s economic recovery heading towards an uncertain future after a sunny summer In July, the Canadian government estimated its budget deficit would soar to $343 billion (US$264 billion) this year, or 16 per cent of total output, mostly on support for workers and businesses affected by COVID-19. It has since announced an additional $40 billion in spending. “Now, it’s true that Canada’s dollars have translated into far fewer COVID-related deaths as a proportion of the population than the next five biggest spenders on the list,” Mendes wrote. “But it’s also likely that part of the reason Canada has had to spend so much is because of the leakages we’ve discussed.” Governments have some options to plug the leaks, Mendes says, such as ramping up the availability of rapid COVID-19 testing to make Canadians feel safe so they can support service-oriented firms. Other possibilities include cutting the sales tax on services or directly subsidizing indoor dining, patios or take-out food, depending on the state of local health restrictions, he said. Although these will be costly measures up front for the government, doing nothing could ultimately cost more. “If these programs work, we might have to spend less money on propping up businesses and individuals employed in that sector,” Mendes said by phone.

Unemployment remained virtually unchanged, slipping to 8.9 per cent last month from nine per cent in September. That is the lowest it has been since the pandemic high of 13.7 per cent in May, which captured the effects of a government-triggered recession at the beginning of spring, Statistics Canada said on Friday.

Job growth lost momentum in October amid 'tug of war' between secure and pandemic-hobbled industries Back to video The numbers are slightly stronger than the consensus of 58,000 positions anticipated by economists on Bay Street, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Most of the gains were in full-time employment, where 69,000 new positions were added, something viewed as a positive by economists. Overall growth, however, was unevenly distributed across provinces and industries. More On This Topic Canada's recovery is back to where we were five months ago — and slipping fast Ontario budget projects record $38.5 billion deficit as battle against pandemic takes financial toll Canadian economy hangs in the balance as U.S. elections affect stimulus plans Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Deloitte chief economist Craig Alexander described the uneven landscape of the job market as a ‘tug of war,’ in which virus-vulnerable industries suffered significant job losses that were offset by other industries better equipped to weather surges. For the first time since April, employment in the accommodation and food service industry fell by 48,000 jobs last month because of tightening public health measures, with 42,000 of those positions lost in Quebec. Though there was little change in employment in the information, culture and recreation industry across the country, Quebec saw a loss of 11,000 positions while Alberta dropped 7,200 jobs. At the outset of October’s labour force survey, the Quebec government placed major regions that included cities such as Montreal, Sherbrooke and Quebec City in the red zone — the most restrictive category of its tiered approach to containing the second wave of the virus. Restaurants, bars, theatres, gyms and recreation facilities all were forced to shut down. “The types of restrictions imposed so far, concentrated on restaurants, bars and other services, will continue to dampen employment but by themselves are not enough to cause large declines,” Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in an email to the Financial Post. Service-producing industries, especially wholesale and retail trade; professional, scientific and technical services; and educational services all exceeded their pre-COVID-19 levels of employment, offsetting some of the losses in the food and recreation industries. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Employment increased in five provinces — Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland — while the rest of the provinces remained steady, StatCan reported. The gains over the past few months suggested the country had recouped many of the jobs lost at the outset of the pandemic. In October, Canada was 3.3 per cent below its pre-pandemic levels of employment. Hours of work increased by 0.8 per cent, outpacing overall employment growth which went up half a per cent from September. For the first time since the economic shutdowns, the number of self-employed Canadians rose (1.2 per cent). With the rise in COVID-19 cases across the country reaching record levels in October, more Canadians also began to work from home — approximately 150,000. Alexander, however, pointed out that we are now seeing some of the long-range consequences of a government-triggered economic shutdown. Long-term unemployment, which Statistics Canada defines as being jobless for longer than 27 weeks, rose more than 50 per cent in October from September, with 151,000 people who lost jobs in March and April remaining unemployed since then. “We are now seeing more economic scars from the recession,” Alexander told the Post. The overall positive gains the country has seen since emerging from lockdown may not last, some economists warn. What was great “leaps and bounds early on are now baby steps,” Sri Thanabalasingam, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank wrote. Douglas Porter, the chief economist at Bank of Montreal, warned that jobs gains will be “increasingly tough to come by, especially in the face of renewed restrictions in many provinces.” • Email: bbharti@postmedia.com | Twitter: biancabharti Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Job growth lost momentum in October amid 'tug of war' between secure and pandemic-hobbled industries Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Doing business in the U.S. will never be the same after election comes close to worst-case scenario Back to video “It’s a great time to be a political risk consultant,” Ian Bremmer, founder of Eurasia Group, told me at an event in Toronto in January. Imagine what it’s like now that the president of the United States has said he will turn to the Supreme Court to nullify millions of votes for no apparent reason other than those ballots could deny him a second term. The “Beacon on the Hill” has gone dim, meaning there will be lots of opportunity for outfits that specialize in guiding companies through the dark spaces of hyper-partisan politics and a polarized electorate. The U.S. result “will deepen the institutional erosion,” Bremmer told reporters during a videoconference on the morning of Nov. 4. “You can’t think of the United States as the same kind of representative democracy as (for example) Germany.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued You do feel like you are watching the waning days of U.S. global leadership Eric Miller, a Canadian who runs Rideau Potomac Strategy Group Markets have been a poor mirror on the real economy for years, and, true to form, they cast a false halo over the U.S. vote. Stocks rose, despite the unsettled results and the troubled state of the world’s most important economy. So much for investors craving certainty. Still, that probably means the U.S. Federal Reserve can hold off on additional stimulus for now. Jerome Powell, the chair, won’t want to bring attention to himself and the Fed at a time like this unless it’s essential. But whether that calm will hold is another question. COVID-19 remains an acute issue in the U.S. and the economy needs help from a political class that is at war with itself. More On This Topic The Bank of Canada is supposed to be independent, but it might not hurt if it knew what Finance was up to The Great Rethink: Why Canada needs to return to its ‘honest broker’ role in world affairs Canada is having a much better crisis than the U.S., though some fret about debt and deficits “At what point do markets get nervous?” said Eric Miller, a Canadian who runs Rideau Potomac Strategy Group, a political and regulatory adviser based in Washington. “You do feel like you are watching the waning days of U.S. global leadership.” Some in Alberta’s oil patch will disagree, but a Democratic wave would have been the best outcome for Canada. Joe Biden is both a northerner and a known quantity, since he was first elected to federal office in 1973. He would calm things down. A Democratic majority in the Senate would have brought a unified government, clearing the way for the large stimulus program that House speaker Nancy Pelosi has been struggling to get approved.

Article content continued It’s true that Washington would re-emerge as a barrier to TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline. Still, the Canadian economy grows when the U.S. economy grows, and both economies could use a boost to push through the current spike in COVID-19 infections: Canada’s gross domestic product surged to an annual rate of almost 50 per cent in the third quarter, but will slow to a rate of one per cent this quarter, according to the Bank of Canada. More demand from the U.S., whatever the source, would make a big difference. Canadian merchandise exports were worth about $46 billion in September, compared with about $49 billion a year earlier, Statistics Canadareported on Nov. 4. However, lumber shipments were worth $1.6 billion, the highest in 14 years. That’s almost entirely the result of earlier U.S. stimulus efforts, which sparked a boom in home construction and renovations this summer. But Washington’s rescue budget has been spent and few economists think the recovery will continue without another push from a group of policy-makers that was struggling to find common ground ahead of the election. Congress and the White House will agree on something, but it probably won’t be as generous as it would have been if the Democratic candidates had been as successful as the polls on Nov. 3 suggested they were going to be. “With the Democrats looking increasingly likely to fall short of a majority in the Senate, hopes for a repeat of this spring’s cross-aisle coronavirus rescue package are fading,” Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments, said in a note to clients. “Without substantial fiscal stimulus, bankruptcies and layoffs are likely to continue rising in the United States, forcing household savings rates back up — and consumer spending back down.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued To be sure, the result could have been worse. Biden appears on track to win the electoral college, which would represent a victory for decency over an administration that encouraged misogyny, racism and serial lying. Biden would be also a constructive participant in the global fights against the pandemic and climate change, and would probably end Donald Trump’s efforts to sabotage the World Trade Organization. But Biden won’t be able to erase the past four years. There is no going back, at least not all the way back. More than 67 million Americans cast a ballot for the candidate who encouraged misogyny, racism and serial lying. They won’t be happy about losing, and other politicians will emerge to represent them. There is no obvious ground for compromise with a Democratic base that has lurched to the left. Uncertainty has become a permanent part of the landscape, complicating any attempt to plan anything that exceeds the electoral calendar. “The people who voted for Trump are still out there,” Miller said. “Four years from now, what do things look like?” The answer to that question, no matter who was in the White House, used to be: not so different from the previous four years.” The answer to that question now: who the hell knows? It will take some time to get used to that. • Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Doing business in the U.S. will never be the same after election comes close to worst-case scenario Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

It was a stunning reversal of fortune for the network of trendy restaurants including Italian eatery Buca and Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse. Less than a year ago, plans were under way to open more concepts in and around Canada’s largest city. “Alongside the entire hospitality sector, the COVID-19 pandemic has put us in an extremely difficult situation that was beyond our control,” Tsebelis said in a statement on Nov. 9.

'An earthquake is coming': Insolvency second wave looms as once-strong businesses falter Back to video The filing signals an even more unfortunate turn to those who spend their days dealing with restructurings and insolvencies. To them, it means the economic impact has spilled over from the usual suspects in sectors such as retail and cannabis that had problems before the spread of COVID-19 slammed the brakes on normal daily life.

Article content continued “King Street Company’s filing … likely marks the start of a new wave, where previously healthy industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic begin to falter,” said Rob Fedrock, principal at Origin Merchant Partners. “The restaurant space is a prime example,” he said, adding that with indoor dining restrictions and the end of the patio season, “fine dining restaurants are in for a tough ride.” More On This Topic Fears of poverty, insolvency, unemployment top of mind for stressed out Canadians Insolvency filings fall at record pace as consumers, businesses cling to government support More Canadian firms than ever are seeking creditor protection Here’s what it looks like when Canadian retailers seek creditor protection And the ripples could keep spreading, insolvency specialists warn. Linc Rogers, a partner at Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, said it’s clear to him there are a number of “zombie” companies staggering on in Canada, appearing nearly normal yet propped up only by government subsidies, wage support, tax remittance deferrals and general government-backed stimulus. “They are being artificially kept alive,” said Rogers, who specializes in complex restructurings and distressed financings and acquisitions. He is expecting an explosion of work once those supports dry up. Combined with a reluctance of bankers to call loans in an environment where asset values could be significantly depressed, the government supports merely “allowed many stressed companies to delay the inevitable,” he said.

Article content continued “Even though we’ve only felt the tremors so far, we all believe an earthquake is coming.” Those tremors include a growing line of filings and restructurings in the retail sector, one that was hit particularly hard hit by the pandemic but was already struggling. Even though we’ve only felt the tremors so far, we all believe an earthquake is coming Linc Rogers, partner at Blake, Cassels & Graydon Lawyers on the insolvency team at law firm Stikeman Elliott LLP in Toronto say year-to-date public filings by retailers for insolvency-related proceedings are already “more than double what was filed last year.” The list of more than two dozen companies that have filed for relief under the Companies’ Creditor Protection Act includes household names such as Pier 1 Imports Inc. and Davids Tea Inc. and apparel retailers Reitmans Ltd., Aldo, J. Crew Group LLC, Le Chateau Inc., Mendocino Clothing Company Ltd., Groupe Dynamite Inc., and Moores the Suit People Inc. Reitmans is among the Canadian companies that have filed for creditor protection so far this year. Photo by Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press Rogers said temporary closures and a decline in foot traffic due to the pandemic and measures to control it merely accelerated the impact of earlier miscalculations, such as taking on debt and aggressive expansion. This, in turn, hampered the ability to pivot to online sales. “The pandemic exposed that latent defect” in the sector, he said. “The burden of paying interest on the debt means that the enterprise doesn’t have enough funds to invest in capital improvements needed to remain competitive.” Unable to adapt to a more locked-down society impaired the ability to even maintain debt servicing for some, leaving creditor protection the only option, he said.

Article content continued Shayne Kukulowicz a partner at Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP, and chair of the firm’s restructuring and insolvency group, said some proceeding could cure operational or balance sheet issues and a streamlined business may emerge. But much depends on the trajectory of the spread of COVID-19, rolling lockdowns and the development of a vaccine. “An insolvency proceeding won’t increase the number of customers at a restaurant,” Kukulowicz said. One thing struggling businesses appear to have in their favour at the moment is a reluctance by bankers to pull the plug on loans in the midst of a global economic and public health crisis. A restaurant in Toronto with a “Take Out Only” sign. Photo by Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press files “Banks may be concerned about the optics of enforcing against companies that are struggling due to external factors,” said Kukulowicz. In addition, he said, the “practical reality” right now is that it would lead to a distress sale with a dearth of buyers for assets in hard-hit sectors. Rogers said Canada’s large banks are “cognizant of reputational issues,” which may be keeping them from calling loans where businesses are falling behind in payments, or are likely to do so once government support disappears. “They understand their critical role in supporting Canadian business and the far reaching consequences that would occur should that support waiver,” he said. Banks may be concerned about the optics of enforcing against companies that are struggling due to external factors Shayne Kukulowicz, partner at Cassels Brock & Blackwell But their “measured patience” is also driven by solid business reasons. “Banks are rational and pragmatic commercial actors and take a long-term strategic view,” he said. “Who wants to sell a distressed airline or hotel in this environment?” Still, as the winter and holiday season approaches, travel and related businesses from airlines to hotels to car rental agencies — and now restaurants — will be on the watchlists of insolvency and restructuring experts. These sectors “will remain under stress as customers elect to remain close to home,” said Rogers.

It was raining and her clothes were wet, but a friend insisted it wasn’t a fancy party so she shouldn’t worry about that. Once inside, she discovered the other women were wearing long gowns, necklaces and earrings. The friend who invited her was in a three-piece suit. Benny Beck was the only other person at the party wearing jeans, and he went to talk to Anna after she ducked into a quieter room. The two kept talking after the party, almost every day on the phone. Both had kids from a previous relationship, both loved cooking, both were Danish immigrants — though virtually everyone at the birthday party was Danish, since the restaurant and campground were part of a Danish cultural centre in the countryside north of Hamilton.

'It's heartbreaking': Inside the fall of a family restaurant Back to video After they got together, the couple spent summers with their big, blended family in a trailer parked at the campground. They talked about quitting their jobs in Toronto and opening a restaurant. In 2000, the restaurant on the Danish centre’s property came up for lease and the pair took it over and moved into the apartment upstairs.

They served homestyle dishes from Denmark. They hosted and catered Danish weddings, anniversaries, christenings and funerals, sometimes all for the same family. The restaurant used to be called Sunset Villa, but whenever people called in for reservations, they’d double check: Is this the Danish place? Benny Beck and Anna Lewis behind the bar of their restaurant in Puslinch, Ont., in 2000, shortly after they took it over. Photo by Courtesy of Kristine Mathers “Finally, Benny and I said, ‘We’re changing the name to The Danish Place,'” Anna recalls. The pair cooked and catered at the Danish Place for nearly 20 years and stayed involved after the next generation of their family took over. But since the pandemic hit in March, the Danish Place, like thousands of other restaurants and bars in Canada, has been in a downward spiral. The restaurant has not been able to run a large wedding, funeral or any big function. It hasn’t been anywhere close to capacity for lunch or dinner, either. And building a trade in takeout from a compound in the woods was never a viable option. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The crisis in the restaurant industry is often described by how enormous it is. The latest estimates put the number of closures since March at far more than 10,000 establishments, though the real count is almost certainly higher. Benny Beck and Anna Lewis on The Danish Place’s last day of operation. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Restaurant advocates warn that this winter will be even more destructive for the sector than the early shutdowns last spring, since anxiety over COVID-19 is once again rising and patios are closing. But what’s easy to miss in all the talk of mass closures, public health restrictions and government subsidies is that this is a crisis playing out thousands of times over, one flailing restaurant after another, each a protracted and painful time for the people who built that business. *** For two decades, Benny Beck drove around southern Ontario looking for ingredients. There was a bakery in Toronto that had the right kind of rye bread for open-faced sandwiches, and a fishmonger in Woodstock who sold eel. He and his wife, Anna, did most of the baking and cooking at the restaurant they owned. “Our theory always was: If it looks heavy, it’s Benny’s job,” she said. They took their breaks together, smoking outside the back door. Even when Beck was shopping, Anna would sometimes catch herself lighting two cigarettes out of habit. But after a car crash six years ago, it started to become difficult for the couple to stay on their feet for 10 to 12 hours a day. They wanted to retire and their kids took over the restaurant in 2018. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Kristine Mathers, along with her brother Jacob Beck and his partner, Joanne Moyes, spent roughly $80,000 renovating the restaurant between 2018 and 2019. They brought in new furniture and shiplapped walls, replaced fixtures, refinished the wood floors and updated the kitchen. Kristine Mathers speaks with customers on The Danish Place’s last day of operation. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post “We painted every single inch of that space,” said Mathers, who has worked at the restaurant since she was 17. They also used an agency to update their marketing for a younger demographic. By the time the pandemic hit, they said they had paid off $60,000 of their initial investments. Their parents never really left the restaurant, Mathers said. After the place switched hands, her mom still came in to bake the layer and meringue cakes. Her dad still drove around picking up ingredients. Mathers found that her dad had a way of just glancing around the dining room and knowing what it needed. “He’d just pop down all of a sudden and be like, ‘Kristine, do you need ice?’ And I’m like, ‘Oh wow, dad, yeah I do need ice,” she said. “He’d just be, ‘Oh yeah, I figured it was busy enough.'” An employee delivers slices of cake to customers on The Danish Place’s last day of operations. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post The restaurant closed for two months after Christmas 2019, since January and February were historically slow. It reopened in March and they had two decent weeks before the economic lockdown orders came in because of COVID-19. “We took out our first loan the first week,” Mathers said. “We’re slowly watching that loan go down and absolutely no money come in.” Through the spring, the restaurant crept further into debt. The siblings opted to take the federal government’s interest-free $40,000 loan. They applied for the federal wage subsidy program, too.

Article content continued Still, by the time the restaurant reopened in July, the owners said it was roughly $70,000 in debt. “We racked it up pretty quick,” said Moyes, who manages the books. “We basically have carried seven months of debt of just running this business with no money coming in.” Plates of food awaiting delivery to customers at The Danish Place. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post They tried to run leaner. They reduced employee hours. They tried offering takeout, but few customers were willing to make the long drive to the restaurant. They cut the expensive items from the menu — steaks, shrimp, scallops, eels — so they didn’t lose as much when inventory rotted. “The only way a restaurant makes money is if they run at full capacity and you can turn and turn and turn your tables,” Moyes said. “It’s a ghost town. How can you make anywhere close to the money that you need?” It’s a ghost town. How can you make anywhere close to the money that you need? Joanne Moyes After restrictions eased in the summer, they were able to use 36 of the 120 possible seats inside and 20 seats on the patio. Moyes said sales were down by 75 per cent from the previous summer, hit especially hard by the disappearance of big catering events. The restaurant managed a profit in just a single month this year, making $2,000 in September. “We’ve incurred a substantial amount of personal debt to try to make it through,” Moyes said. “Where’s the money going to come from? The next step is to sell our homes.” *** The hard truth for the restaurant industry is that this summer’s bustling patio season gave the illusion of success. Even with full patios, most restaurants were only breaking even at best, because they were still well below normal capacity but saddled with the same costs.

Article content continued A recent forecast by trade association Restaurants Canada suggested that hospitality sales will not rebound to pre-pandemic levels until 2022. Chris Elliott, a senior economist at Restaurants Canada, said the best gauge on closures so far is Statistics Canada’s bi-annual business register, the latest instalment of which doesn’t come out until next month. The darkest days of this pandemic are ahead of us, not behind us Andrew Oliver, chief executive, Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality Inc. But by consulting with major restaurant suppliers, Elliott said the best estimate is that more than 10,000 had already shut down as of August, or roughly 10 per cent of the 98,000 restaurants, bars and caterers that were operating before the pandemic. That number is likely much higher today and will be even higher tomorrow. “The darkest days of this pandemic are ahead of us, not behind us,” said Andrew Oliver, chief executive at Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality Inc. and one of the most outspoken industry advocates and critics of the federal government’s small-business subsidies. “Now you have a situation where strong guys are going to fail.” Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants President and CEO Andrew Oliver at Canoe in Toronto in February. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post files After nine months of major sales declines, many restaurants are limping into winter without any savings left and no one is willing to lend them any more money, said Oliver, whose restaurant empire includes Canoe, the famed Bay Street haunt in Toronto. “No bank is going to sit there and say, ‘Hey, we’ll just lend to you until the government lets you open,’” he said. “If you’re going to borrow money or invest money in your business, you’re selling your house, you’re selling your assets, you’re selling your car, you’re selling whatever you’ve got to sell.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Some restaurants, however, are trying to hang on. At Roux Bistro & Bar, in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood, chef and owner Derrick Markland figures he needs to make roughly $550 a night to cover his costs. But with no more patio traffic and indoor dining banned in Toronto until restrictions lift, he isn’t making that. “Last night was basically maybe three orders,” he said in mid-October. “I can’t take on the loss forever. I know that. I’ve got my wife telling me, ‘Listen, you’ve got to shut this thing down.’ But at the same time, I have this overwhelming idea that it’s going to get better soon and it’s going to work out.'” Roux Bistro and Bar owner Derrick Markland at his restaurant in Toronto. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Markland, 58, started as a chef in Toronto in the 1980s. He worked at a few major hotels, then switched to running big catering operations. Nearing the end of his career, he wanted his own little restaurant. “That’s the emotional attachment. I worked for a long time in the restaurant business. This is what I wanted as a final goal for my career,” he said. “It’s hard to explain that to other people who say, why don’t you close that down? Well, it’s not that easy. It’s hard to say why … maybe I don’t want to go work for someone else at this age.” Even if he was willing to work for another restaurant, he worries it would be tough to find work in the struggling industry as an older executive chef. “I’m holding onto what I have, even though I know what I have isn’t making me any money at the moment,” he said. “It’s going to take me at least two, two-and-a-half years, with the amount of debt I have, to catch up.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued *** In the middle of October, Jacob Beck, Joanne Moyes and Kristine Mathers were at the bar in the Danish Place looking at their reservation book for the weekend. It was grim. “There might have been less than 10 reservations,” he said. “And a lot of those actually cancelled, because people were being encouraged to stay home and not go out.” The Danish Place was not in one of Ontario’s designated COVID-19 hot spots, so it didn’t have to shut down indoor dining in October like restaurants in Toronto, Ottawa, and Peel and York regions did. But elevated public health concerns, as the province lurched into a second wave of infections, kept customers away. “We came to the point where we’re not willing to give up our homes in order to sustain this business,” Moyes said. Their landlord, the not-for-profit Sunset Villa Association, had stepped in and raised $138,000 through a GoFundMe campaign in the summer. Anna Lewis, left, works on an order with an employee during the restaurant’s last day. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post They came to an agreement that the club would dole out chunks of the money to help prop up the restaurant through the pandemic. If the restaurant couldn’t last, the payments would essentially amount to the club buying the business. By October, the club had paid out $97,500 to the restaurant and it still was struggling to break even. The partners couldn’t see a way out. They worried they would burn through the club’s money and be right back in the same place: struggling along with a few customers and piling up more personal debt. “We didn’t want to leave the club in a lurch,” Beck said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Instead, they decided to break their lease. As per the agreement, the club bought the restaurant’s name and furnishings for $1, and took over its lease on the kitchen equipment. Next, they had to tell their parents. Mathers said the phone call was simple. Her parents knew it was coming. Anna Lewis, left, Benny Beck, right, and their daughter Kristine, centre, at the family’s restaurant in 2000. Photo by Courtesy of Kristine Mathers “My dad magically knew that I needed ice. He also knows, just by looking, what’s happening,” she said. “They’re very seasoned at this.” The owners announced their decision and were flooded with reservations in their restaurant’s final two weeks. Mathers didn’t have much time to think deeply on what was happening, to be 38 years old and starting over, walking away with her one-third share of the restaurant’s total debt. “I’ve worked there for more than half my life now,” she said. “I’m pretty terrified.” The calls kept coming in the final week. By lunch on Nov. 1, the final service, the kitchen was running out of ingredients. Mathers was crossing items off the paper menus: no more liver pate sandwiches, no more lemon mousse, no more Carlsberg tall cans. I’ve worked there for more than half my life now. I'm pretty terrified Kristine Mathers They weren’t taking credit or debit, because they didn’t want to pay the bank for a whole month of the service, and the ATM was down, so they took e-transfers. Benny Beck was out buying more bread and Anna was in the kitchen, standing over plates of open-faced sandwiches. “Who has three hands?” she called out to a group of servers. Jacob Beck, who took over the kitchen when his parents retired, made a point of leaving his post to walk around the dining room.

She lit two cigarettes and passed one to Benny, then she picked up his coffee cup and sipped it. “Now, when we’re not so busy anymore, it hits,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking, not so much for ourselves, but the kids.” Benny started to tremble. “What do you do?” he said.

Canadian households are spending a disproportionate share of emergency support money on imported consumer goods, meaning government efforts aren’t as effective as they could be, Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC, said in a report published Tuesday. More than 50 per cent of every dollar spent on clothes, for example, goes to pay suppliers abroad, compared with services such as haircuts, where most of the money goes toward paying staff and fixed costs like rent, the economist said.

Article content continued If nothing is done to fix the leakage, governments may have to spend more on fiscal support than other larger or less-open economies, Mendes said. Canada has already spent the most in the Group of 20 on its pandemic response relative to the size of its economy, yet employment and gross domestic product outcomes have been similar to those in countries such as the U.S., according to CIBC. More On This Topic Canadian economy hangs in the balance as U.S. elections affect stimulus plans Canada expands path to citizenship for foreigners in bid to stem immigration drop The only thing Canadians are optimistic about right now is the housing market Canada’s economic recovery heading towards an uncertain future after a sunny summer In July, the Canadian government estimated its budget deficit would soar to $343 billion (US$264 billion) this year, or 16 per cent of total output, mostly on support for workers and businesses affected by COVID-19. It has since announced an additional $40 billion in spending. “Now, it’s true that Canada’s dollars have translated into far fewer COVID-related deaths as a proportion of the population than the next five biggest spenders on the list,” Mendes wrote. “But it’s also likely that part of the reason Canada has had to spend so much is because of the leakages we’ve discussed.” Governments have some options to plug the leaks, Mendes says, such as ramping up the availability of rapid COVID-19 testing to make Canadians feel safe so they can support service-oriented firms. Other possibilities include cutting the sales tax on services or directly subsidizing indoor dining, patios or take-out food, depending on the state of local health restrictions, he said. Although these will be costly measures up front for the government, doing nothing could ultimately cost more. “If these programs work, we might have to spend less money on propping up businesses and individuals employed in that sector,” Mendes said by phone.

Holidays in lockdown: Restaurateurs and shopkeepers face an impossible situation Back to video Restaurants and retailers have relied on that holiday rush to make it through the rest of the winter, when sales dip to their lowest. But after more than 10 months of limping through evolving pandemic safety restrictions on indoor gatherings, this holiday season is shaping up to be historically slow for many businesses as new lockdown orders take hold in places such as Toronto and neighbouring Peel region.

Article content continued “We’re not going to have any fuel going forward in cash flow for January and February,” Paramount’s chief executive Mohamad Fakih said. “Every restaurant company has thrown profit out of the window since the beginning of the pandemic. All that they’re trying to do is to keep up with their bills, without any entrepreneur or franchisee taking a penny home.” Small-business advocates are warning that the retail and restaurant sectors could be looking at a wave of mass closures without a solid holiday shopping season or an additional influx of government aid. “This is really a do-or-die moment for many in the retail sector and, of course, in the hospitality sector,” said Alla Drigola, director of parliamentary affairs at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We’re heading into what should be typically the busiest time of the year for retailers, particularly small and medium-size ones. And with the lockdowns that they’re facing across the country, many are actually looking at permanent closures.” Drigola echoed concerns voiced by several industry insiders on Monday about the ability of big-box retailers to remain open, because they sell groceries, even though they also sell clothes, electronics and other common gift items, while small businesses are forced to close. Unused restaurant chairs show what lockdowns are doing to the industry.

We could be looking at mass layoffs,” Drigola said. Restaurants Canada, a major trade association for the hospitality sector, said the expected lost holiday revenues is not the only blow to restaurant operators across the country. Todd Barclay, the association’s chief executive, said restaurateurs have already invested thousands of dollars in Plexiglass shields and heated outdoor patios to stay operating through the holiday season. “It’s not just the dollars that we’re missing out on … it’s the dollars that have been spent in order to keep people safe,” he said. “This is when you fill up the coffers in order to survive through the bleakest times in January and February.” Stop saying restaurants are a problem when you don’t have data to support that Todd Barclay, Restaurants Canada Barclay also said the rapid fluctuation in dining restrictions have proven costly for restaurants. For example, Ontario’s most recent lockdown announcement for Toronto and Peel came on Friday and went into effect on Monday. Stocking a kitchen, he said, can cost anywhere between $5,000 and $30,000, depending on the size of the restaurant. “Imagine being told on a Friday, after you’ve filled up your fridge and freezer with food, that 90 per cent of your business is going to go away in 12 to 48 hours,” he said. “We want to be part of the solution. However, this on-again, off-again is just devastating. Barclay said the industry doesn’t want to do anything that is considered unsafe, but would like to be part of any decisions that directly impact it.

Article content continued “And stop saying that restaurants are a problem when you don’t have data to support that,” he added. At Paramount Fine Foods, 17 of its 69 Canadian locations are in Toronto and Peel region, but Fakih said his business is roughly comparable to last year’s revenues due to added sales from two takeout brands — one for fried chicken, one for pizza — that the company launched using some of its existing kitchens as a way of tapping into new consumption habits. Still, the pandemic is continuing to drive down sales, particularly in urban areas. “Paramount has locations outside the lockdown area, and those locations are doing better,” he said. “Downtown is gone. You keep hearing every day about locations that are closing in downtown Toronto.” For example, the Paramount Fine Foods outlet at Toronto’s once-bustling Union Station was hitting roughly $8,000 in sales each day before the pandemic. Now, it’s close to nothing. “We’re doing $300 a day,” Fakih said.

Article content Canadian consumers are likely to end up forking out more for U.S. streaming services such as Netflix and short-term rentals on Airbnb once a new federal regime forcing tech platforms to charge sales tax comes into effect, but it isn’t clear that the new taxes will have a significant impact on consumption patterns, industry watchers say. Ottawa’s fall economic statement Monday proposed the new “fair taxation” of cross-border digital products and services regime, which is to come into force on in July 2021. The government said the current tax regime, under which these players don’t collect and remit the goods and services tax (GST) or harmonize sales tax (HST), has given “foreign-based digital corporations an unfair advantage, and undercuts the competitiveness of Canadian companies.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Taxing Airbnb and Netflix may level the playing field, but it won't likely change consumer habits Back to video Some, like the hotel industry, say the government’s proposed tax changes will level the playing field. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “This is about fairness,” said Alana Baker, spokesperson for the Canadian Hotel Association. “Canadian hotel operators pay corporate income tax and must charge and remit HST at the point of sale, but digital players today get a tax holiday,” Baker said. Still, industry watchers don’t expect much to change in the way of consumer behavior, particularly when it comes to streaming services. Kaan Yigit, president of Solutions Research Group, said he doesn’t think sales tax on Netflix will send any customers running to domestic video streaming services like Bell Media’s Crave, which already charges GST. “Netflix has a well-defined value proposition, a very extensive and growing library, and is extremely well regarded by Canadian subscribers, with a very high 88 per cent ‘likely to recommend’ score,” he said. “Tax on it will not result in subscriber losses or churn.” Netflix already collects and remits sales tax in two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Saskatchewan, and a spokesperson said the streaming service “will work collaboratively with the federal government on this issue, as (the company has done) previously in Quebec and Saskatchewan.” She declined to comment on whether the amount of the tax top-up, if imposed in other provinces as expected, would be borne by consumers or whether the cost of the service would drop to accommodate it. A spokesperson for the Canadian Association of Broadcasters declined to comment on the planned tax changes and how they are expected to affect the competitive landscape with foreign players such as Netflix and Spotify. However, he said the real win for traditional broadcasters in the government’s economic roadmap came in the form of a licensing fee waiver that is expected to provide “up to $50 million in relief” to help them stay afloat and continue providing broadcast services across the country.

Article content continued “Given the profound structural challenges faced by the sector, and the economic impact of COVID-19 on their businesses, this waiver will allow many private broadcasters to persevere through the tough year ahead,” said Kevin Desjardins, president of the CAB. The fall economic statement also set a timeline for another less-defined tax that is to apply to foreign-owned digital platforms beginning in 2022. Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, suggested that if that takes the form of a government tax on revenue it is likely to be far more controversial than the GST or harmonized sales tax, which would simply be collected from Canadian consumers and remitted to the Canadian government. He said Canada appears to be moving “in the same direction” as countries such as France, which faced retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. after attempting to extract tax from the tech giants. “Those taxes will have an impact on U.S. tax revenues, so we can expect a response,” said Geist, who is also the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law. Charlie Urbancic, a spokesperson from Airbnb Inc., said the company is reviewing Ottawa’s planned tax regime changes and looks forward to “engaging in consultation on that matter.” He declined to comment further on how the new taxes would affect the online marketplace for short-term accommodations in Canada. • Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPost Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Taxing Airbnb and Netflix may level the playing field, but it won't likely change consumer habits Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Top Stories Newsletter Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.” Facebook has squashed or hindered what the company saw as potential threats, said New York Attorney General Letitia James during an online press conference. Facebook used “vast amounts of money” to acquire companies that could potentially threaten it’s dominance, particularly Instagram and WhatsApp, she said. The effort was meant to “squeeze every bit of oxygen out of the room.” Facebook’s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition Ian Conner, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition Facebook became a prime target for President Donald Trump in the last two months of his administration. Last week, he threatened to veto the annual U.S. defence authorization bill unless Congress adds a rider to abolish the law that protects technology companies, including Facebook, from liability over most content posted by users. The demand followed months of attacks by Trump and other Republicans, who claim the technology platforms suppress conservative views. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Facebook and its tech peers are facing a groundswell of bipartisan antagonism over their control of digital commerce and their ability to influence what users watch and read. The investigations into the companies began in the summer of 2019 after the FTC and the Justice Department agreed on a plan to divide up scrutiny of Facebook, Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. A House report released in October following a 16-month investigation determined the four companies are abusing their market power as gatekeepers over the digital economy. It will be up to Biden’s Justice Department to carry the Google case forward, while the Facebook case will fall to whomever Biden picks as FTC chairman if Joe Simons, who was appointed by Trump, leaves the agency. Simons, a Republican, voted with the agency’s two Democrats to approve the Facebook complaint. Facebook said on Twitter that the company was reviewing the complaints. It pointed out that the FTC investigated and approved the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp when they were proposed. “Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day,” it said. Facebook offered US$1 billion for Instagram in 2012. Photo by Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files Facebook offered US$1 billion for Instagram in 2012 when it had only 25 million users and no revenue, but had already started to capture the market for mobile photo-sharing. Facebook “quickly recognized that Instagram was a vibrant and innovative personal social network and an existential threat to Facebook’s monopoly power,” the FTC says. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The deal “would not only squelch the direct threat that Instagram posed, but also significantly hinder another firm from using photo-sharing on mobile phones to gain popularity as a provider of personal social networking.” The company repeated the anti-competitive exercise when acquiring WhatsApp, the mobile messaging leader, in 2014 for US$19 billion, according to the agency. Employees saw direct messaging apps as a threat to social media companies, especially if they started to create their own competing features. In a 2012 email, Zuckerberg said messaging apps could be used “as a springboard to build more general mobile social networks.” WhatsApp’s position as a global service without ties or restrictions to work with any single platform made it an attractive acquisition, the FTC found. “Once again, Facebook decided it was better to buy than compete,” the FTC said. “After Facebook announced the acquisition of WhatsApp, employees internally celebrated the acquisition of ‘probably the only company which could have grown into the next FB purely on mobile[.]’” Facebook acquired WhatsApp, the mobile messaging leader, in 2014 for US$19 billion. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters files WhatsApp, unlike Instagram, does not contribute meaningful revenue to Facebook today, but the company is setting the stage to turn the messaging app into a commerce and payments service in key international markets, including India and Brazil. In recent years, Facebook has been combining the WhatsApp and Instagram networks with its own, strengthening its power over global communication and making any future breakup more technically difficult.

Article content continued The lawsuits also accuse Facebook of thwarting competition in violation of antitrust laws by preventing apps that were seen as competitive threats from accessing its platform. The House committee that investigated Facebook and the other tech companies said Facebook “weaponized” its platform against rivals by preventing them from getting access to the data they needed to grow. According to the FTC, Facebook allowed third-party developers to connect to the platform only on condition that they didn’t build competing functionalities, and connecting with or promoting other social networking services. “The two most utilized strategies have been to acquire smaller rivals and potential rivals before they could threaten Facebook’s dominance and to suffocate and squash third-party developers that Facebook invited to utilize its platform,” James’s office said in a statement. Facebook has long denied it’s a threat to competition. Zuckerberg told Congress in July that the company faces intense competition around the world and is constantly innovating to develop products users will like and to avoid falling behind. Instagram’s success was far from guaranteed, he told lawmakers. It was Facebook’s investments in the company that made it successful, he said. “With hindsight it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,” he told Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee. “This has been an American success story.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Last year, Simons reached a US$5-billion settlement with Facebook for privacy infractions, an agreement that was widely criticized by privacy advocates, Democratic lawmakers and the agency’s two Democratic commissioners for not securing changes in the way Facebook operates. The FTC is taking on Facebook just as it’s coming off a stinging loss in a monopoly case brought against Qualcomm Inc.

In this series, the Financial Post explores the opportunities and unknown costs of the Great Rethink. Canadians have been tossing cash into Salvation Army kettles at Christmastime since 1903, long enough to become part of the holiday tradition. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The Great Rethink: Cash is no longer king and the transition is going to be a high-stakes affair Back to video “People are familiar with the idea of giving your child a loonie or a toonie or a dollar bill, depending on how old you are, and having them drop it in the bubble,” spokesperson Rob Kerr said. The experience will feel less familiar in 2020. The Salvation Army in November announced that its annual kettle fundraising campaign in Ontario would be “proactively taking a digital turn” by switching to a mostly online fundraising effort, via FilltheKettle.com, in COVID-19 hot spots. On Dec. 14, the Sally Ann said Christmas kettles would also be absent from Manitoba’s street corners and shopping malls due to the pandemic and the provincial government’s related restrictions.

Article content continued In another sign of the times, the charity on Dec. 1 said that hundreds of kettles were being equipped with “touchless giving technology,” provided by Canadian startup TipTapPay Micropayments Ltd. and powered by Rogers Communications Inc.’s wireless network, to allow donations via a credit card or smartphone. “This is the year when a lot of our traditions are shifting,” Kerr said in an interview on Nov. 24. The adjustments were necessary to protect volunteers from a highly contagious and deadly disease. But the Salvation Army, one of the country’s oldest charities, is now also one of a growing number of entities coming to grips with a simple fact: people are using cash much less often to pay for things, and that trend has all sorts of ramifications for central banks and society at large.

Photo by Ian Kucerak/Postmedia News The move to a cash-lite society has been happening for a while. Payments Canada, the non-profit that owns and operates this country’s payment clearing and settlement systems, found that the number of overall payment transactions by cash declined to 18.4 per cent in 2019 from 32.8 per cent in 2014. COVID-19 appears to have accelerated the trend. Some grew fearful of handling cash amid reports that it could be a conduit for the virus, but there has also been a shift to e-commerce fuelled by the forced closure of brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales by traditional retailers increased more than 74 per cent from a year earlier in September, according to Statistics Canada. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued It has all prompted some existential thinking about the future of money. Metal circles and paper bills with animals and monarchs stamped all over them are being hoarded, not spent, according to Bank of Canada data. In addition to cash and cards, consumers can now make payments using a variety of apps or “wearables,” such as smart watches. In some cases they are even experimenting with digital currencies. This trend may be creating a lot of convenience for consumers, but policy-makers see cash as a public good and, therefore, feel duty bound to ensure it (or, perhaps, something like it) is there for people to use. More On This Topic Digital cash may seem inevitable, but the Bank of Canada isn’t quite ready to concede Christine Lagarde says her ‘hunch’ is that ECB will adopt digital currency Bank of Canada says digital currencies need globally coordinated approach Pandemic accelerates need to consider digital currency: Bank of Canada Adding to that concern are the digital currencies being developed by both the private and public sectors, as widespread support by citizens for something other than the national currency could challenge a country’s control over its monetary affairs. Any of these factors would have been enough to get the attention of authorities. With all of them converging at once, Canadian central bankers and their allies abroad have been forced to speed up plans for digital currencies of their own, if only to ensure the groundwork is in place should the need to issue such a currency arise. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued If cash is no longer king, policymakers are at least thinking about the line of succession. “This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving,” Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane said during a virtual panel discussion in October. “And, particularly, I think with COVID we’ve seen an acceleration of the shift of activities online, and that suggests that if we want to be ready to develop any kind of digital central bank product, we need to move faster than we thought was going to be necessary.” This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane Yet any tweak to money as we know it is bound to be a high-stakes proposition. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. You don’t need a smartphone to hand someone a cash payment. Physical currency also offers privacy, something authorities in democratic countries say they want to protect, even if it keeps some of them up at night over concerns such as money laundering. Still, cash was in decline even before the pandemic. As electronic and contactless payments have surged, the combined monetary value of cash transactions shrank to 0.9 per cent of total transactions in 2019, from 1.4 per cent in 2014, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. Photo by Francis Racine/Cornwall Standard-Freeholder/Postmedia Network files “What we are starting to see is extensions of trends that have already occurred,” Tracey Black, chief executive of Payments Canada, said. The trend away from cash has likely gained further momentum during the pandemic, partly because a number of people have likely come to see bills and coins as virus carriers. Payments Canada in a recent survey found that 42 per cent of Canadians polled were uncomfortable handling cash in general. Even post-pandemic, approximately 34 per cent of those surveyed did not expect to return to using cash as much as they did pre-COVID-19. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Bank of Canada urged retailers in the earlier days of the pandemic to keep accepting cash to ensure everyone could buy what they need. More recently, Bank of England research found that the risk of transmitting COVID-19 via banknotes is low. However, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report that fewer than five per cent of Canadians have used a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, to make a recent purchase. This is partly why the Bank of Canada in February said it saw no reason yet to create digital cash, although it also said it still had to be ready to do so just in case. Those statements came after Facebook Inc. created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra, which was recently rebranded as Diem. Members of the Diem Association — which still aims to launch a payment system with “Diem Coins” backed by cash and short-term government debt — include Ottawa-based Shopify Inc. and Spotify Technology SA. Facebook created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters Illustration files The Libra announcement caught the attention of policy-makers, who pushed back against the original vision, hence the recent rebrand and tweaks to the overall vision. Still, one of the concerns was that if enough people used something like a Libra/Diem “stablecoin,” it could sideline monetary gatekeepers such as the Bank of Canada. If too many Canadians conduct their financial affairs in a currency other than the dollar, they won’t much care about the setting of interest rates, making it harder for the central bank to manage inflation. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued This sort of concern, as well as innovation and the proliferation of digital payment options, has central banks thinking about their own central bank digital currency (CBDC). A survey of 66 central banks published earlier this year found approximately 80 per cent of them were doing some kind of CBDC-related work as of 2019, up from around 70 per cent a year earlier. The digital cash these banks could ultimately issue would not replace physical cash entirely, but might instead be accepted alongside it, as another form of payment backed by the government. CBDC, Payments Canada explained in another recent report, “is a digital liability of the central bank” that can be used to pay for things. In other words, similar to cash. The Bank of Canada would be on the hook for its digital currency, which citizens could use to spend on things the same way they would with bank notes. Issuing a CBDC could also “potentially counter” a threat such as Libra, Bank of Canada staffers said back in February. Some countries have already taken the CBDC concept for a test drive. Sweden’s central bank has piloted an “e-krona,” the Bahamas has launched a digital “Sand Dollar” and China is readying a central-bank-backed virtual currency of its own. In February, the Bank of Canada signalled it was working on a contingency plan for the day it might need a digital currency in the event that cash stopped being widely accepted or private digital currencies became all the rage. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued COVID-19 has hastened that planning. In November, now-former Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank had “stepped up our work on central bank digital currency, given that COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital payments.” The Bank of Canada also joined with the European, Japanese, Swedish, Swiss, English and U.S. central banks in October in publishing “common foundational principles and core features” of CBDCs. According to those guidelines, issuing a digital currency shouldn’t upend the financial system, such as by causing a bank run if people pull their money from commercial lenders and put it into virtual cash. The central banks also said a digital currency should “coexist with and complement existing forms of money,” and spark innovation and efficiency. A conveyer belt with objects is used to demonstrate blockchain technology. Photo by David Becker/Getty Images files Central bankers identified 14 core features of any CBDC, including that it should be as easy to use as cash. There would also need to be a ledger to keep track of things, which could look similar to the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin. The central banks also see potential for digital currencies to be used in ways beyond everyday payments, such as when governments need to speedily send funds to citizens in need, as they have during the pandemic. The Bank of Canada back in February touched on a few other reasons as to why a digital currency would be helpful. For one, if everyone started using a digital currency created by a private company, a lender of last resort such as the Bank of Canada can’t start cranking out that currency to bail out commercial financial institutions in a crisis. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Moreover, having a private company in charge of a widely used currency could go against the public’s interest, since that company would naturally be guided by a profit motive, not necessarily what’s best for society at large. The Bank of Canada maintains that it has an obligation to ensure that every Canadian has access to a unit of exchange they can use for free. That’s one of the reasons policy-makers are so protective of cash. But the main reason a central bank would issue a digital currency is probably control, specifically, the fear of losing control of monetary matters to a company or another country. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value by setting interest rates in a way that keeps prices stable. The monetary sovereignty of a country could be jeopardized if a company or another country’s digital currency gained enough traction. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value. Photo by Brent Lewin/Bloomberg files “A risk of stablecoins, so-called ‘cryptocurrencies’ and foreign CBDCs is that domestic users adopt them in significant numbers and use of the domestic sovereign currency dwindles,” the October report from the Bank of Canada and other central banks said. “In extremis, such a ‘digital dollarisation’ could see a national currency substituted by another with the domestic central bank gradually losing control over monetary matters.” That risk could be compounded depending on who is providing the hot new currency. China, noted Barry Campbell, a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance, has aimed to increase the global importance of its currency. Being a digital currency trailblazer could help those efforts. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “It’s actually a geopolitical issue, it’s not just an issue over dollars and cents,” said Campbell, now president of Toronto-based lobbying firm Campbell Strategies Inc., of CBDCs. “This working group of the central banks … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf.” Perhaps with this in mind, Bank of Canada staffers said in a June report that the central bank was looking at “multiple formats” for a digital currency, including the use of a “custom device that is engineered for universal access while securely storing and transferring a CBDC.” These universal access devices (UAD) “could incorporate attributes of cash and take advantage of specialized technologies,” the report said. Those cash-like features could include making it wallet-sized and allowing for small transactions. This working group … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf Barry Campbell, former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance “They have to be ready in case the necessity arises that they have to provide a digital alternative to cash,” said Thorsten Koeppl, an economics professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont. Yet the death of cash is likely years away, if it ever actually happens. In April, for instance, Bank of Canada staffers, working with Ipsos and Statistics Canada, found that 74 per cent of the people they surveyed had no plans to go cashless. “I think inclusion is something that we really have to continue to monitor, and to make sure that there’s always an opportunity for people who prefer to use cash as tender to be able to purchase the things that they need,” Black, at Payments Canada, said. “I think cash is going to be around for quite some time.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued A digital Canadian currency is likely some ways off as well, even as Payments Canada modernizes its systems and the federal government examines the concept of open banking, which could allow consumers to securely share transaction data with third-party financial service providers. The Bank of Canada in February noted that it will take “several years” to build the capacity to issue a cash-like CBDC, in addition to support from the federal government. The bank also noted that there are other ways to respond to a cashless economy or a boom in private digital currencies, including targeted regulation and improved payment systems, both of which are in the works.

Photo by Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images files A Canadian CBDC is not a sure thing and policy-makers at this point are really just getting cash’s affairs in order. In the meantime, there are still plenty of people relying on it. Kerr at the Salvation Army said the majority of donations had been coming in the form of cash tossed into the bubbles placed in and around places where people shop. Those bills and coins help fund the food banks, shelters and substance-use recovery programs the charity operates. This year’s Christmas kettle campaign was targeting $23 million in donations. Hitting that amount in a normal year would have taken plenty of work and generosity, even before factoring in declining cash use and the coronavirus pandemic. But the “touchless giving units” are expected to help. According to Tiptap, a pilot of the devices on Salvation Army kettles last year in Toronto led to three times the donation amounts at those bubbles compared to cash-only ones. “It is,” Kerr said, “a new day.” Financial Post • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: The Great Rethink: Cash is no longer king and the transition is going to be a high-stakes affair Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Fear of coronavirus-tainted money grows in U.S., opening new front in the war on cash Back to video And across the financial industry, a rigorous debate is brewing over how to address the public’s mounting concern that greenbacks might transmit COVID-19. Studies show it’s at least theoretically possible for other coronaviruses to survive on the dollar’s cotton-and-linen weave, though there’s little agreement on the actual risk of contagion.

Article content continued Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there’s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it’s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it’s safe. The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue. On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it’s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low — comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail. ‘Hygienic’ Payments If, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry’s long-running “war on cash,” sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Visa and Mastercard credit cards. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg files The virus may end up serving as a “trigger event” for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said. “Digital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,” she said. “This is another reason: ‘Oh, and it’s hygienic too.'” Fighting for Poor And on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going “cashless.” Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted. Some of those groups worry they’re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus. “Going cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,” said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. “We certainly wouldn’t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you’re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Despite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10. Cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked — with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open. “If you want to go that direction, it’s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,” John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. “There’s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.” Paper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects. One study in 2013 showed the dollar has the ability to show “significant and prolonged carriage” of the dreaded Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria known as MSRA.

So far during the current outbreak, the Fed hasn’t widely enacted its longstanding protocol for banks handling bills suspected of being dangerous: First stacking them in “straps” of 100, then bundling those into larger bricks and packaging them in plastic bags with the word “CONTAMINATED” scribbled in permanent ink. Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world’s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector. “In the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat said in an interview. “People are just not traveling internationally and this is one of the most profitable businesses that these companies have.” Bloomberg.com Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Fear of coronavirus-tainted money grows in U.S., opening new front in the war on cash Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

A few years ago, Biden was waylaid by a BBC correspondent who requested “a quick word for the BBC,” to which Biden responded with a smile and said: “The BBC? I’m Irish.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Diane Francis: The Disunited Kingdom Back to video Biden, like millions of others including myself, had ancestors who were driven out of Ireland during the potato famine, which was exacerbated by the British government. This does not mean there is acrimony toward Britain, but it does mean that any notion of a “special relationship” is anachronistic. Biden has never supported Brexit and made it clear that the sticky dispute between the European Union and the United Kingdom concerning the north-south Irish border must be resolved in favour of what the Irish desire. And last year, Biden described British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump,” in private remarks that were widely reported by the British press.

The ‘great rerun of stupid handouts’ is Now Britain has only 17 days to kowtow to Europe’s wishes. Regardless of what happens, the country will face difficulties that could tear the kingdom apart. Brexit will go down as one of the biggest mistakes in British history and recent polls show that 70 per cent of Britons agree. The country has already lost manufacturing, head offices and research opportunities during the lead-up to the departure. What’s astonishing is that there was no strategy in place then, or even now, as to how the country will retain its living standards. Johnson recently crowed that Brexit will bring liberation and transformation to the country. He has characterized Britain’s membership in the EU as constraining and said in a speech that the U.K. will now fly like Superman “as a supercharged champion” that’s able to chart its own path. But in reality, Britain is adrift. There is no empire and any effort to forge a free trade agreement with the United States or China would be a non-starter. In fact, China’s takeover of Hong Kong, in defiance of pledges it made to the U.K., has broken that notion and, at the same time, is proof of Britain’s diminished significance. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Photo by Simon Dawson/Reuters The idea of Britain becoming a free-trade, low-regulatory “Singapore on the Thames” is laughable. Europe will not allow the U.K. to undermine its rules, and the country’s structural flaws — a poor work ethic plus large income and educational disparities — will be exacerbated by going it alone. Most significantly, the electorates in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly against Brexit. Scotland has been disaffected for generations and the Protestant population of Northern Ireland has declined, leaving a cohort that favours reuniting with the successful Irish republic. Both could be viable countries. In 2018, England’s gross domestic product was £1.8 trillion ($3.07 trillion), while Scotland’s was only £161.29 billion and Northern Ireland’s was £48.89 billion. But an independent Scotland would be economically bigger than Hungary, and a free Northern Ireland would be the size of Luxembourg or Lithuania. The most viable country would be a united Republic of Ireland. The south has a GDP of £399 billion and, joined with Northern Ireland, would be economically as big as Belgium or Austria. Add Scotland into a “republic of Celts” and the three would be bigger than Poland. Secession is not a fantasy, unlike Johnson’s “Superman” metaphor. In the real world of competing interests and geopolitical alliances, an untethered Great Britain without a trade bloc, prosperity or an empire is a ship of state that, unfortunately, is steaming toward the shoals.

Facebook sued by U.S. states seeking Instagram, WhatsApp breakup Back to video The case represents the biggest regulatory attack against Facebook in the company’s history. It follows the Justice Department’s October lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Together, the Google and Facebook actions mark the most significant monopoly cases filed in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.

Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.” Facebook has squashed or hindered what the company saw as potential threats, said New York Attorney General Letitia James during an online press conference. Facebook used “vast amounts of money” to acquire companies that could potentially threaten it’s dominance, particularly Instagram and WhatsApp, she said. The effort was meant to “squeeze every bit of oxygen out of the room.” Facebook’s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition Ian Conner, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition Facebook became a prime target for President Donald Trump in the last two months of his administration. Last week, he threatened to veto the annual U.S. defence authorization bill unless Congress adds a rider to abolish the law that protects technology companies, including Facebook, from liability over most content posted by users. The demand followed months of attacks by Trump and other Republicans, who claim the technology platforms suppress conservative views.

Article content continued Facebook and its tech peers are facing a groundswell of bipartisan antagonism over their control of digital commerce and their ability to influence what users watch and read. The investigations into the companies began in the summer of 2019 after the FTC and the Justice Department agreed on a plan to divide up scrutiny of Facebook, Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. A House report released in October following a 16-month investigation determined the four companies are abusing their market power as gatekeepers over the digital economy. It will be up to Biden’s Justice Department to carry the Google case forward, while the Facebook case will fall to whomever Biden picks as FTC chairman if Joe Simons, who was appointed by Trump, leaves the agency. Simons, a Republican, voted with the agency’s two Democrats to approve the Facebook complaint. Facebook said on Twitter that the company was reviewing the complaints. It pointed out that the FTC investigated and approved the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp when they were proposed. “Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day,” it said. Facebook offered US$1 billion for Instagram in 2012. Photo by Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files Facebook offered US$1 billion for Instagram in 2012 when it had only 25 million users and no revenue, but had already started to capture the market for mobile photo-sharing. Facebook “quickly recognized that Instagram was a vibrant and innovative personal social network and an existential threat to Facebook’s monopoly power,” the FTC says. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The deal “would not only squelch the direct threat that Instagram posed, but also significantly hinder another firm from using photo-sharing on mobile phones to gain popularity as a provider of personal social networking.” The company repeated the anti-competitive exercise when acquiring WhatsApp, the mobile messaging leader, in 2014 for US$19 billion, according to the agency. Employees saw direct messaging apps as a threat to social media companies, especially if they started to create their own competing features. In a 2012 email, Zuckerberg said messaging apps could be used “as a springboard to build more general mobile social networks.” WhatsApp’s position as a global service without ties or restrictions to work with any single platform made it an attractive acquisition, the FTC found. “Once again, Facebook decided it was better to buy than compete,” the FTC said. “After Facebook announced the acquisition of WhatsApp, employees internally celebrated the acquisition of ‘probably the only company which could have grown into the next FB purely on mobile[.]’” Facebook acquired WhatsApp, the mobile messaging leader, in 2014 for US$19 billion. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters files WhatsApp, unlike Instagram, does not contribute meaningful revenue to Facebook today, but the company is setting the stage to turn the messaging app into a commerce and payments service in key international markets, including India and Brazil. In recent years, Facebook has been combining the WhatsApp and Instagram networks with its own, strengthening its power over global communication and making any future breakup more technically difficult.

Article content continued The lawsuits also accuse Facebook of thwarting competition in violation of antitrust laws by preventing apps that were seen as competitive threats from accessing its platform. The House committee that investigated Facebook and the other tech companies said Facebook “weaponized” its platform against rivals by preventing them from getting access to the data they needed to grow. According to the FTC, Facebook allowed third-party developers to connect to the platform only on condition that they didn’t build competing functionalities, and connecting with or promoting other social networking services. “The two most utilized strategies have been to acquire smaller rivals and potential rivals before they could threaten Facebook’s dominance and to suffocate and squash third-party developers that Facebook invited to utilize its platform,” James’s office said in a statement. Facebook has long denied it’s a threat to competition. Zuckerberg told Congress in July that the company faces intense competition around the world and is constantly innovating to develop products users will like and to avoid falling behind. Instagram’s success was far from guaranteed, he told lawmakers. It was Facebook’s investments in the company that made it successful, he said. “With hindsight it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,” he told Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee. “This has been an American success story.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued (Instagram) has been an American success story Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO The Facebook complaint is the most significant antitrust action under Simons’s tenure since he took over the agency in 2018. Last year, Simons reached a US$5-billion settlement with Facebook for privacy infractions, an agreement that was widely criticized by privacy advocates, Democratic lawmakers and the agency’s two Democratic commissioners for not securing changes in the way Facebook operates. The FTC is taking on Facebook just as it’s coming off a stinging loss in a monopoly case brought against Qualcomm Inc. A federal appeals court in August ruled in favour of the chipmaker and reversed a lower-court decision that the company abused its dominant position in the market for cellphone chips.

Canada to boost screening of UK travelers, sees no sign of mutated COVID-19 Back to video Although Ottawa imposed a 72-hour block on flights from Britain on Sunday, Blair said more steps were needed to handle people who had been in the country and then flown to Canada via Europe or the United States. Visitors to Britain during the previous two weeks prior to arrival in Canada will be referred to health officials for additional assessments, screening and questions. They will also have to go into quarantine for 14 days. “We believe (these measures) are among the strongest in the world,” Blair said, adding that those who lied about having not been in Britain could face imprisonment and big fines. Fewer than 2% of coronavirus cases in Canada have been linked to international travel, Blair said. A second wave of coronavirus is sweeping across Canada and authorities have only just begun to inoculate the population using Pfizer’s vaccine. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said a decision on whether to approve Moderna Inc’s vaccine should come very soon but gave no details. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Monday announced a partial shutdown of some businesses starting Dec. 26 and banned most indoor gatherings. Cases continue to rise steadily and chief public health officer Theresa Tam said she was particularly worried about the increasing number of people being hospitalized at a time when health care workers are exhausted. “It’s going to be much more difficult for us to manage in the next few months,” she said.

The Great Rethink: Cash is no longer king and the transition is going to be a high-stakes affair Back to video “People are familiar with the idea of giving your child a loonie or a toonie or a dollar bill, depending on how old you are, and having them drop it in the bubble,” spokesperson Rob Kerr said. The experience will feel less familiar in 2020. The Salvation Army in November announced that its annual kettle fundraising campaign in Ontario would be “proactively taking a digital turn” by switching to a mostly online fundraising effort, via FilltheKettle.com, in COVID-19 hot spots. On Dec. 14, the Sally Ann said Christmas kettles would also be absent from Manitoba’s street corners and shopping malls due to the pandemic and the provincial government’s related restrictions.

The adjustments were necessary to protect volunteers from a highly contagious and deadly disease. But the Salvation Army, one of the country’s oldest charities, is now also one of a growing number of entities coming to grips with a simple fact: people are using cash much less often to pay for things, and that trend has all sorts of ramifications for central banks and society at large.

Photo by Ian Kucerak/Postmedia News The move to a cash-lite society has been happening for a while. Payments Canada, the non-profit that owns and operates this country’s payment clearing and settlement systems, found that the number of overall payment transactions by cash declined to 18.4 per cent in 2019 from 32.8 per cent in 2014. COVID-19 appears to have accelerated the trend. Some grew fearful of handling cash amid reports that it could be a conduit for the virus, but there has also been a shift to e-commerce fuelled by the forced closure of brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales by traditional retailers increased more than 74 per cent from a year earlier in September, according to Statistics Canada. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued It has all prompted some existential thinking about the future of money. Metal circles and paper bills with animals and monarchs stamped all over them are being hoarded, not spent, according to Bank of Canada data. In addition to cash and cards, consumers can now make payments using a variety of apps or “wearables,” such as smart watches. In some cases they are even experimenting with digital currencies. This trend may be creating a lot of convenience for consumers, but policy-makers see cash as a public good and, therefore, feel duty bound to ensure it (or, perhaps, something like it) is there for people to use. More On This Topic Digital cash may seem inevitable, but the Bank of Canada isn’t quite ready to concede Christine Lagarde says her ‘hunch’ is that ECB will adopt digital currency Bank of Canada says digital currencies need globally coordinated approach Pandemic accelerates need to consider digital currency: Bank of Canada Adding to that concern are the digital currencies being developed by both the private and public sectors, as widespread support by citizens for something other than the national currency could challenge a country’s control over its monetary affairs. Any of these factors would have been enough to get the attention of authorities. With all of them converging at once, Canadian central bankers and their allies abroad have been forced to speed up plans for digital currencies of their own, if only to ensure the groundwork is in place should the need to issue such a currency arise.

Article content continued If cash is no longer king, policymakers are at least thinking about the line of succession. “This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving,” Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane said during a virtual panel discussion in October. “And, particularly, I think with COVID we’ve seen an acceleration of the shift of activities online, and that suggests that if we want to be ready to develop any kind of digital central bank product, we need to move faster than we thought was going to be necessary.” This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane Yet any tweak to money as we know it is bound to be a high-stakes proposition. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. You don’t need a smartphone to hand someone a cash payment. Physical currency also offers privacy, something authorities in democratic countries say they want to protect, even if it keeps some of them up at night over concerns such as money laundering. Still, cash was in decline even before the pandemic. As electronic and contactless payments have surged, the combined monetary value of cash transactions shrank to 0.9 per cent of total transactions in 2019, from 1.4 per cent in 2014, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. Photo by Francis Racine/Cornwall Standard-Freeholder/Postmedia Network files “What we are starting to see is extensions of trends that have already occurred,” Tracey Black, chief executive of Payments Canada, said. The trend away from cash has likely gained further momentum during the pandemic, partly because a number of people have likely come to see bills and coins as virus carriers. Payments Canada in a recent survey found that 42 per cent of Canadians polled were uncomfortable handling cash in general. Even post-pandemic, approximately 34 per cent of those surveyed did not expect to return to using cash as much as they did pre-COVID-19.

Article content continued The Bank of Canada urged retailers in the earlier days of the pandemic to keep accepting cash to ensure everyone could buy what they need. More recently, Bank of England research found that the risk of transmitting COVID-19 via banknotes is low. However, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report that fewer than five per cent of Canadians have used a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, to make a recent purchase. This is partly why the Bank of Canada in February said it saw no reason yet to create digital cash, although it also said it still had to be ready to do so just in case. Those statements came after Facebook Inc. created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra, which was recently rebranded as Diem. Members of the Diem Association — which still aims to launch a payment system with “Diem Coins” backed by cash and short-term government debt — include Ottawa-based Shopify Inc. and Spotify Technology SA. Facebook created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters Illustration files The Libra announcement caught the attention of policy-makers, who pushed back against the original vision, hence the recent rebrand and tweaks to the overall vision. Still, one of the concerns was that if enough people used something like a Libra/Diem “stablecoin,” it could sideline monetary gatekeepers such as the Bank of Canada. If too many Canadians conduct their financial affairs in a currency other than the dollar, they won’t much care about the setting of interest rates, making it harder for the central bank to manage inflation. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued This sort of concern, as well as innovation and the proliferation of digital payment options, has central banks thinking about their own central bank digital currency (CBDC). A survey of 66 central banks published earlier this year found approximately 80 per cent of them were doing some kind of CBDC-related work as of 2019, up from around 70 per cent a year earlier. The digital cash these banks could ultimately issue would not replace physical cash entirely, but might instead be accepted alongside it, as another form of payment backed by the government. CBDC, Payments Canada explained in another recent report, “is a digital liability of the central bank” that can be used to pay for things. In other words, similar to cash. The Bank of Canada would be on the hook for its digital currency, which citizens could use to spend on things the same way they would with bank notes. Issuing a CBDC could also “potentially counter” a threat such as Libra, Bank of Canada staffers said back in February. Some countries have already taken the CBDC concept for a test drive. Sweden’s central bank has piloted an “e-krona,” the Bahamas has launched a digital “Sand Dollar” and China is readying a central-bank-backed virtual currency of its own. In February, the Bank of Canada signalled it was working on a contingency plan for the day it might need a digital currency in the event that cash stopped being widely accepted or private digital currencies became all the rage. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued COVID-19 has hastened that planning. In November, now-former Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank had “stepped up our work on central bank digital currency, given that COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital payments.” The Bank of Canada also joined with the European, Japanese, Swedish, Swiss, English and U.S. central banks in October in publishing “common foundational principles and core features” of CBDCs. According to those guidelines, issuing a digital currency shouldn’t upend the financial system, such as by causing a bank run if people pull their money from commercial lenders and put it into virtual cash. The central banks also said a digital currency should “coexist with and complement existing forms of money,” and spark innovation and efficiency. A conveyer belt with objects is used to demonstrate blockchain technology. Photo by David Becker/Getty Images files Central bankers identified 14 core features of any CBDC, including that it should be as easy to use as cash. There would also need to be a ledger to keep track of things, which could look similar to the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin. The central banks also see potential for digital currencies to be used in ways beyond everyday payments, such as when governments need to speedily send funds to citizens in need, as they have during the pandemic. The Bank of Canada back in February touched on a few other reasons as to why a digital currency would be helpful. For one, if everyone started using a digital currency created by a private company, a lender of last resort such as the Bank of Canada can’t start cranking out that currency to bail out commercial financial institutions in a crisis. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Moreover, having a private company in charge of a widely used currency could go against the public’s interest, since that company would naturally be guided by a profit motive, not necessarily what’s best for society at large. The Bank of Canada maintains that it has an obligation to ensure that every Canadian has access to a unit of exchange they can use for free. That’s one of the reasons policy-makers are so protective of cash. But the main reason a central bank would issue a digital currency is probably control, specifically, the fear of losing control of monetary matters to a company or another country. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value by setting interest rates in a way that keeps prices stable. The monetary sovereignty of a country could be jeopardized if a company or another country’s digital currency gained enough traction. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value. Photo by Brent Lewin/Bloomberg files “A risk of stablecoins, so-called ‘cryptocurrencies’ and foreign CBDCs is that domestic users adopt them in significant numbers and use of the domestic sovereign currency dwindles,” the October report from the Bank of Canada and other central banks said. “In extremis, such a ‘digital dollarisation’ could see a national currency substituted by another with the domestic central bank gradually losing control over monetary matters.” That risk could be compounded depending on who is providing the hot new currency. China, noted Barry Campbell, a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance, has aimed to increase the global importance of its currency. Being a digital currency trailblazer could help those efforts. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “It’s actually a geopolitical issue, it’s not just an issue over dollars and cents,” said Campbell, now president of Toronto-based lobbying firm Campbell Strategies Inc., of CBDCs. “This working group of the central banks … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf.” Perhaps with this in mind, Bank of Canada staffers said in a June report that the central bank was looking at “multiple formats” for a digital currency, including the use of a “custom device that is engineered for universal access while securely storing and transferring a CBDC.” These universal access devices (UAD) “could incorporate attributes of cash and take advantage of specialized technologies,” the report said. Those cash-like features could include making it wallet-sized and allowing for small transactions. This working group … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf Barry Campbell, former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance “They have to be ready in case the necessity arises that they have to provide a digital alternative to cash,” said Thorsten Koeppl, an economics professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont. Yet the death of cash is likely years away, if it ever actually happens. In April, for instance, Bank of Canada staffers, working with Ipsos and Statistics Canada, found that 74 per cent of the people they surveyed had no plans to go cashless. “I think inclusion is something that we really have to continue to monitor, and to make sure that there’s always an opportunity for people who prefer to use cash as tender to be able to purchase the things that they need,” Black, at Payments Canada, said. “I think cash is going to be around for quite some time.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued A digital Canadian currency is likely some ways off as well, even as Payments Canada modernizes its systems and the federal government examines the concept of open banking, which could allow consumers to securely share transaction data with third-party financial service providers. The Bank of Canada in February noted that it will take “several years” to build the capacity to issue a cash-like CBDC, in addition to support from the federal government. The bank also noted that there are other ways to respond to a cashless economy or a boom in private digital currencies, including targeted regulation and improved payment systems, both of which are in the works. The Bank of Canada building in Ottawa. Photo by Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images files A Canadian CBDC is not a sure thing and policy-makers at this point are really just getting cash’s affairs in order. In the meantime, there are still plenty of people relying on it. Kerr at the Salvation Army said the majority of donations had been coming in the form of cash tossed into the bubbles placed in and around places where people shop. Those bills and coins help fund the food banks, shelters and substance-use recovery programs the charity operates. This year’s Christmas kettle campaign was targeting $23 million in donations. Hitting that amount in a normal year would have taken plenty of work and generosity, even before factoring in declining cash use and the coronavirus pandemic. But the “touchless giving units” are expected to help. According to Tiptap, a pilot of the devices on Salvation Army kettles last year in Toronto led to three times the donation amounts at those bubbles compared to cash-only ones. “It is,” Kerr said, “a new day.” Financial Post • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: The Great Rethink: Cash is no longer king and the transition is going to be a high-stakes affair Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Fear of coronavirus-tainted money grows in U.S., opening new front in the war on cash Back to video And across the financial industry, a rigorous debate is brewing over how to address the public’s mounting concern that greenbacks might transmit COVID-19. Studies show it’s at least theoretically possible for other coronaviruses to survive on the dollar’s cotton-and-linen weave, though there’s little agreement on the actual risk of contagion.

Article content continued Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there’s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it’s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it’s safe. The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue. On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it’s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low — comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail. ‘Hygienic’ Payments If, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry’s long-running “war on cash,” sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Visa and Mastercard credit cards. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg files The virus may end up serving as a “trigger event” for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said. “Digital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,” she said. “This is another reason: ‘Oh, and it’s hygienic too.'” Fighting for Poor And on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going “cashless.” Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted. Some of those groups worry they’re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus. “Going cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,” said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. “We certainly wouldn’t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you’re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Despite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10. Cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked — with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open. “If you want to go that direction, it’s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,” John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. “There’s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.” Paper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects. One study in 2013 showed the dollar has the ability to show “significant and prolonged carriage” of the dreaded Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria known as MSRA.

So far during the current outbreak, the Fed hasn’t widely enacted its longstanding protocol for banks handling bills suspected of being dangerous: First stacking them in “straps” of 100, then bundling those into larger bricks and packaging them in plastic bags with the word “CONTAMINATED” scribbled in permanent ink. Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world’s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector. “In the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat said in an interview. “People are just not traveling internationally and this is one of the most profitable businesses that these companies have.” Bloomberg.com Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Fear of coronavirus-tainted money grows in U.S., opening new front in the war on cash Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Visitors to Britain during the previous two weeks prior to arrival in Canada will be referred to health officials for additional assessments, screening and questions. They will also have to go into quarantine for 14 days. “We believe (these measures) are among the strongest in the world,” Blair said, adding that those who lied about having not been in Britain could face imprisonment and big fines. Fewer than 2% of coronavirus cases in Canada have been linked to international travel, Blair said. A second wave of coronavirus is sweeping across Canada and authorities have only just begun to inoculate the population using Pfizer’s vaccine. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said a decision on whether to approve Moderna Inc’s vaccine should come very soon but gave no details. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Monday announced a partial shutdown of some businesses starting Dec. 26 and banned most indoor gatherings. Cases continue to rise steadily and chief public health officer Theresa Tam said she was particularly worried about the increasing number of people being hospitalized at a time when health care workers are exhausted. “It’s going to be much more difficult for us to manage in the next few months,” she said.

The adjustments were necessary to protect volunteers from a highly contagious and deadly disease. But the Salvation Army, one of the country’s oldest charities, is now also one of a growing number of entities coming to grips with a simple fact: people are using cash much less often to pay for things, and that trend has all sorts of ramifications for central banks and society at large.

Photo by Ian Kucerak/Postmedia News The move to a cash-lite society has been happening for a while. Payments Canada, the non-profit that owns and operates this country’s payment clearing and settlement systems, found that the number of overall payment transactions by cash declined to 18.4 per cent in 2019 from 32.8 per cent in 2014. COVID-19 appears to have accelerated the trend. Some grew fearful of handling cash amid reports that it could be a conduit for the virus, but there has also been a shift to e-commerce fuelled by the forced closure of brick-and-mortar stores. Online sales by traditional retailers increased more than 74 per cent from a year earlier in September, according to Statistics Canada.

Article content continued It has all prompted some existential thinking about the future of money. Metal circles and paper bills with animals and monarchs stamped all over them are being hoarded, not spent, according to Bank of Canada data. In addition to cash and cards, consumers can now make payments using a variety of apps or “wearables,” such as smart watches. In some cases they are even experimenting with digital currencies. This trend may be creating a lot of convenience for consumers, but policy-makers see cash as a public good and, therefore, feel duty bound to ensure it (or, perhaps, something like it) is there for people to use. More On This Topic Digital cash may seem inevitable, but the Bank of Canada isn’t quite ready to concede Christine Lagarde says her ‘hunch’ is that ECB will adopt digital currency Bank of Canada says digital currencies need globally coordinated approach Pandemic accelerates need to consider digital currency: Bank of Canada Adding to that concern are the digital currencies being developed by both the private and public sectors, as widespread support by citizens for something other than the national currency could challenge a country’s control over its monetary affairs. Any of these factors would have been enough to get the attention of authorities. With all of them converging at once, Canadian central bankers and their allies abroad have been forced to speed up plans for digital currencies of their own, if only to ensure the groundwork is in place should the need to issue such a currency arise. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued If cash is no longer king, policymakers are at least thinking about the line of succession. “This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving,” Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane said during a virtual panel discussion in October. “And, particularly, I think with COVID we’ve seen an acceleration of the shift of activities online, and that suggests that if we want to be ready to develop any kind of digital central bank product, we need to move faster than we thought was going to be necessary.” This is all looking a lot more urgent because of the speed with which technology is evolving Bank of Canada deputy governor Tim Lane Yet any tweak to money as we know it is bound to be a high-stakes proposition. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. You don’t need a smartphone to hand someone a cash payment. Physical currency also offers privacy, something authorities in democratic countries say they want to protect, even if it keeps some of them up at night over concerns such as money laundering. Still, cash was in decline even before the pandemic. As electronic and contactless payments have surged, the combined monetary value of cash transactions shrank to 0.9 per cent of total transactions in 2019, from 1.4 per cent in 2014, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report. Cash is hanging on for a reason: anyone can use it. Photo by Francis Racine/Cornwall Standard-Freeholder/Postmedia Network files “What we are starting to see is extensions of trends that have already occurred,” Tracey Black, chief executive of Payments Canada, said. The trend away from cash has likely gained further momentum during the pandemic, partly because a number of people have likely come to see bills and coins as virus carriers. Payments Canada in a recent survey found that 42 per cent of Canadians polled were uncomfortable handling cash in general. Even post-pandemic, approximately 34 per cent of those surveyed did not expect to return to using cash as much as they did pre-COVID-19. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Bank of Canada urged retailers in the earlier days of the pandemic to keep accepting cash to ensure everyone could buy what they need. More recently, Bank of England research found that the risk of transmitting COVID-19 via banknotes is low. However, Payments Canada noted in its annual trends report that fewer than five per cent of Canadians have used a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, to make a recent purchase. This is partly why the Bank of Canada in February said it saw no reason yet to create digital cash, although it also said it still had to be ready to do so just in case. Those statements came after Facebook Inc. created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra, which was recently rebranded as Diem. Members of the Diem Association — which still aims to launch a payment system with “Diem Coins” backed by cash and short-term government debt — include Ottawa-based Shopify Inc. and Spotify Technology SA. Facebook created a stir last year by announcing plans to back a digital currency, Libra. Photo by Dado Ruvic/Reuters Illustration files The Libra announcement caught the attention of policy-makers, who pushed back against the original vision, hence the recent rebrand and tweaks to the overall vision. Still, one of the concerns was that if enough people used something like a Libra/Diem “stablecoin,” it could sideline monetary gatekeepers such as the Bank of Canada. If too many Canadians conduct their financial affairs in a currency other than the dollar, they won’t much care about the setting of interest rates, making it harder for the central bank to manage inflation. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued This sort of concern, as well as innovation and the proliferation of digital payment options, has central banks thinking about their own central bank digital currency (CBDC). A survey of 66 central banks published earlier this year found approximately 80 per cent of them were doing some kind of CBDC-related work as of 2019, up from around 70 per cent a year earlier. The digital cash these banks could ultimately issue would not replace physical cash entirely, but might instead be accepted alongside it, as another form of payment backed by the government. CBDC, Payments Canada explained in another recent report, “is a digital liability of the central bank” that can be used to pay for things. In other words, similar to cash. The Bank of Canada would be on the hook for its digital currency, which citizens could use to spend on things the same way they would with bank notes. Issuing a CBDC could also “potentially counter” a threat such as Libra, Bank of Canada staffers said back in February. Some countries have already taken the CBDC concept for a test drive. Sweden’s central bank has piloted an “e-krona,” the Bahamas has launched a digital “Sand Dollar” and China is readying a central-bank-backed virtual currency of its own. In February, the Bank of Canada signalled it was working on a contingency plan for the day it might need a digital currency in the event that cash stopped being widely accepted or private digital currencies became all the rage. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued COVID-19 has hastened that planning. In November, now-former Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank had “stepped up our work on central bank digital currency, given that COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital payments.” The Bank of Canada also joined with the European, Japanese, Swedish, Swiss, English and U.S. central banks in October in publishing “common foundational principles and core features” of CBDCs. According to those guidelines, issuing a digital currency shouldn’t upend the financial system, such as by causing a bank run if people pull their money from commercial lenders and put it into virtual cash. The central banks also said a digital currency should “coexist with and complement existing forms of money,” and spark innovation and efficiency. A conveyer belt with objects is used to demonstrate blockchain technology. Photo by David Becker/Getty Images files Central bankers identified 14 core features of any CBDC, including that it should be as easy to use as cash. There would also need to be a ledger to keep track of things, which could look similar to the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin. The central banks also see potential for digital currencies to be used in ways beyond everyday payments, such as when governments need to speedily send funds to citizens in need, as they have during the pandemic. The Bank of Canada back in February touched on a few other reasons as to why a digital currency would be helpful. For one, if everyone started using a digital currency created by a private company, a lender of last resort such as the Bank of Canada can’t start cranking out that currency to bail out commercial financial institutions in a crisis. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Moreover, having a private company in charge of a widely used currency could go against the public’s interest, since that company would naturally be guided by a profit motive, not necessarily what’s best for society at large. The Bank of Canada maintains that it has an obligation to ensure that every Canadian has access to a unit of exchange they can use for free. That’s one of the reasons policy-makers are so protective of cash. But the main reason a central bank would issue a digital currency is probably control, specifically, the fear of losing control of monetary matters to a company or another country. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value by setting interest rates in a way that keeps prices stable. The monetary sovereignty of a country could be jeopardized if a company or another country’s digital currency gained enough traction. The Bank of Canada designs and distributes bank notes, but also takes steps to help ensure money keeps its value. Photo by Brent Lewin/Bloomberg files “A risk of stablecoins, so-called ‘cryptocurrencies’ and foreign CBDCs is that domestic users adopt them in significant numbers and use of the domestic sovereign currency dwindles,” the October report from the Bank of Canada and other central banks said. “In extremis, such a ‘digital dollarisation’ could see a national currency substituted by another with the domestic central bank gradually losing control over monetary matters.” That risk could be compounded depending on who is providing the hot new currency. China, noted Barry Campbell, a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance, has aimed to increase the global importance of its currency. Being a digital currency trailblazer could help those efforts. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “It’s actually a geopolitical issue, it’s not just an issue over dollars and cents,” said Campbell, now president of Toronto-based lobbying firm Campbell Strategies Inc., of CBDCs. “This working group of the central banks … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf.” Perhaps with this in mind, Bank of Canada staffers said in a June report that the central bank was looking at “multiple formats” for a digital currency, including the use of a “custom device that is engineered for universal access while securely storing and transferring a CBDC.” These universal access devices (UAD) “could incorporate attributes of cash and take advantage of specialized technologies,” the report said. Those cash-like features could include making it wallet-sized and allowing for small transactions. This working group … is an indication of just how seriously central banks are starting to look at this and, if you will, protect their turf Barry Campbell, former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance “They have to be ready in case the necessity arises that they have to provide a digital alternative to cash,” said Thorsten Koeppl, an economics professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont. Yet the death of cash is likely years away, if it ever actually happens. In April, for instance, Bank of Canada staffers, working with Ipsos and Statistics Canada, found that 74 per cent of the people they surveyed had no plans to go cashless. “I think inclusion is something that we really have to continue to monitor, and to make sure that there’s always an opportunity for people who prefer to use cash as tender to be able to purchase the things that they need,” Black, at Payments Canada, said. “I think cash is going to be around for quite some time.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued A digital Canadian currency is likely some ways off as well, even as Payments Canada modernizes its systems and the federal government examines the concept of open banking, which could allow consumers to securely share transaction data with third-party financial service providers. The Bank of Canada in February noted that it will take “several years” to build the capacity to issue a cash-like CBDC, in addition to support from the federal government. The bank also noted that there are other ways to respond to a cashless economy or a boom in private digital currencies, including targeted regulation and improved payment systems, both of which are in the works. The Bank of Canada building in Ottawa. Photo by Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images files A Canadian CBDC is not a sure thing and policy-makers at this point are really just getting cash’s affairs in order. In the meantime, there are still plenty of people relying on it. Kerr at the Salvation Army said the majority of donations had been coming in the form of cash tossed into the bubbles placed in and around places where people shop. Those bills and coins help fund the food banks, shelters and substance-use recovery programs the charity operates. This year’s Christmas kettle campaign was targeting $23 million in donations. Hitting that amount in a normal year would have taken plenty of work and generosity, even before factoring in declining cash use and the coronavirus pandemic. But the “touchless giving units” are expected to help. According to Tiptap, a pilot of the devices on Salvation Army kettles last year in Toronto led to three times the donation amounts at those bubbles compared to cash-only ones. “It is,” Kerr said, “a new day.” Financial Post • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: The Great Rethink: Cash is no longer king and the transition is going to be a high-stakes affair Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Fear of coronavirus-tainted money grows in U.S., opening new front in the war on cash Back to video And across the financial industry, a rigorous debate is brewing over how to address the public’s mounting concern that greenbacks might transmit COVID-19. Studies show it’s at least theoretically possible for other coronaviruses to survive on the dollar’s cotton-and-linen weave, though there’s little agreement on the actual risk of contagion.

Article content continued Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there’s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it’s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it’s safe. The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue. On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it’s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low — comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail. ‘Hygienic’ Payments If, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry’s long-running “war on cash,” sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Visa and Mastercard credit cards. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg files The virus may end up serving as a “trigger event” for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said. “Digital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,” she said. “This is another reason: ‘Oh, and it’s hygienic too.'” Fighting for Poor And on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going “cashless.” Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted. Some of those groups worry they’re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus. “Going cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,” said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. “We certainly wouldn’t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you’re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10. Cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S. Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked — with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open. “If you want to go that direction, it’s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,” John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. “There’s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.” Paper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects.

Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world’s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector. “In the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,” Sanford C.

They pointed out that corporate support is based on other issues that are important to them, and predicted that companies would wait to see how the furor over the confirmation played out. They added that the controversial incumbent senators supporting Trump’s efforts could be preferable to potential primary challengers from the right. Still, companies may face external pressure over their financial support for politicians who are pushing election fraud claims that have been rejected by a succession of courts and state officials.

Article content continued Steve Schmidt, a founder of The Lincoln Project, warned on Sunday night that the political action committee led by Bush-era Republicans would turn its fire on corporate donors who professed support for racial equality while funding politicians seeking to “throw out millions of Black votes.” In a series of tweets, Schmidt threatened that his well-funded group would not just draw attention to companies’ political spending, but would “foment employee rebellions and shareholder revolts” in its effort to “strangle the money flow” to Trump’s congressional supporters.

The FT’s analysis found that more than 20 Business Roundtable members — including EY, FedEx, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft — have funded at least one of the senators the group’s statement implicitly critiques. Despite its statement decrying efforts to overturn the election result, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce declined to say whether it would make vote certification a litmus test for its future Congressional endorsements. “That means there are no consequences to a representative or senator who does not heed the chamber’s (request),” said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which tracks corporate contributions. Even so, Freed said that companies faced “a moment of truth” with regard to their political spending.

Article content A red-hot trend in the car industry is for new entrants such as Fisker Inc. to hand over the complicated and capital-intensive work of engineering and building vehicles to a contract manufacturer. Increasingly, cars are judged on their software and electronics so why bother wasting time and money on metal bashing? If Apple Inc. is indeed seriously considering launching its own vehicle, as press reports suggest, then it will almost certainly decide to outsource, as it does with the iPhone. Apple designs the phone and its operating system but employs Foxconn to assemble components into a handset. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

A $21-billion wager on who will build the Apple car — hint: it's a Canadian company Back to video There’s at least one big contract manufacturer ready to take advantage of these seismic industry changes: Canada’s Magna International Inc. “If Apple is serious about building a car … Magna Steyr should build it,” says Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally. Even if Apple doesn’t come knocking, the manufacturer is already advising tech groups and startups looking to enter the automotive business, and investors have taken notice. Magna’s shares have almost trebled since March, giving it a US$21-billion market value. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued For a great primer on Magna and its earlier car development work with Apple (those discussions didn’t ultimately go anywhere) do read this piece from 2016 by my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Alex Webb and Bloomberg News writers. Magna is one of the world’s biggest car-parts suppliers, having generated nearly US$40 billion of revenue in 2019 from products such as transmissions, vehicle cameras, mirrors and seating. The contract manufacturing subsidiary, Magna Steyr, is the really interesting piece. It builds niche premium vehicles at a factory in Graz, Austria, including the Mercedes G-Class 4×4, the electric Jaguar I-Pace and the BMW Z4 sportscar. Typically those companies choose to outsource the work, rather than retool or build a new production line, because the sales volumes are relatively small. In 2019 Magna assembled almost 160,000 vehicles — more than many carmakers produce — and generated US$6.7 billion of revenue from these activities. Together with joint venture partner Beijing Automotive Group Co. (BAIC) it recently added another facility in China, which is capable of producing 180,000 vehicles yearly. A north American plant might be next. If Apple is serious about building a car ... Magna Steyr should build it Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally Magna’s client roster already extends well beyond the traditional automakers. Henrik Fisker’s eponymous car venture, for one, went public in October after merging with a special purpose acquisition company. A manufacturing and vehicle engineering partnership with Magna is key to Fisker’s asset-light approach. The latter often compares this to the Apple-Foxconn relationship and hopes that will avoid the production nightmares that bedevilled Tesla Inc. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Austrian Magna subsidiary is reportedly in talks about producing vehicles for Canoo Inc., another SPAC-backed car startup, while in China it’s started producing the Arcfox for BAIC’s electric vehicle offshoot. Other projects include helping Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo subsidiary integrate self-driving technology into vehicles and working with Sony Corp. to produce the futuristic Vision S prototype car. “It’s not a secret that almost every non-OEM interested in realizing its own complete vehicles is contacting us,” Frank Klein, Magna Steyr’s boss, told investors last year. You can see why new entrants may chose to work with a neutral party like Magna rather than partnering and sharing plans with an existing carmaker that might be a potential rival. As well as providing production capacity, Magna says it can handle the entire vehicle development process. The company was hired to turn chemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe’s Grenadier 4×4 into reality. More On This Topic Apple aims to produce a car that includes its breakthrough battery by 2024, sources say Apple aiming to build self-driving car by 2024, eyes ‘next level’ battery technology: sources Magna to develop driver assistance technology with Fisker Magna beats quarterly profit estimates, raises 2020 sales outlook The vehicles Magna builds in its factories usually include more of its own components and systems than is the case for cars it doesn’t make. It can also take a financial interest in the companies with which it works. If it does what it promises, Magna could end up owning 6 per cent of Fisker. Last year, it invested US$100 million in Waymo. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued These are welcome sweeteners because contract manufacturing’s economics are tough. The vehicle-building subsidiary produced a 2 per cent operating return on sales last year — much lower than the average in other parts of Magna’s business. And there are risks in adding manufacturing capacity for startups who may fail or decide to insource the work themselves. If Apple were to become a Magna customer it would drive the same hard bargain as it does with Foxconn, whose operating margins have shrunk to about 2 per cent. Apple’s is 24 per cent. Still, Magna’s shares look less dauntingly overvalued than many companies with one foot in the electric-vehicle future. Even after its blistering recent run, the stock is priced at less than 12 times forward earnings. The Canadian manufacturer has its attractions even without a Tim Cook order.

Canada to boost screening of UK travelers, sees no sign of mutated COVID-19 Back to video Although Ottawa imposed a 72-hour block on flights from Britain on Sunday, Blair said more steps were needed to handle people who had been in the country and then flown to Canada via Europe or the United States. Visitors to Britain during the previous two weeks prior to arrival in Canada will be referred to health officials for additional assessments, screening and questions. They will also have to go into quarantine for 14 days. “We believe (these measures) are among the strongest in the world,” Blair said, adding that those who lied about having not been in Britain could face imprisonment and big fines. Fewer than 2% of coronavirus cases in Canada have been linked to international travel, Blair said. A second wave of coronavirus is sweeping across Canada and authorities have only just begun to inoculate the population using Pfizer’s vaccine. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said a decision on whether to approve Moderna Inc’s vaccine should come very soon but gave no details. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Monday announced a partial shutdown of some businesses starting Dec. 26 and banned most indoor gatherings. Cases continue to rise steadily and chief public health officer Theresa Tam said she was particularly worried about the increasing number of people being hospitalized at a time when health care workers are exhausted. “It’s going to be much more difficult for us to manage in the next few months,” she said.

Statistics Canada on Jan. 12reported that its “adjusted price index” increased 1.4 per cent in November from a year earlier, compared with a one per cent gain in the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the same period.

Low inflation skeptics are right, just not as right as they think they are Back to video The information is a little dated, but still useful, since it provides a glimpse of some of the numbers that Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem is watching to assure himself that the pandemic hasn’t blown up the central bank’s understanding of price dynamics. The adjusted measure remains near the lower end of the central bank’s comfort zone for annual inflation, which it defines as a range of one per cent to three per cent, justifying its aggressive response to the COVID-19 crisis. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Consumer spending on durable goodsrose at a record pace in the third quarter, so the latest readings of adjusted inflation attach greater importance to items such as cookware and kitchen utensils. However, higher prices for meat and vegetables were responsible for much of the gap between the two inflation measures, Statistics Canada said. The outsized influence of food could also cause Macklem and his deputies to look past the number. Households may be feeling the pinch of higher grocery bills, but central banks tend to focus on other prices because the cost of food is so volatile. Still, the rate of change is noteworthy. The adjusted measure, like the CPI, was negative in May, reflecting the severity of the recession that followed the initial lockdowns. The two gauges were roughly the same in June, and then a gap of 0.3 percentage points appeared in July and has remained around that figure ever since. The adjusted CPI is a measure that Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada effectively created on the fly, since it was obvious to everyone that the lockdowns and social-distancing measures would affect spending patterns, potentially so much that the historical demand for some goods and services would be useless in calculating inflation during the pandemic.

Article content continued For example, the cost of airline tickets dropped, offsetting higher prices for the staples that households stockpiled during the first wave of COVID-19. But how relevant are cheap flights to the overall cost of living when no one wants to fly? The adjusted measure is an attempt to reweight components in the CPI in real time, which is tricky, because it’s an exercise that statisticians prefer to conduct with plenty of hindsight. Central bankers were taken aback last year when surveys indicated the public was skeptical of the Bank of Canada’s contention that inflation was essentially dormant, given the annual change in the CPI rarely breached two per cent, the rough target that guides interest rates. “They think the price increases that they’re facing are higher than they are measured by Statistics Canada’s measurement,” Carolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada’s former senior deputy governor,said in an interview in September, around the time she announced her plan to resign. “Perceptions are really quite important. Da Vinci said all of our knowledge has its origins in perceptions and I think that’s true. So we need to understand, why is that?” The reason appears to have something to do with a decline in the public’s faith in institutions such as the Bank of Canada and Statistics Canada. Consumers are influenced by the cost of items they purchase most often, not the broad basket of goods and services that Statistics Canada tracks. As a result, households coping with surging monthly housing payments, on top of the usual volatility in food prices, will naturally be skeptical when central bankers declare that inflation is dormant.

Article content continued The risk is that the pandemic exacerbates those doubts because inflation expectations can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. That would make the Bank of Canada’s job harder, and could force it to raise interest rates even if conditions on the ground don’t call for it. To be sure, that’s a worst-case scenario. The Bank of Canada’s latest quarterly survey of consumer expectations, conducted Nov. 10 to Dec. 1,found that respondents see inflation of about 3.1 per cent in five years, a decrease from about 3.6 per cent in the third quarter. However, consumers also said they anticipate inflation of 2.86 per cent over the next 12 months, a big jump from about 2.2 per cent in the previous report. The central bank said the shift probably had something to do with higher gasoline prices, “as this component tends to influence households’ views about overall inflation.” That probably explains it. But the latest numbers show that Wilkins was right to worry about perceptions. Measured inflation is at the low end of the Bank of Canada’s comfort zone, arguing for stimulus, while expectations are at the high end, suggesting the central bank should be raising interest rates. The Bank of Canada has some more explaining to do.

The Canadian dollar has shot up to its highest level since early 2018, chiefly because of weakness in its U.S. counterpart, the Bank of Canada said in a monetary policy report released on Wednesday.

Bank of Canada warns surging loonie could pose risk to economic outlook Back to video A stronger dollar was also explicitly included on the monetary policy report’s list of risks to the Bank of Canada’s inflation outlook for the first time since July 2011, when oil prices were almost double what they are today and the loonie was trading at around US$1. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said that a Canadian dollar that is increasing in value because of made-in-Canada reasons “tends to act mostly as a shock absorber,” such as a higher price of oil that is matched by a more valuable loonie. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “On the other hand, what we’re seeing now is most of the appreciation in the Canadian dollar is coming because of a broad-based depreciation of the U.S. dollar,” Macklem told reporters during a press conference. “That’s not a made-in-Canada development. So, the exchange rate is becoming a factor in its own right in our projection.” Macklem’s comments followed the Bank of Canada’s decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent. The loonie rose from about 78.7 cents US pre-decision to more than 79 cents US shortly after. In making its announcement, the central bank said the world is still rife with uncertainty, and that the economic outlook continues to hinge on the coronavirus pandemic and vaccine rollouts. A stronger dollar could throw another wrench into that economic outlook. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. Photo by Blair Gable/Reuters files “Appreciation of the Canadian dollar creates direct downward pressure on inflation by lowering the prices of imports,” Wednesday’s monetary policy report said. “Further appreciation of the Canadian dollar could slow output growth by reducing the competitiveness of Canadian exports and import-competing production. Slower output growth would also imply more disinflationary pressures.” Inflation — a measure of how much the prices for goods and services are increasing — is key to the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy decisions, namely the setting of its key interest rate. The bank’s target for inflation is a two per cent year-over-year increase in the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the change in cost of a basket of products. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Bank of Canada said Wednesday that CPI inflation has climbed to the “low end” of its one to three per cent target range in recent months and that it is forecast to temporarily reach around two per cent in the first half of 2020. Inflation is “expected to return sustainably” to two per cent in 2023, the bank said. The Bank of Canada’s latest projection is based on an exchange rate of 78 cents US, the prevailing rate at the time of the projection, a two-cent increase over October’s forecast. Moreover, the bank said the Canadian economy shrunk by 5.5 per cent in pandemic-stricken 2020, although it predicted a four-per-cent rebound in 2021. “We think there’s a disconnect between the Canadian dollar and economic fundamentals,” said Darcy Briggs, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. “It will have an impact on the economy if it continues to strengthen.” More On This Topic Bank of Canada sees economy shrinking in first quarter as second wave makes for choppy recovery Why the Bank of Canada could be among the first to raise interest rates Some plain talk about the dollar from Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem High loonie on the radar as Bank of Canada sees ‘choppy’ recovery from pandemic Briggs said Canada’s currency is being pushed higher by a “reflation trade,” or a bet that the global economy is in the early stages of a recovery from one of the most epic collapses in history. The outlook has emboldened currency traders to take on more risk, prompting them to sell U.S. dollars and use the proceeds to place bets on other currencies, including the loonie. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “It’s tightening financial conditions,” Briggs said of the stronger exchange rate, offsetting some of the stimulus provided by lower interest rates. The Bank of Canada also said Wednesday that it would continue its bond-buying quantitative easing program as is for now, purchasing at least $4 billion a week in debt, although that could be adjusted as the economy improves. “Vaccines are riding to the rescue of the Bank of Canada’s economic outlook,” wrote Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, in a note to clients. “But with the pandemic still raging for now, the Canadian dollar perhaps looking a bit too strong and inflation too low for its liking, the Bank of Canada underscored that it will be very patient in deciding when to take its foot off the gas.” — With files from Kevin Carmichael • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Bank of Canada warns surging loonie could pose risk to economic outlook Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Paris-based BNP Paribas SA’s currency portfolio is “overweight” loonies and Momtchil Pojarliev is advising the bank’s clients to do the same. He reckons the Canadian dollar is undervalued, since the petrocurrency’s price hasn’t fully adjusted to the likelihood of stronger oil prices as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Why the Bank of Canada could be among the first to raise interest rates Back to video Pojarliev also thinks the Bank of Canada will be one of the first major central banks to raise interest rates, because stronger commodity prices and decent economic growth will force governor Tiff Macklem and his deputies to confront inflationary pressures sooner than most of their peers. To be sure, these are future considerations. There won’t be any talk of higher interest rates when the Bank of Canada’s leaders conclude their latest round of policy deliberations on Jan. 20. The most pressing concerns for the central bank at this stage are whether a grim winter will cripple the recovery, and when to slow its multi-billion-dollar bond-purchase program, which could create asset-price bubbles if left in place too long. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Stephen Poloz, the previous governor, on Jan. 14 said he anticipates a “double-dip” recession, meaning he assumes the lockdowns that have followed the second wave of COVID-19 infections will trigger a second economic contraction, albeit not as epic as what occurred last spring. “We’re off to a rough start for the new year,” Poloz said over video during an event hosted by Western University’s Ivey Business School. “The economy is very likely to form a ‘W,’ economists’ parlance for the double-dip, although the second half of the W may not be as significant as the first half was given what we’ve learned in the interim.” Macklem in December acknowledged that things could get tougher in the short term, with the central bank anticipating a “choppy trajectory” until a critical mass of the population is vaccinated. That’s the main reason he promised in October to leave the benchmark interest rate pinned near zero until some time in 2023, a pledge he will likely reiterate this week. Vaccines have arrived sooner than the central bank expected they would. Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press files The governor and his deputies will probably decide there is enough stimulus in place to power through whatever winter brings. Vaccines have arrived sooner than the central bank expected they would in the fall, suggesting the outlook for 2021 has improved. Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, earlier this month predicted that Canada’s gross domestic product will decline at an annual rate of 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, and then rebound at rates of 7.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent in the second and third quarters, respectively. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Employment plunged by 63,000 positions in December, the first decline since April, but the news isn’t all bad. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. on Jan. 18 said its trend measure of housing starts increased 13 per cent in December from a year earlier, suggesting the economy confronted the second wave with some momentum. Meanwhile, China’s government said the country’s gross domestic product increased 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, a positive omen for global demand and commodity prices, since the world’s second-largest economy appears to have returned to pre-pandemic growth rates. But if Pojarliev is right, then Macklem will be getting antsy about blowing past his inflation target by this time in 2023, if not sooner. BNP is advising its clients to be ready for a half-percentage-point increase in the benchmark interest rate in a couple of years, creating a gap with other rich countries. The policy rate will still be less than one per cent, but “in a world where everyone else is at zero or negative, it’s quite a lot,” Pojarliev said on a Webex call with reporters last week. There are at least a few other smart people out there who anticipate inflation heating up by the end of the year. Three of the nine members on C.D. Howe Institute’s Monetary Policy Council, a self-appointed shadow committee of the Bank of Canada, last week said Macklem should raise interest rates by at least a quarter point by the start of next year. More On This Topic Why Confederation is both the cause of and the solution to our economic woes Low inflation skeptics are right, just not as right as they think they are Meet a rising Canadian corporate champion that’s showing other companies how it’s done Why dealing with China requires a more sophisticated tack than some are demanding Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Consumer Price Index was one per cent in November, suggesting the economy was still suffering the effects of an historic contraction, but the Bank of Canada’s three core measures, which correct for volatility, were all closer to two per cent, the central bank’s rough target. There’s a wildcard, though. The decade of weak inflation that followed the Great Recession has policy-makers thinking it might be possible to run their economies hotter in the future. They are also becoming less shy about accepting a role in spreading the benefits of economic growth more widely, which, in the case of central banks, means tempting inflation in order to create more jobs for women, racial minorities and other historically marginalized groups. They are adjusting their approaches to monetary policy accordingly. “Our new framework absolutely squarely describes maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal,” Lael Brainard, a governor at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, said of the Fed’s recently revised approach to setting interest rates. The Bank of Canada is scheduled to complete its own policy review by the end of the year. Adding an employment target is on the table, as is an approach called “average-inflation targeting,” which would give policy-makers more flexibility to tolerate faster price increases. That’s how the Fed does it, and few think it will be raising rates in early 2023. If Canada changes its monetary policy regime, the Bank of Canada probably won’t be either.

Working from home is starting to fall apart, top bankers warn Back to video In the corporate world, “if you ask anyone today, it feels like it is fraying, it’s hard, it takes a lot of inner strength and sustainability every single day to continue to focus and to not have the energy you get from being around other people,” she said. Both executives spoke by videoconference as the pandemic has meant the WEF has gone virtual for the first time, rather than its usual mass gathering of prominent corporate and government figures in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Staley said: “It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued He predicted that more people would come back to offices to work, but with flexibility to work from home. Erdoes said executives believed that part of the initial success of working from home was due to adrenalin from having to adapt so quickly. Erdoes, citing a conversation a JPMorgan strategist had with drugmaker Moderna Inc., said it’s possible that COVID-19 could persist for a long time amid mutating strains — and instead of more videoconferencing, “the world is going to have to open up.” Staley said small companies and consumers are increasing their deposits and decreasing their borrowing. Amid pent-up demand, economies could come roaring back in the second half of this year — “if we can wrestle the pandemic down.” He compared that possibility to the “roaring Twenties” pulling the world out of a lull after the 1918 influenza epidemic. Erdoes had another comparison to past decades: the tech-stock froth of 20 years ago, and how it reminds her of the current demand for blank-cheque companies and wild trading in Bitcoin and GameStop Corp.

The Canadian dollar has shot up to its highest level since early 2018, chiefly because of weakness in its U.S. counterpart, the Bank of Canada said in a monetary policy report released on Wednesday.

Bank of Canada warns surging loonie could pose risk to economic outlook Back to video A stronger dollar was also explicitly included on the monetary policy report’s list of risks to the Bank of Canada’s inflation outlook for the first time since July 2011, when oil prices were almost double what they are today and the loonie was trading at around US$1. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said that a Canadian dollar that is increasing in value because of made-in-Canada reasons “tends to act mostly as a shock absorber,” such as a higher price of oil that is matched by a more valuable loonie.

Article content continued “On the other hand, what we’re seeing now is most of the appreciation in the Canadian dollar is coming because of a broad-based depreciation of the U.S. dollar,” Macklem told reporters during a press conference. “That’s not a made-in-Canada development. So, the exchange rate is becoming a factor in its own right in our projection.” Macklem’s comments followed the Bank of Canada’s decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent. The loonie rose from about 78.7 cents US pre-decision to more than 79 cents US shortly after. In making its announcement, the central bank said the world is still rife with uncertainty, and that the economic outlook continues to hinge on the coronavirus pandemic and vaccine rollouts. A stronger dollar could throw another wrench into that economic outlook. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. Photo by Blair Gable/Reuters files “Appreciation of the Canadian dollar creates direct downward pressure on inflation by lowering the prices of imports,” Wednesday’s monetary policy report said. “Further appreciation of the Canadian dollar could slow output growth by reducing the competitiveness of Canadian exports and import-competing production. Slower output growth would also imply more disinflationary pressures.” Inflation — a measure of how much the prices for goods and services are increasing — is key to the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy decisions, namely the setting of its key interest rate. The bank’s target for inflation is a two per cent year-over-year increase in the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the change in cost of a basket of products. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued The Bank of Canada said Wednesday that CPI inflation has climbed to the “low end” of its one to three per cent target range in recent months and that it is forecast to temporarily reach around two per cent in the first half of 2020. Inflation is “expected to return sustainably” to two per cent in 2023, the bank said. The Bank of Canada’s latest projection is based on an exchange rate of 78 cents US, the prevailing rate at the time of the projection, a two-cent increase over October’s forecast. Moreover, the bank said the Canadian economy shrunk by 5.5 per cent in pandemic-stricken 2020, although it predicted a four-per-cent rebound in 2021. “We think there’s a disconnect between the Canadian dollar and economic fundamentals,” said Darcy Briggs, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. “It will have an impact on the economy if it continues to strengthen.” More On This Topic Bank of Canada sees economy shrinking in first quarter as second wave makes for choppy recovery Why the Bank of Canada could be among the first to raise interest rates Some plain talk about the dollar from Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem High loonie on the radar as Bank of Canada sees ‘choppy’ recovery from pandemic Briggs said Canada’s currency is being pushed higher by a “reflation trade,” or a bet that the global economy is in the early stages of a recovery from one of the most epic collapses in history. The outlook has emboldened currency traders to take on more risk, prompting them to sell U.S. dollars and use the proceeds to place bets on other currencies, including the loonie.

Article content continued “It’s tightening financial conditions,” Briggs said of the stronger exchange rate, offsetting some of the stimulus provided by lower interest rates. The Bank of Canada also said Wednesday that it would continue its bond-buying quantitative easing program as is for now, purchasing at least $4 billion a week in debt, although that could be adjusted as the economy improves. “Vaccines are riding to the rescue of the Bank of Canada’s economic outlook,” wrote Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, in a note to clients. “But with the pandemic still raging for now, the Canadian dollar perhaps looking a bit too strong and inflation too low for its liking, the Bank of Canada underscored that it will be very patient in deciding when to take its foot off the gas.” — With files from Kevin Carmichael • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Bank of Canada warns surging loonie could pose risk to economic outlook Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

The report from budget officer Yves Giroux says the number of people claiming the deduction is likely to skyrocket this year. The PBO report anticipates that more renters will file for deductions using the more complicated approach because they can claim the cost of rent, while homeowners may opt for the simplified method because they can’t claim mortgage or capital costs.

That’s because the activity appears to have been inspired and led by voluntary groups of retail investors — empowered by new technologies that have expanded access to markets and emboldened by posts on social media sites such as Reddit — and not registered professionals. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Reddit revolution leaves market regulators with limited playbook — but Canadian watchdogs may have an edge Back to video There is no closed market system anymore and that means we have to rethink the system Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission “Registration is what brings traders into the regulatory system,” Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission, told the Financial Post on Tuesday. “The old rules for market professionals and regulator oversight of markets now (don’t) work since these new traders are outside this ambit,” she said. “There is no closed market system anymore and that means we have to rethink the system.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued While some have pointed to the incredible surge in value of some of the stocks — GameStop, a U.S.-based video game retailer saw its stock surge nearly 20-fold in a matter of weeks — as a sure sign manipulation, others have warned that it’s not so easy to draw a line. “GameStop is the focus of current commentary because the fundamentals don’t make sense in relation to the stock price. But some would say the same of Tesla, and who gets to decide?” said Robert Staley, vice chair and partner at law firm Bennett Jones LLP in Toronto. Article content continued “It is hard to see ready regulatory solutions … when what’s happening is an aggregation of individual actions on social media.” GameStop’s U.S.-listed shares, which scaled as high as US$483 last week, fueled by posts on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, deflated this week to US$90 as fee-free broker apps including Robinhood imposed buying curbs. Photo by Reuters/Carlo Allegri Still, in a joint statement late Monday, Canada’s provincial securities watchdogs and the national investment industry regulator said they are closely monitoring the situation, and pledged to take “appropriate regulatory action to protect investors” if “abusive or manipulative trading activity” is found. If regulators were to take this on as a market manipulation case, they would have to prove intent to artificially affect the supply, demand, or price of a security. Such cases have a notoriously high burden of proof, securities lawyers and regulators say. Despite repeated calls on regulators to step in and stop short-selling, where investors routinely talk down stocks, even publicly on social media platforms, short sellers have seldom been reined in by regulators. In both cases, investors are entitled to their opinions, and regulators must demonstrate intent to manipulate. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued Staley cautioned that regulatory intervention at this point could have a detrimental effect on already volatile markets. “You have a bunch of people riding with the herd,” he said. “You know someone is going to get hurt eventually, but a lot of money is being made on the way up, and regulatory intervention in itself could cause the market to crash.” A key question should regulators decide to take aim at the Reddit phenomenon is who to go after? One securities lawyer joked that the first problem would be where to begin when there may be millions of individual investors involved in the largely retail-investor-driven stock frenzy. “If regulators wish to go after anyone in this context, it is not practical to go after retail traders,” said Jon Levin, a partner at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP. “Rather, it would seem to be appropriate to go after the dealers who are processing the trades on behalf of those retail players.” Most of the retail participants in the current market activity have never seen a bear market and do not understand how devastating a sudden turn in the market might be Jon Levin, a partner at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP Canadian regulators have placed increased scrutiny in recent years on the role and obligations of professionals such as brokers and accountants when it comes to maintaining the fairness and integrity of the capital markets. “One of the biggest concerns from a public policy perspective has to be that (these) retail players do not understand the risks they are assuming, particularly the potential downside that they may suffer,” Levin said. “There cannot help but be concern that most of the retail participants in the current market activity have never seen a bear market and do not understand how devastating a sudden turn in the market might be.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued However, attempts to shut down discount brokerages or online forums that are part of the latest market phenomenon are fraught due to concerns over restricting trading in already volatile markets and curtailing freedom of expression. “Any country that embraces free speech cannot have its securities regulator restricting the right of expression,” said Jacob Frenkel, a former senior enforcement lawyer at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now in private practice in Washington, D.C. “Nevertheless,” he said, “the use of social media for fraudulent purposes, that is to manipulate stocks, or to circumvent strict disclosure and investor communications rules, should be enforced strictly.” Staley, the Bennett Jones lawyer, urged regulators to be cautious, particularly because the phenomenon could turn out to be “a herd effect and not manipulation or misrepresentation by people seeking to make a buck.” He warned that “ad hoc solutions may cause more harm than they solve” in terms of systemic risk. “This (phenomenon) is in considerable measure a reaction to large short positions, where people can make money squeezing the shorts if enough people jump in,” Staley said. “There’s no easy solution, especially as shorting serves a valuable commercial purpose.” I am most worried about people using options and margin when they don’t understand it Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission Jensen said her view is that neither investors nor the trading platforms appear to be doing anything illegal or wrong. “But they are taking large risks, some of (them) don’t understand that they are,” the former regulator said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued “The issue is the huge momentum with little knowledge,” she added. “I am most worried about people using (sophisticated investing strategies involving) options and margin when they don’t understand it.” Canada regulators have a unique tool in their arsenal — public interest jurisdiction — which could be activated if they are intent on using regulatory intervention to deal with the latest market activity, according to securities regulators. On the books since the 1960s, it empowers provincial securities regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission with the discretion to make orders on anything that, in its opinion, is in the public interest, even if there is no specific breach of securities law. This gives Canadian regulators broader powers than their counterparts in the United States. Over the years, the OSC has used this discretionary power to impose a broad range of sanctions “in the public interest” — including disgorgement orders and financial penalties. Anita Anand, now Canada’s minister of public services and procurement, once wrote in The University of Toronto Law Journal that it is “the most significant enforcement power that securities regulators in Canada possess.” Nevertheless, that power has been reserved for conduct that rises to the level of “abuse” of investors or the capital markets when there isn’t a specific breach of the law. “Canadian securities regulators obviously have a public interest jurisdiction that might permit them to act,” said Levin, the Faskens lawyer who has more than three decades of corporate law experience on Bay Street. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content continued ”But history suggests they have been loathe to do so.” However, another securities lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak about the issue, said if the current market behaviour is tantamount to “hijacking an auction market to run a protest,” it could be a good test case. On Monday, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada signalled that the stock volatility could have market-wide implications. The investment industry regulator said in a statement that it is “concerned about the impact the increased volatility may be having on some investors” and will use all the tools at its disposal “to monitor market activity, and ensure market integrity in order to protect Canadian investors.” Without naming popular social media sites being used by investors, such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, IIROC also cautioned investors to “be careful where they get their investing information” in what are largely unregulated environments. “It’s important for investors to avoid potentially misinterpreting investment research and subsequently ‘betting the farm’,” the regulator said. • Email: bshecter@postmedia.com | Twitter: BatPost Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Reddit revolution leaves market regulators with limited playbook — but Canadian watchdogs may have an edge Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Top Stories Newsletter Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Article content Drawing on tax data from 2018, the PBO found the number of people who wrote off home offices on their taxes amounted to about 10 per cent of those who worked from home and those people deducted about $1,550 on average. The report from budget officer Yves Giroux says the number of people claiming the deduction is likely to skyrocket this year. The PBO report anticipates that more renters will file for deductions using the more complicated approach because they can claim the cost of rent, while homeowners may opt for the simplified method because they can’t claim mortgage or capital costs. The estimate of $260 million in forgone tax revenue would hit the government’s bottom line in this fiscal year, which closes at the end of March.

Breadcrumb Trail Links News Investing FP Street Reddit revolution leaves market regulators with limited playbook — but Canadian watchdogs may have an edge A big fear is that regulatory intervention itself could cause the market to crash Author of the article: Barbara Shecter Publishing date: Feb 03, 2021 • February 3, 2021 • 6 minute read Regulators around the world have been scrutinizing the recent surges in the stock prices of companies such as GameStop driven by activity on Reddit message boards. Photo by Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Article content Regulators around the world have been scrutinizing the recent social-media-driven surges in the stock prices of companies such as GameStop and AMC, but some securities industry veterans say there may be little they can do because the traditional rules of market oversight don’t apply. That’s because the activity appears to have been inspired and led by voluntary groups of retail investors — empowered by new technologies that have expanded access to markets and emboldened by posts on social media sites such as Reddit — and not registered professionals.

Reddit revolution leaves market regulators with limited playbook — but Canadian watchdogs may have an edge Back to video There is no closed market system anymore and that means we have to rethink the system Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission “Registration is what brings traders into the regulatory system,” Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission, told the Financial Post on Tuesday. “The old rules for market professionals and regulator oversight of markets now (don’t) work since these new traders are outside this ambit,” she said. “There is no closed market system anymore and that means we have to rethink the system.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content While some have pointed to the incredible surge in value of some of the stocks — GameStop, a U.S.-based video game retailer saw its stock surge nearly 20-fold in a matter of weeks — as a sure sign manipulation, others have warned that it’s not so easy to draw a line. “GameStop is the focus of current commentary because the fundamentals don’t make sense in relation to the stock price. But some would say the same of Tesla, and who gets to decide?” said Robert Staley, vice chair and partner at law firm Bennett Jones LLP in Toronto. Article content “It is hard to see ready regulatory solutions … when what’s happening is an aggregation of individual actions on social media.” GameStop’s U.S.-listed shares, which scaled as high as US$483 last week, fueled by posts on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, deflated this week to US$90 as fee-free broker apps including Robinhood imposed buying curbs. Photo by Reuters/Carlo Allegri Still, in a joint statement late Monday, Canada’s provincial securities watchdogs and the national investment industry regulator said they are closely monitoring the situation, and pledged to take “appropriate regulatory action to protect investors” if “abusive or manipulative trading activity” is found. If regulators were to take this on as a market manipulation case, they would have to prove intent to artificially affect the supply, demand, or price of a security. Such cases have a notoriously high burden of proof, securities lawyers and regulators say. Despite repeated calls on regulators to step in and stop short-selling, where investors routinely talk down stocks, even publicly on social media platforms, short sellers have seldom been reined in by regulators. In both cases, investors are entitled to their opinions, and regulators must demonstrate intent to manipulate.

Article content Staley cautioned that regulatory intervention at this point could have a detrimental effect on already volatile markets. “You have a bunch of people riding with the herd,” he said. “You know someone is going to get hurt eventually, but a lot of money is being made on the way up, and regulatory intervention in itself could cause the market to crash.” A key question should regulators decide to take aim at the Reddit phenomenon is who to go after? One securities lawyer joked that the first problem would be where to begin when there may be millions of individual investors involved in the largely retail-investor-driven stock frenzy. “If regulators wish to go after anyone in this context, it is not practical to go after retail traders,” said Jon Levin, a partner at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP. “Rather, it would seem to be appropriate to go after the dealers who are processing the trades on behalf of those retail players.” Most of the retail participants in the current market activity have never seen a bear market and do not understand how devastating a sudden turn in the market might be Jon Levin, a partner at Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP Canadian regulators have placed increased scrutiny in recent years on the role and obligations of professionals such as brokers and accountants when it comes to maintaining the fairness and integrity of the capital markets. “One of the biggest concerns from a public policy perspective has to be that (these) retail players do not understand the risks they are assuming, particularly the potential downside that they may suffer,” Levin said. “There cannot help but be concern that most of the retail participants in the current market activity have never seen a bear market and do not understand how devastating a sudden turn in the market might be.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content However, attempts to shut down discount brokerages or online forums that are part of the latest market phenomenon are fraught due to concerns over restricting trading in already volatile markets and curtailing freedom of expression. “Any country that embraces free speech cannot have its securities regulator restricting the right of expression,” said Jacob Frenkel, a former senior enforcement lawyer at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now in private practice in Washington, D.C. “Nevertheless,” he said, “the use of social media for fraudulent purposes, that is to manipulate stocks, or to circumvent strict disclosure and investor communications rules, should be enforced strictly.” Staley, the Bennett Jones lawyer, urged regulators to be cautious, particularly because the phenomenon could turn out to be “a herd effect and not manipulation or misrepresentation by people seeking to make a buck.” He warned that “ad hoc solutions may cause more harm than they solve” in terms of systemic risk. “This (phenomenon) is in considerable measure a reaction to large short positions, where people can make money squeezing the shorts if enough people jump in,” Staley said. “There’s no easy solution, especially as shorting serves a valuable commercial purpose.” I am most worried about people using options and margin when they don’t understand it Maureen Jensen, former chair of the Ontario Securities Commission Jensen said her view is that neither investors nor the trading platforms appear to be doing anything illegal or wrong. “But they are taking large risks, some of (them) don’t understand that they are,” the former regulator said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “The issue is the huge momentum with little knowledge,” she added. “I am most worried about people using (sophisticated investing strategies involving) options and margin when they don’t understand it.” Canada regulators have a unique tool in their arsenal — public interest jurisdiction — which could be activated if they are intent on using regulatory intervention to deal with the latest market activity, according to securities regulators. On the books since the 1960s, it empowers provincial securities regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission with the discretion to make orders on anything that, in its opinion, is in the public interest, even if there is no specific breach of securities law. This gives Canadian regulators broader powers than their counterparts in the United States. Over the years, the OSC has used this discretionary power to impose a broad range of sanctions “in the public interest” — including disgorgement orders and financial penalties. Anita Anand, now Canada’s minister of public services and procurement, once wrote in The University of Toronto Law Journal that it is “the most significant enforcement power that securities regulators in Canada possess.” Nevertheless, that power has been reserved for conduct that rises to the level of “abuse” of investors or the capital markets when there isn’t a specific breach of the law. “Canadian securities regulators obviously have a public interest jurisdiction that might permit them to act,” said Levin, the Faskens lawyer who has more than three decades of corporate law experience on Bay Street. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content ”But history suggests they have been loathe to do so.” However, another securities lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak about the issue, said if the current market behaviour is tantamount to “hijacking an auction market to run a protest,” it could be a good test case. On Monday, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada signalled that the stock volatility could have market-wide implications. The investment industry regulator said in a statement that it is “concerned about the impact the increased volatility may be having on some investors” and will use all the tools at its disposal “to monitor market activity, and ensure market integrity in order to protect Canadian investors.” Without naming popular social media sites being used by investors, such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, IIROC also cautioned investors to “be careful where they get their investing information” in what are largely unregulated environments. “It’s important for investors to avoid potentially misinterpreting investment research and subsequently ‘betting the farm’,” the regulator said. • Email: bshecter@postmedia.com | Twitter: BatPost Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Reddit revolution leaves market regulators with limited playbook — but Canadian watchdogs may have an edge Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Top Stories Newsletter Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Photo by Roaring Kitty/YouTube Article content Keith Gill, one of the most influential voices that pushed GameStop on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, was hit with a lawsuit that accused him of misrepresenting himself as an amateur investor and profiting by artificially inflating the price of the stock. The proposed class action against Gill, who adopted the online nickname “Roaring Kitty,” was filed Tuesday in federal court in Massachusetts. The suit said Gill was actually a licensed securities professional who manipulated the market to profit himself.

'Roaring Kitty,' investor who pushed for GameStop's rise, sued for securities fraud Back to video “Gill’s deceitful and manipulative conduct not only violated numerous industry regulations and rules, but also various securities laws by undermining the integrity of the market for GameStop shares,” the suit said. “He caused enormous losses not only to those who bought option contracts, but also to those who fell for Gill’s act and bought GameStop stock during the market frenzy at greatly inflated prices.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Gill did not respond to a message seeking comment sent to an email address associated with him. Gill became one of the public faces of the GameStop rally that has been a Wall Street obsession this year. The stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds who were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer. Some funds lost billions of dollars covering their positions as GameStop shares surged more than 1,700 per cent during one stretch in January. Article content Broker licences Those gains have largely evaporated since then though, with the stock trading around US$47 on Wednesday afternoon, down from its high of nearly US$350 on Jan. 27. The lawsuit said Gill, who has been written about extensively by Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and others, was far from being an amateur stock picker. Rather, he is a Chartered Financial Analyst who holds multiple broker licenses and was previously employed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. The lawsuit also named Mass Mutual and a brokerage subsidiary of the company as defendants, saying they had an obligation to supervise Gill’s activities in the market. A spokeswoman for Mass Mutual said the company was reviewing the matter and had no comment.

Article content Along with investors, the GameStop rally attracted the attention of politicians, some of whom have called for greater regulation. Gill is scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, along with executives from Reddit, Robinhood Markets, Citadel LLC, Melvin Capital Management and Reddit. “In order to motivate amateur traders, Gill fashioned himself as a kind of Robin Hood and characterized securities professionals as villains,” the lawsuit said. “Gill, however, is no amateur. For many years, he actively worked as a professional in the investment and financial industries.” The would-be plaintiff representing investors in the case, Christian Iovin of Washington state, sold US$200,000 worth of call options on GameStop shares when the stock was below US$100. The stock quickly eclipsed US$400 a share, forcing him to buy the calls back at elevated prices.

It appears that they’re out of luck. Photo by Peter J Thompson/National Post Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through our links on this page. Article content Sometimes, one word can make all the difference. This week, the federal government officially backtracked on its previous position when it announced that self-employed individuals who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and would have qualified based on their “gross” income but not their “net” income will not be required to repay the benefit, provided they also met the other eligibility requirements. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Ottawa changed the rules on CERB repayments — here's what it means for taxpayers Back to video No need to repay CERB Readers will recall that back in December 2020, the Canada Revenue Agency sent out 441,000 “educational letters” warning individuals that they may not be eligible for the CERB. The letters were sent out to individuals for whom the CRA said it was “unable to confirm … employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019, or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application.” The issue of whether the $5,000 income threshold for the self-employed means “gross” income (i.e. revenues) or “net” income (i.e. net of expenses) has been discussed extensively. It has always been the CRA’s view that the $5,000 refers to net income and thus if you had gross income of $5,000 in the required time period, but netted under $5,000 after deducting business expenses, then you didn’t qualify for the CERB and, until now, the CRA’s position was that you needed to return it. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content This week, the government reversed that position and said that self-employed individuals whose net self-employment income was less than $5,000 and who applied for the CERB will not be required to repay it, as long as their gross self-employment income was at least $5,000 and they met all other eligibility criteria. The same approach will apply whether the individual applied through the CRA or Service Canada. What if you already voluntarily repaid the CERB based on the government’s previous instructions to do so? Well, you’re in luck as the government will be sending you back any amounts you repaid, with additional details on how, and when, to be announced in the coming weeks. More On This Topic Amazon has invested $3 million dollars in Canadians learning code – get a head start in this field Overcome the workplace-related stress that 50 per cent of Canadian workers face As podcast revenue hits $1 billion, learn how to get one launched and running But, the question on many other self-employed Canadians’ minds this week is: what about those individuals who didn’t apply for the CERB because their “net” self-employment income was under $5,000? It appears that they’re out of luck. Interest relief For some Canadians, the 2020 tax year may be the first time in their lives that they won’t be getting a tax refund and may actually end up owing some tax. That’s because, just like Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, the COVID-19 emergency and recovery benefits, including similar provincial benefits, are taxable. And, although tax was withheld at source at a rate of 10 per cent of the benefit amount for the three Canada Recovery Benefits (the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit), no taxes at all were withheld from the CERB or the Canada Emergency Student Benefit. In addition, if your 2020 net income was over $38,000, you may have to repay 50 per cent of the CRB payments for every dollar in net income you earned above $38,000 (to a maximum of the CRB received in the year.) Net income for this purpose is line 23600 of the T1 return (with some minor adjustments), and includes any CERB, CRSB and CRCB payments received (but not payments received through the CRB.) Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content To illustrate, assume Mike, an Ontario resident, was furloughed from his company in mid-2020. His pre-COVID income was $18,000 from which his employer withheld $2,200 in federal and provincial tax. He applied and received $14,000 of CERB, for which no tax was withheld. The result is that Mike would owe about $850 in taxes when he files his 2020 return, after taking into account non-refundable credits for the basic personal amount (federally $13,229), the Canada employment amount ($1,245) and the Climate Action Incentive ($300). (CPP and EI have been ignored for this example). Now take Heather, whose 2020 income was $44,000 prior to losing her job due to COVID layoffs. She applied and received six periods of CRB for the final three months of 2020, for a total of $6,000 (with $600 withheld.) But, when she files her return, she will be forced to repay $3,000 of the CRB since her total income for 2020 was over $38,000, and the CRB is reduced by 50 per cent for each dollar of income above this amount (i.e. ($44,000 – $38,000) X 50 per cent). But, what if Mike and Heather don’t have the funds to repay the government by the April 30, 2021 payment deadline? To help taxpayers like Heather and Mike, the government also announced this week that it will be providing targeted interest relief to Canadians who received COVID-related income support benefits. Once you’ve filed your 2020 income tax return, if you qualify, you won’t be charged interest on any outstanding income tax debt for the 2020 tax year until April 30, 2022, giving you more time and flexibility to pay if you have an amount owing. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content To qualify for this targeted interest relief, you must have had a total taxable income of $75,000 or less in 2020 and have received income support in 2020 through one or more of the COVID-19 measures: the CERB, CESB, CRB, CRCB, CRSB, Employment Insurance benefits or similar provincial emergency benefits. If you fall into this category, you don’t need to do a thing other than file your return, as the CRA will automatically apply the interest relief measure for taxpayers who meet these criteria. In addition, the government announced that any CRA-administered credits and benefits normally paid monthly or quarterly, such as the Canada Child Benefit and the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax credit, will not be applied to reduce any taxes owing for the 2020 tax year. The government estimated that the interest relief measure will provide relief to approximately 4.5 million low- and middle-income Canadians. No change to filing deadline Finally, the government confirmed this week that it has not extended the tax filing deadline, meaning that you should file your 2020 return by the normal April 30, 2021 deadline or risk a five per cent late-filing penalty on any amount owing. Self-employed Canadians (and their spouse or partner) should file by June 15, 2021.

Photo by Reuters/Blair Gable Article content Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African-American to earn a PhD in economics, in 1944 observed that Black workers would be the “last to be hired and the first to be fired” unless the economy was at full employment. The economics profession is finally catching up, as policy-makers such as Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem and U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell are as focused on levelling the playing field for marginalized groups as they are on traditional worries such as inflation.

Bank of Canada governor indicates readiness to let economy run hot to include more people in recovery Back to video Systemic racism still blocks ethnic minorities from fully participating in the economy unless white bosses are forced to choose between either confronting their prejudices or missing an order due to a lack of staff. Ancient gender roles force women to choose between careers and children. The long-term unemployed become victims of both atrophy and those managers who are conditioned to prefer poaching active workers to fill open positions, rather than taking a chance on someone who has been on the sidelines for six months. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content History and our own stupid human behaviour mean we continue to leave considerable talent on the bench — or in the stands. As a result, the economy is less productive than it could be, which makes balancing budgets, closing output gaps and hitting inflation targets that much harder. Macklem, who took over as Bank of Canada governor in June, is making inequality the focus of policy, as Powell in the United States and Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank have also done. On Feb. 23, Macklem made it clear that he intends to let the economy run hotter for longer than most mainstream economists would have thought safe only a few years ago, reinforcing both the likelihood that interest rates will remain extremely low for at least another couple of years and that more people will potentially get to participate in the recovery. The reason: to test the bounds of full employment in order to crowd more people into the workforce. Macklem noted that the unemployment rate had been unusually low for an extended period of time before the pandemic, and yet inflation never took off. It could have been a fluke. But in case it wasn’t, Macklem indicated that he and his deputies on the Governing Council agreed to probe the limits of their previous understanding of the relationship between employment and inflation. The pre-pandemic experience suggests the central bank needn’t fear inflation quite as much as it has in the past, which would allow policy-makers a freer hand to stoke economic growth. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Based on past economic cycles, we would have expected inflationary pressure to begin to rise,” the governor said in a virtual speech hosted by the Calgary and Edmonton chambers of commerce. “But inflation wasn’t threatening to take off. As the pandemic recedes and the recovery continues, we will keep that experience in mind.” The unemployment rate dropped below six per cent at the end of 2017 and averaged 5.8 per cent until the governments shut down most of the economy in March 2020 to fight COVID-19. That level is essentially full employment, according to the Bank of Canada’s understanding of how the economy works. That is, when the jobless rate drops that low, economists at the central bank have long assumed that everyone who wants a job would have one and, therefore, growth would be such that inflationary pressures start to build. But inflation never became a major concern during that entire period. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) averaged annual growth rates of about two per cent, which is what the Bank of Canada is obligated to achieve. The relationship between the unemployment rate and prices appears to have changed, so why not try for fuller employment? “There’s a shared responsibility and monetary policy has a role to play,” Macklem said on a call with reporters after his remarks. “If we can all play that part, we can get Canadians back to work, we can grow the labour force and we can achieve a complete, shared recovery. If we don’t do that, it’s going to be an even more protracted recovery. It won’t be as shared, and there will be less potential to grow going forward.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The Bank of Canada is benefiting from a path cleared by the Fed. The American central bank cut interest rates three times in 2019, even as the economy continued to grow. Powell was accused of courting trouble, and he may yet have to contend with a collapse of the stock-market bubble. But the jobless rate had dropped to 3.5 per cent by the eve of the pandemic, the lowest since the late 1960s. Millions of Blacks and other marginalized workers found jobs, and inflation remained dormant. Inequality isn’t as acute in Canada as it is in the U.S., but it’s still an issue. “Some measures suggest that Canada is among the top jurisdictions for inclusion and equity in the distribution of education and skills attainment,” a new report by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship said, “but troubling inequities persist, and many face barriers to the use of their skills in the labour market, leading to stubbornly high levels of income and wealth inequality.” Women in Canada are 17.5 percentage points more likely to have a post-secondary credential than men, and yet the gender-pay gap has barely changed in decades, according to Brookfield’s study. Some 71 per cent of non-Indigenous Canadians aged 25 to 34 have earned a certificate or a degree beyond high school, compared with 29 per cent for Blacks and 40 per cent for First Nations. Macklem’s latest remarks suggest policy-makers are prepared to take these sorts of divisions at least as seriously as inflation. The jobless rate was 9.4 per cent in January, a long way from full employment, no matter how you measure it. “The economy will need support for quite some time, and the bank will continue to do its part,” he said. • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Bank of Canada governor indicates readiness to let economy run hot to include more people in recovery Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Photo by Roaring Kitty/YouTube Article content Keith Gill, one of the most influential voices that pushed GameStop on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, was hit with a lawsuit that accused him of misrepresenting himself as an amateur investor and profiting by artificially inflating the price of the stock. The proposed class action against Gill, who adopted the online nickname “Roaring Kitty,” was filed Tuesday in federal court in Massachusetts. The suit said Gill was actually a licensed securities professional who manipulated the market to profit himself.

'Roaring Kitty,' investor who pushed for GameStop's rise, sued for securities fraud Back to video “Gill’s deceitful and manipulative conduct not only violated numerous industry regulations and rules, but also various securities laws by undermining the integrity of the market for GameStop shares,” the suit said. “He caused enormous losses not only to those who bought option contracts, but also to those who fell for Gill’s act and bought GameStop stock during the market frenzy at greatly inflated prices.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Gill did not respond to a message seeking comment sent to an email address associated with him. Gill became one of the public faces of the GameStop rally that has been a Wall Street obsession this year. The stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds who were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer. Some funds lost billions of dollars covering their positions as GameStop shares surged more than 1,700 per cent during one stretch in January. Article content Broker licences Those gains have largely evaporated since then though, with the stock trading around US$47 on Wednesday afternoon, down from its high of nearly US$350 on Jan. 27. The lawsuit said Gill, who has been written about extensively by Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and others, was far from being an amateur stock picker. Rather, he is a Chartered Financial Analyst who holds multiple broker licenses and was previously employed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. The lawsuit also named Mass Mutual and a brokerage subsidiary of the company as defendants, saying they had an obligation to supervise Gill’s activities in the market. A spokeswoman for Mass Mutual said the company was reviewing the matter and had no comment.

Article content Along with investors, the GameStop rally attracted the attention of politicians, some of whom have called for greater regulation. Gill is scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, along with executives from Reddit, Robinhood Markets, Citadel LLC, Melvin Capital Management and Reddit. “In order to motivate amateur traders, Gill fashioned himself as a kind of Robin Hood and characterized securities professionals as villains,” the lawsuit said. “Gill, however, is no amateur. For many years, he actively worked as a professional in the investment and financial industries.” The would-be plaintiff representing investors in the case, Christian Iovin of Washington state, sold US$200,000 worth of call options on GameStop shares when the stock was below US$100. The stock quickly eclipsed US$400 a share, forcing him to buy the calls back at elevated prices.

A year ago today the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic. Photo by Ernest Doroszuk/Toronto Sun/Postmedia Article content March 11 is the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic and some are betting that we’re on the verge of an historic party. “In the 1920s, after the Spanish Flu and (the) First World War, there was a dramatic surge and you saw things like jazz clubs and ballroom dancing,” Cees ’t Hart, chief executive of Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S, told the Financial Times last month. “After (COVID-19), there will be for sure some bright side in our kind of business.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Analysts at Citibank recommended buying shares in Bumble Inc., developer of the Bumble and Badoo dating apps, which is set to profit from the rich world’s release from lockdown and a growing willingness to share air and swap spit with vaccinated strangers. Let’s keep things in perspective: the death toll from COVID-19 is 2.6 million and counting, and the economic loss has been epic. Canada’s gross domestic product shrunk by 5.4 per cent in 2020, more than in 2009 (the Great Recession) and 1982 (stagflation). Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Statistics Canada on March 10 estimated there were 13,798 more deaths in Canada in 2020 than would have been expected ahead of the pandemic. The agency also observed that while COVID-19 easily explains the initial increase, it doesn’t account for all of the excessive deaths through the autumn. That could be an early indicator that the pandemic is now having an indirect effect on mortality. For instance, Statistics Canada noted a spike in death from overdoses, especially in British Columbia and Alberta. The numbers are sobering, but things could have been worse. The lockdown was met by an equally epic response by governments and central banks. Household disposable income actually increased last year, according to Statistics Canada. Retail sales last June passed their pre-pandemic level. Housing and equity markets are on fire. Government stimulus, near-zero interest rates, the shift to a digital economy, and the imperative to confront climate change have combined to create a powerful tailwind. The possibility that the world is about to relive the Roaring Twenties is so irresistible that Bloomberg Businessweek, The Economist and MoneyWeek have all alluded to the possibility on their covers since the end of last year. It’s taboo in the media business to copy your competitors, so the repetition is telling. Canada’s latest tally of gross domestic product (GDP) certainly roared, surging an annualized 9.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, twice as fast as the Bank of Canada was expecting. The surprise suggests two things: the economy entered the second wave of infections with momentum, and that we’re adapting to life with COVID-19.

Article content Exports of goods jumped 8.1 per cent in January from December, pushing the trade balance to a $1.4-billion surplus, the first since May 2019 and the biggest since July 2014. That’s important because Canada’s trade engine failed to re-engage after the Great Recession. “We’re going to see a surge in demand when we get to the other side of the pandemic, maybe even some inflation,” Linda Hasenfratz, chief executive of automobile-parts maker Linamar Corp., said at a virtual conference hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce last month. “Great economic growth is coming.” The burst of euphoria, when it comes, will make it difficult to assess what we’ve been through during the past year. The focus that went into surviving the pandemic will be replaced by an impulse to simply get back to normal. We’ve suffered a traumatic event and it will be tempting to stop thinking about the crisis and simply enjoy the rebound. Empty grocery store shelves were a common sight at the beginning of the pandemic as fearful shoppers stocked up.

Carlsberg beer and casual hookups aren’t long-term fixes for chronic stress, and a quick return to complacency about the flawed economy we’ve built will waste a rare opportunity to make systemic change. Governments responded to the crisis correctly, but we should be embarrassed that spending of that magnitude was necessary. It was a display of weakness, not strength. “No one should be doing any victory laps for that first quarter; that growth is strong because it’s just pent-up demand,” Mark Carney, the former head of the central banks of Canada and England, said last month in an interview with Nahlah Ayed, the host of CBC Radio’s Ideas program.

Are we creating the types of jobs that are actually going to stick around, as opposed to the types that we wish we had, or that are temporary?” Carney argues that we erred by letting markets determine the value of everything. That philosophy incorrectly assumed ahead of the 2008-09 global financial crisis that self-interested bankers could be trusted to regulate themselves. Governments have spent much of the last decade re-erecting a firewall around the world’s largest banks, and they are now poised to spend the next decade working on policies that will neutralize carbon emissions since the markets won’t do it.

Photo by Screen Shot Weak governance also exacerbated the COVID-19 crisis, beginning with the failure to prepare for a pandemic despite repeated warnings that it was only a matter of time before a novel virus wreaked global havoc. An embrace of tight fiscal policy and relatively low taxes resulted in a sterling credit rating, high profits and an underfunded health-care system that was no match for a mysterious disease.

Meanwhile, the corporate elite plowed as much or more money into Caribbean tax havens than they did into investment opportunities at home or in fast-growing markets in Asia. It was a big shakeup moment. Things are never going back to normal Mary Rowe, president of the Canadian Urban Institute One could go on. The point is that we were entirely unprepared for anything more difficult than a drop in oil prices or a wobble in demand for automobile parts from the United States. “It was a big shakeup moment,” Mary Rowe, president of the Canadian Urban Institute, a Toronto-based charity that works on city development, said of the pandemic. “Things are never going back to normal.” Rowe, who participated in the rebuilding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said it’s too soon to identify the most important lessons of the COVID-19 crisis. The Canadian Urban Institute’s work shows that some cities (Montreal, Edmonton) experienced much higher death tolls than others, suggesting high-level national and provincial assessments could miss important vulnerabilities that are specific to various communities. Hasenfratz observed that many manufacturers, including Linamar, retooled on the fly to build ventilators and other vital equipment, indicating that the answer to concerns about resiliency is to perhaps create an environment in which factories thrive, rather than worrying about reshoring the production of personal protective equipment. Carney advocates a frontal attack on climate change, as the investment required to get to net-zero would create jobs and wealth in service of avoiding a disaster that will otherwise dwarf the COVID-19 crisis. All that and more are on the cards. As policy-makers have been repeating for years now: whatever it takes. • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: CarmichaelKevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: A year on, the pandemic has exposed what was wrong with our economy — and our country Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Article content For decades, Sam Cass, 98, did his own tax return — by hand. But he had to give that up when he turned 80. In a video interview last week from his retirement home in Thornhill, just north of Toronto, Sam explained that tax filing had become too complicated over the years. “It got to the point where I couldn’t handle it anymore,” Sam said. “In the old days, it was a very simple thing. The whole tax return was: What was my income and what was my outcome? Nothing else!” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

'It was a very simple thing': This tax return from 1953 shows just how complex our tax system has become Back to video His son, Murray, was recently going through his father’s files and discovered that Sam had diligently kept all his tax returns back to 1953. They were, indeed, all done by hand. “He had beautiful handwriting,” Murray said. “(Dad) even won an award of penmanship while in school.” Indeed, returns were a lot simpler back in 1953. The four-page booklet that Sam filled out, which we’ll take a closer look at below, had to be either dropped off by hand or mailed to your district tax office.

Article content “It took me two or three hours of concentrated work to do the returns,” explained Sam. Murray, who now prepares his dad’s return along with the returns of some other family members, also did them all by hand until six years ago, when he switched to a tax software program. “My best friend is a tax accountant, so I send him the PDFs of the returns and wait for his OK before sending them off. He always provides some good suggestions,” Murray said. Sam was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, and immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1923, when he was six months old. He earned his bachelor of science from the University of Toronto. In December 1943, Sam, having previously joined the Canadian Army Reserve, enlisted in the army as a signalman in the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. After basic training, all the men Sam trained with were shipped overseas, but Sam was held back and assigned to serve as a radio instructor to future recruits. Few men from his detachment survived the war. Sam Cass, now 98, right, served under the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals during the Second World War, left. Photo by Courtesy of the Cass family After Sam’s discharge in 1945, he went on to do a masters in civil engineering-transportation planning from the University of Waterloo. After graduating, Sam enjoyed a lifelong career in transportation, joining the staff of the City of Toronto as the assistant city traffic engineer in 1950. In 1953, Ontario passed the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act creating a federated system of government made up of the City of Toronto and a dozen surrounding municipalities, encompassing some 620 square kilometres, and Sam found himself at the helm of an agency employing some 1,000 full-time and contract staff. In 1989, Sam retired from the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto as the Commissioner of Roads and Traffic.

Article content Let’s take a look through Sam’s 1953 return and see what’s changed — and what’s remained the same. 1. Income, but no capital gains Sam’s 1953 employment income from the City of Toronto was $5,014, which is equivalent to a salary today of just over $49,000 in 2021 dollars. While he had no investment income to report that year, the 1953 return does ask you to report your interest income, dividend and rental income. Noticeably absent from the 1953 return, of course, is any mention of capital gains, as they only started being taxed in 1972. 2. Exemptions were a good thing On his 1953 return, Sam claimed a total of $2,150 in “exemptions,” including a “personal exemption” of $1,000 for himself, an additional $1,000 for his wife, and $150 for his daughter. Sam would go on to have two more children, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He also claimed $21 in charitable donations. Exemptions were deductions from net income to arrive at taxable income. The exemptions were repealed by the 1988 tax reform and were replaced by the non-refundable credits we have today. For 2021, the federal basic personal amount is $13,808 and is worth 15 per cent, or $2,071. The federal donation credit is 15 per cent on the first $200 of annual gifts, and generally 29 per cent for donations above that. Provincial credits work similarly. 3. A time before RRSPs Sam contributed $250.70 to his pension plan in 1953 and was able to deduct that amount from his taxable income. You’ll note that Sam’s return had no line on which to deduct an RRSP contributions as the RRSP wasn’t created until 1957, when your contribution limit was set as 10 per cent of the prior year’s income, to a $2,500 maximum. And, if you missed contributing for a certain year, your RRSP contribution room for that year was lost forever. For 2021, you can contribute 18 per cent of the prior year’s earned income up to a maximum of $27,830 and unused contribution room automatically carries forward from one year to the next.

An 83 per cent top tax rate Today, we have top marginal rates as high as 54 per cent for the highest income-earners in some provinces. If you think that’s high, back in 1953 the top marginal tax rate was 83 per cent for those with taxable income over $400,000. In 2021 inflation-adjusted dollars, that’s equivalent to income over $3.9 million. 5. No provincial taxes … temporarily Interestingly, the 83 per cent figure was the top federal rate as, in 1953, there were no provincial taxes as the right to levy income taxes was temporarily suspended in 1941 to allow the federal government to collect much needed revenue for the war effort. As a result, the provinces accepted federal grants as a substitute for the right to impose their own direct income taxes. In 1962, the feds reduced their own income tax rates to make room for the provinces to again impose their own provincial income taxes. 6. Foreign income on the radar Back in 1953, there was a small section on the bottom of page 4 of the return called “Income from the United States,” which asked whether you received income from the U.S. on account of yourself or any other person in Canada or abroad. If yes, you were directed to file a special form UST1 as well as a US form 1042. While Canadian residents are taxable on their worldwide income, in the 1950s, few taxpayers likely had any foreign income beyond the U.S. More On This Topic CRA offering to help Canadians through a tax season like no other There's an unexpected way to stay competitive in the finance industry Did you receive CERB?

Article content Fast forward to the 2020 tax return where there’s a question on the bottom of page two as to whether you owned any foreign investment property (excluding foreign property in registered accounts) in 2020 where the total cost amount was more than $100,000 at any time last year. If so, you are directed to complete Form T1135, “Foreign Income Verification Statement.” 7. Of gifts and death taxes On page one of the 1953 return, it asks whether, in 1953, you transferred “any property, securities or cash of a value in excess of $1,000 to any person” and if the total you gifted exceeded $4,000, you had to complete a separate Gift Tax Return. Gifts were on the taxman’s radar because of their connection to death taxes, which were a component of the Canadian tax system for nearly a century until they were repealed at the end of 1971. The gift tax played an integral role in preventing someone from giving everything away prior to their demise to avoid the death tax. Prior to 1941, succession duties were only levied by the provinces, but that year, the federal government starting imposing its own death taxes under the Dominion Succession Duty Act, for individuals who died on or after June 14, 1941. In 1958, this Act was replaced by the Estate Tax Act, which was modelled on the U.S. estate tax system, which exists to this day south of the border. 8. The bottom line In 1953, Sam’s tax bill was $507 on $5,014 of employment income, taking into account his deductions and exemptions, for an effective tax rate of 10 per cent. If Sam’s net income of $4,737 was translated into 2021 dollars ($46,400), his 2021 tax bill (including the basic, spousal and employment amounts) would come to about $3,609, for an average tax rate of around eight per cent.

Article content While Sam was meticulous in his record keeping, you don’t have to hold on to your returns for 67 years. According to the Canada Revenue Agency, you must keep all required records and supporting documents for a period of six years from the end of the last tax year they relate to. When I asked Sam why he kept his returns for so long, he responded matter-of-factly: “As far as paperwork was concerned, I always kept everything.

Article content Ford Motor Co. told employees they can continue to work from home, allowing more than 30,000 to use the office only when they need to, even after the pandemic is over. The “flexible hybrid work model” unveiled Wednesday lets employees choose to stay home for “heads-down work,” while coming to the office for meetings and team-building activities. The system will debut as soon as July and apply mostly to salaried office staff, not factory workers. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

'No more cubicle farms': Ford to let 30,000 employees keep working from home after pandemic ends Back to video Kiersten Robinson, Ford’s human resources chief, announced the move in a global town-hall meeting with employees. It’ll apply first in North America. Like many employers, large and small, Ford is grappling with the reality that workers have grown to appreciate not commuting every day and working among family and pets. Half of the world’s workers now do so from home, up from 11 per cent prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a global study of employers by Willis Towers Watson, a risk-management and human-resources firm. Even after the health crisis ends, companies expect one-third of global employees to continue to work remotely.

Article content “People, to the extent they can, want to work where they want and when they want,” John Bremen, a managing director at Willis Towers Watson, said in an interview. “Companies are seeing that and saying, ‘If we can accommodate that, we will.'” People, to the extent they can, want to work where they want and when they want John Bremen, managing director, Willis Towers Watson In a survey last summer, 95 per cent of Ford’s global nonproduction staff said they wanted to maintain a mix of home and office work after the pandemic. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company finished 2020 with about 186,000 employees. ‘No cubicle farms’ “No more cubicle farms,” Jackie Shuk, global director of Ford’s real estate unit, said in an interview. “We’re trying to make it as easy as possible to be a Ford employee.” Ford will have to carefully manage perceptions since it’s giving flexibility to some employees and not to others. The pandemic laid bare how dependent the society is on the physical presence of blue-collar workers from the factory floor to the grocery counter. But the idea of white-collar employees logging on safely at home, while lower-paid employees risk their health to show up in person, has been an added source of resentment in an already stratified U.S. economy. Companies have found the more flexibility you give to employees, the more productive they will be John Bremen Making employees happy has become a key recruitment tool for Ford, which now vies for tech talent with California’s Silicon Valley as the auto industry goes through a technology transformation to prepare for electric and self-driving cars. “When you start looking at that key talent, and how prime it is right now, we have to become that employer of choice and compete against those tech companies,” Shuk said.

Now, companies in other corners of corporate America are loosening the reins after seeing workers were just as productive — if not more so — while working from home. “Companies have found the more flexibility you give to employees, the more productive they will be,” Bremen said. “Our data show people work more when they’re working from home.” Apollo, Macy’s In the financial industry, many banks are signalling they prefer a full return to the office once it’s safe, though there are exceptions. Apollo Global Management Inc., one of the world’s biggest asset managers, intends to give employees the option to work remotely two days a week, according to a person familiar with its plans. Others, like Macy’s Inc., are still grappling with what to do. The retailer won’t decide until later in the year. “It’s the hottest question that our colleagues ask us,” Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a virtual interview Tuesday from the company’s New York Herald Square location. “There’s just a lot of anxiety around it.” Ford considered requiring employees to come to the office for a specific number of days each week but abandoned that idea in favour of giving them maximum flexibility, Shuk said. “Organically, the employees came up with when it was best to collaborate and, ‘When do I have to do some heads-down time'” at home, Shuk said. “It was kind of forced to have us prescribing” when employees must show up at the office.

The company also acquired a crumbling, century-old train station in downtown Detroit that it’s converting to a mixed-use hub for creating the cars of the future. While Ford remains committed to those projects — as well as a new 2 million square-foot office building going up in Dearborn — the company recognizes it won’t need as much real estate in the future, Shuk said. “Real estate is kind of turned on its ear,” Shuk said. “You’ll definitely have some reduction.

A year ago today the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic. Photo by Ernest Doroszuk/Toronto Sun/Postmedia Article content March 11 is the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic and some are betting that we’re on the verge of an historic party. “In the 1920s, after the Spanish Flu and (the) First World War, there was a dramatic surge and you saw things like jazz clubs and ballroom dancing,” Cees ’t Hart, chief executive of Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S, told the Financial Times last month. “After (COVID-19), there will be for sure some bright side in our kind of business.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Analysts at Citibank recommended buying shares in Bumble Inc., developer of the Bumble and Badoo dating apps, which is set to profit from the rich world’s release from lockdown and a growing willingness to share air and swap spit with vaccinated strangers. Let’s keep things in perspective: the death toll from COVID-19 is 2.6 million and counting, and the economic loss has been epic. Canada’s gross domestic product shrunk by 5.4 per cent in 2020, more than in 2009 (the Great Recession) and 1982 (stagflation). Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Statistics Canada on March 10 estimated there were 13,798 more deaths in Canada in 2020 than would have been expected ahead of the pandemic. The agency also observed that while COVID-19 easily explains the initial increase, it doesn’t account for all of the excessive deaths through the autumn. That could be an early indicator that the pandemic is now having an indirect effect on mortality. For instance, Statistics Canada noted a spike in death from overdoses, especially in British Columbia and Alberta. The numbers are sobering, but things could have been worse. The lockdown was met by an equally epic response by governments and central banks. Household disposable income actually increased last year, according to Statistics Canada. Retail sales last June passed their pre-pandemic level. Housing and equity markets are on fire. Government stimulus, near-zero interest rates, the shift to a digital economy, and the imperative to confront climate change have combined to create a powerful tailwind. The possibility that the world is about to relive the Roaring Twenties is so irresistible that Bloomberg Businessweek, The Economist and MoneyWeek have all alluded to the possibility on their covers since the end of last year. It’s taboo in the media business to copy your competitors, so the repetition is telling. Canada’s latest tally of gross domestic product (GDP) certainly roared, surging an annualized 9.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, twice as fast as the Bank of Canada was expecting. The surprise suggests two things: the economy entered the second wave of infections with momentum, and that we’re adapting to life with COVID-19.

Article content Exports of goods jumped 8.1 per cent in January from December, pushing the trade balance to a $1.4-billion surplus, the first since May 2019 and the biggest since July 2014. That’s important because Canada’s trade engine failed to re-engage after the Great Recession. “We’re going to see a surge in demand when we get to the other side of the pandemic, maybe even some inflation,” Linda Hasenfratz, chief executive of automobile-parts maker Linamar Corp., said at a virtual conference hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce last month. “Great economic growth is coming.” The burst of euphoria, when it comes, will make it difficult to assess what we’ve been through during the past year. The focus that went into surviving the pandemic will be replaced by an impulse to simply get back to normal. We’ve suffered a traumatic event and it will be tempting to stop thinking about the crisis and simply enjoy the rebound.

Carlsberg beer and casual hookups aren’t long-term fixes for chronic stress, and a quick return to complacency about the flawed economy we’ve built will waste a rare opportunity to make systemic change. Governments responded to the crisis correctly, but we should be embarrassed that spending of that magnitude was necessary. It was a display of weakness, not strength. “No one should be doing any victory laps for that first quarter; that growth is strong because it’s just pent-up demand,” Mark Carney, the former head of the central banks of Canada and England, said last month in an interview with Nahlah Ayed, the host of CBC Radio’s Ideas program.

Are we creating the types of jobs that are actually going to stick around, as opposed to the types that we wish we had, or that are temporary?” Carney argues that we erred by letting markets determine the value of everything. That philosophy incorrectly assumed ahead of the 2008-09 global financial crisis that self-interested bankers could be trusted to regulate themselves. Governments have spent much of the last decade re-erecting a firewall around the world’s largest banks, and they are now poised to spend the next decade working on policies that will neutralize carbon emissions since the markets won’t do it.

Photo by Screen Shot Weak governance also exacerbated the COVID-19 crisis, beginning with the failure to prepare for a pandemic despite repeated warnings that it was only a matter of time before a novel virus wreaked global havoc. An embrace of tight fiscal policy and relatively low taxes resulted in a sterling credit rating, high profits and an underfunded health-care system that was no match for a mysterious disease.

Meanwhile, the corporate elite plowed as much or more money into Caribbean tax havens than they did into investment opportunities at home or in fast-growing markets in Asia. It was a big shakeup moment. Things are never going back to normal Mary Rowe, president of the Canadian Urban Institute One could go on. The point is that we were entirely unprepared for anything more difficult than a drop in oil prices or a wobble in demand for automobile parts from the United States. “It was a big shakeup moment,” Mary Rowe, president of the Canadian Urban Institute, a Toronto-based charity that works on city development, said of the pandemic. “Things are never going back to normal.” Rowe, who participated in the rebuilding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said it’s too soon to identify the most important lessons of the COVID-19 crisis. The Canadian Urban Institute’s work shows that some cities (Montreal, Edmonton) experienced much higher death tolls than others, suggesting high-level national and provincial assessments could miss important vulnerabilities that are specific to various communities. Hasenfratz observed that many manufacturers, including Linamar, retooled on the fly to build ventilators and other vital equipment, indicating that the answer to concerns about resiliency is to perhaps create an environment in which factories thrive, rather than worrying about reshoring the production of personal protective equipment. Carney advocates a frontal attack on climate change, as the investment required to get to net-zero would create jobs and wealth in service of avoiding a disaster that will otherwise dwarf the COVID-19 crisis. All that and more are on the cards. As policy-makers have been repeating for years now: whatever it takes. • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: CarmichaelKevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: A year on, the pandemic has exposed what was wrong with our economy — and our country Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press files Article content The Ontario government may not run a balanced budget for nearly another decade, at least according to Premier Doug Ford’s latest financial blueprint, as the economic and fiscal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canada’s most populous province are set to linger for years. Ontario’s 2021 budget, tabled Wednesday at Queen’s Park by Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy, forecasts the provincial government will run a $33.1-billion deficit for its coming fiscal year, following a $38.5-billion shortfall for its 2020-21, which ends March 31.

Ontario budget sees years of red ink to come, as Ford government targets expansion over austerity Back to video The province then projects a deficit of $27.7 billion in 2022-23 and $20.2 billion in 2023-24. A return to a “pre-COVID-19 deficit” won’t happen until 2027-28 under the province’s planning projections, which also show Ontario will not balance its budget again until 2029-30, when its “recovery plan” projects a $900-million surplus. “Significant uncertainty still remains about future economic growth, which may impact these projections further,” the budget states.

Article content Bethlenfalvy and Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government say they are counting on economic growth to help keep the province’s finances sustainable, rather than trying to do so by hiking taxes or slashing public services. The budget includes scenarios for both faster and slower growth, but its baseline planning projections show Ontario’s real gross domestic product contracted by an estimated 5.7 per cent in 2020. The same forecast predicts the economy will grow by four per cent in 2021, 4.3 per cent in 2022, 2.5 per cent in 2023 and two per cent in 2024. Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy. Photo by Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press files Yet the considerable deficits that the province will run for the foreseeable future are further signs of the severe toll that COVID-19 has taken on government finances. The arrival of the pandemic has prompted the public-sector to ratchet up spending to support people and businesses at a time when tax revenues are also under pressure, creating significant shortfalls that governments are bridging with debt. Future governments may find their finances facing greater scrutiny and criticism as borrowing costs increase. For the moment, though, Ontario is focused on fighting the pandemic, not the deficit. “As the pandemic has continued to unfold, people have been very clear that they expect us to focus on two vital priorities,” Bethlenfalvy, a former co-president at credit-rating agency at DBRS Ltd., which is now DBRS Morningstar, told reporters. “First and foremost, they expect us to protect people’s health. And second, they expect us to protect our economy. That is exactly what this budget does.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Commitments in the 2021 budget, the province says, will help add another $6.1 billion to its plan to fight COVID-19, pushing the projected total for the response to $51 billion over four years. Among other spending items, there is more than $1 billion earmarked to support the province’s vaccination campaign and more than $3.7 billion that’s to be spent over two years on a “comprehensive” COVID-19 testing strategy. Ontario parents will get a third round of the province’s COVID-19 child-benefit payments, which will be doubled this time around to $400 per child and to $500 per child with special needs. A temporary 20 per cent enhancement to a child-care tax credit this year is proposed as well, boosting the average level of support for a family to $1,500 from about $1,250. Another $2.8 billion is being set aside to improve internet connectivity in the province. Also in the budget is a new jobs-training tax credit for 2021, which would provide up to $2,000 per person for 50 per cent of eligible costs. A second round of small-business support grants are to be automatically sent out as well, providing firms with an additional $10,000 to $20,000 in support. More On This Topic Fight to attract business investment expected to be fierce, chair of new Ontario agency says When the stimulus stops: Economic danger points to watch for when the ‘punchbowl’ is pulled away Ontario spending ticks up by $2.6 billion amid ongoing pressure from pandemic To try to attract new business investment, the Ontario government is committing $400 million over four years to create a fund that will support its new agency, Invest Ontario, and try to spur spending in the advanced manufacturing, technology and life sciences sectors. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Still, the province’s net debt is predicted to hit $439.8 billion this year, with its net debt-to-GDP ratio forecast to rise to 47.1 per cent in 2020-21, up from 39.6 per cent for the prior year. Net debt-to-GDP will then climb to 48.8 per cent for 2021-22, although Ford’s government says it is aiming to slow the rate of the ratio’s increase and to try to keep it from exceeding 50.5 per cent over the medium term. Borrowing costs will climb higher, with interest on debt as a percentage of revenue to reach 9.8 per cent for 2027-28. Interest on debt expense is still Ontario’s fourth-largest one following health care, education and social services, the budget noted, and is set to rise from $12.5 billion in 2020-21 to $14.6 billion by 2023-24. “We’ve got a war against an invisible enemy,” Bethlenfalvy said when asked by the media about the red ink. “This is what responsible governments do.” Ontario’s total spending will fall by approximately $4.2 billion this year, to $186.1 billion, and hover around that level for the following two years, according to the budget. That prompted comments from the opposition that the Ford government is not spending enough. “This budget doesn’t even mention the third wave, let alone help people through it,” Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath told reporters. However, the government doubling the small-business support grants was “hugely welcome,” said Rocco Rossi, president and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, as firms aren’t looking to take on more debt to survive. Rossi also gave the Ford government credit for providing as much financial guidance as they have. “Unless you know the exact date that the pandemic ends, you can’t give absolute certainty on the numbers,” he added. “But there are real programs to help us confront the pandemic for some time and build some key foundation stones for a strong recovery.” • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Ontario budget sees years of red ink to come, as Ford government targets expansion over austerity Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

Article content A Microsoft Corp. survey of global workers found the majority feel they are struggling or just surviving in pandemic work conditions and a large percentage are considering leaving their employer this year. Meanwhile most business leaders polled said they are “thriving.” A total of 46 per cent of respondents said they are planning to move to a new location this year, a reflection of the greater flexibility to work from home. And 41 per cent of those surveyed said they’re mulling leaving their jobs, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index released Monday, which polled 30,000 people from a variety of companies in 31 countries and used trillions of data points around labour and productivity from Microsoft’s 365 software and LinkedIn network. The data found burnout is widespread — 54 per cent of workers said they are overworked, 39 per cent said exhausted. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Bosses are clueless that workers are miserable and looking to leave their jobs Back to video But the struggles of employees in the midst of the upheaval that has sent many out of their offices to work remotely are being overlooked by their managers and company leaders, who were the only group polled in which a majority said they are thriving. Gen Z workers, those 18 to 25 years old, are faring among the worst — the researchers theorize that their feelings of isolation are higher because they are more likely to be early in their careers and single. While the leaders who are doing well are mostly male, the survey found women, frontline workers and new employees also reported challenges.

Article content “Leaders are out of touch,” said Microsoft Vice President Jared Spataro. “Sixty-one per cent say they are thriving — that’s 23 per cent higher than the average worker, so there is a disconnect there. They’re like ‘this is great!'” Leaders are out of touch Microsoft Vice President Jared Spataro While the study showed the use of Microsoft’s Teams chat and teleconference product is going up, it also flagged that this unstinting growth is draining for workers. Time spent in Teams meetings has more than doubled and keeps rising, meetings are 10 minutes longer on average and the typical Teams user is sending 45 per cent more chats a week, with 42 per cent more of them after typical work hours. “There’s this feeling that all of a sudden the boundaries are gone — ‘my boss somehow thinks he can wake me up at seven and keep pinging me at seven or eight or nine p.m.,'” Spataro said. “We think it’s important for people to recognize, ‘look humans perform better on a schedule.” More On This Topic ‘No more cubicle farms’: Ford to let 30,000 employees keep working from home after pandemic ends Working from home is starting to fall apart, top bankers warn ‘Wage theft’: Employees are working long hours at home — but some employers feel they don’t need to pay them more Working from home made productivity fall at JPMorgan — especially on Mondays and Fridays Companies seem inclined to allow flexibility about remote work even as the pandemic eases in some countries. Job postings on LinkedIn for remote work are up five times and Microsoft said diverse groups of workers are more likely to apply for those positions. But remote work has led to shrinking networks — Teams and Outlook email data show a decrease in messages sent to whole teams, larger groups or groups outside a worker’s main area, and a rise in focusing on a tighter circle of co-workers. The software maker worries this trend can hurt innovation. Microsoft has said it will reopen its Redmond, Washington, campus later this month, bringing back employees who wish to return. Even then conference rooms will remain off limits for the time being, Spataro said. The company has told workers that even after offices completely reopen, they are free to work from home half of the time without special permission.

'No more cubicle farms': Ford to let 30,000 employees keep working from home after pandemic ends Back to video Kiersten Robinson, Ford’s human resources chief, announced the move in a global town-hall meeting with employees. It’ll apply first in North America. Like many employers, large and small, Ford is grappling with the reality that workers have grown to appreciate not commuting every day and working among family and pets. Half of the world’s workers now do so from home, up from 11 per cent prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a global study of employers by Willis Towers Watson, a risk-management and human-resources firm. Even after the health crisis ends, companies expect one-third of global employees to continue to work remotely. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “People, to the extent they can, want to work where they want and when they want,” John Bremen, a managing director at Willis Towers Watson, said in an interview. “Companies are seeing that and saying, ‘If we can accommodate that, we will.'” People, to the extent they can, want to work where they want and when they want John Bremen, managing director, Willis Towers Watson In a survey last summer, 95 per cent of Ford’s global nonproduction staff said they wanted to maintain a mix of home and office work after the pandemic. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company finished 2020 with about 186,000 employees. ‘No cubicle farms’ “No more cubicle farms,” Jackie Shuk, global director of Ford’s real estate unit, said in an interview. “We’re trying to make it as easy as possible to be a Ford employee.” Ford will have to carefully manage perceptions since it’s giving flexibility to some employees and not to others. The pandemic laid bare how dependent the society is on the physical presence of blue-collar workers from the factory floor to the grocery counter. But the idea of white-collar employees logging on safely at home, while lower-paid employees risk their health to show up in person, has been an added source of resentment in an already stratified U.S. economy. Companies have found the more flexibility you give to employees, the more productive they will be John Bremen Making employees happy has become a key recruitment tool for Ford, which now vies for tech talent with California’s Silicon Valley as the auto industry goes through a technology transformation to prepare for electric and self-driving cars. “When you start looking at that key talent, and how prime it is right now, we have to become that employer of choice and compete against those tech companies,” Shuk said.

Now, companies in other corners of corporate America are loosening the reins after seeing workers were just as productive — if not more so — while working from home. “Companies have found the more flexibility you give to employees, the more productive they will be,” Bremen said. “Our data show people work more when they’re working from home.” Apollo, Macy’s In the financial industry, many banks are signalling they prefer a full return to the office once it’s safe, though there are exceptions. Apollo Global Management Inc., one of the world’s biggest asset managers, intends to give employees the option to work remotely two days a week, according to a person familiar with its plans. Others, like Macy’s Inc., are still grappling with what to do. The retailer won’t decide until later in the year. “It’s the hottest question that our colleagues ask us,” Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a virtual interview Tuesday from the company’s New York Herald Square location. “There’s just a lot of anxiety around it.” Ford considered requiring employees to come to the office for a specific number of days each week but abandoned that idea in favour of giving them maximum flexibility, Shuk said. “Organically, the employees came up with when it was best to collaborate and, ‘When do I have to do some heads-down time'” at home, Shuk said. “It was kind of forced to have us prescribing” when employees must show up at the office.

The company also acquired a crumbling, century-old train station in downtown Detroit that it’s converting to a mixed-use hub for creating the cars of the future. While Ford remains committed to those projects — as well as a new 2 million square-foot office building going up in Dearborn — the company recognizes it won’t need as much real estate in the future, Shuk said. “Real estate is kind of turned on its ear,” Shuk said. “You’ll definitely have some reduction.

Photo by Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press files Article content The Ontario government may not run a balanced budget for nearly another decade, at least according to Premier Doug Ford’s latest financial blueprint, as the economic and fiscal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canada’s most populous province are set to linger for years. Ontario’s 2021 budget, tabled Wednesday at Queen’s Park by Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy, forecasts the provincial government will run a $33.1-billion deficit for its coming fiscal year, following a $38.5-billion shortfall for its 2020-21, which ends March 31.

Ontario budget sees years of red ink to come, as Ford government targets expansion over austerity Back to video The province then projects a deficit of $27.7 billion in 2022-23 and $20.2 billion in 2023-24. A return to a “pre-COVID-19 deficit” won’t happen until 2027-28 under the province’s planning projections, which also show Ontario will not balance its budget again until 2029-30, when its “recovery plan” projects a $900-million surplus. “Significant uncertainty still remains about future economic growth, which may impact these projections further,” the budget states.

Article content Bethlenfalvy and Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government say they are counting on economic growth to help keep the province’s finances sustainable, rather than trying to do so by hiking taxes or slashing public services. The budget includes scenarios for both faster and slower growth, but its baseline planning projections show Ontario’s real gross domestic product contracted by an estimated 5.7 per cent in 2020. The same forecast predicts the economy will grow by four per cent in 2021, 4.3 per cent in 2022, 2.5 per cent in 2023 and two per cent in 2024. Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy. Photo by Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press files Yet the considerable deficits that the province will run for the foreseeable future are further signs of the severe toll that COVID-19 has taken on government finances. The arrival of the pandemic has prompted the public-sector to ratchet up spending to support people and businesses at a time when tax revenues are also under pressure, creating significant shortfalls that governments are bridging with debt. Future governments may find their finances facing greater scrutiny and criticism as borrowing costs increase. For the moment, though, Ontario is focused on fighting the pandemic, not the deficit. “As the pandemic has continued to unfold, people have been very clear that they expect us to focus on two vital priorities,” Bethlenfalvy, a former co-president at credit-rating agency at DBRS Ltd., which is now DBRS Morningstar, told reporters. “First and foremost, they expect us to protect people’s health. And second, they expect us to protect our economy. That is exactly what this budget does.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Commitments in the 2021 budget, the province says, will help add another $6.1 billion to its plan to fight COVID-19, pushing the projected total for the response to $51 billion over four years. Among other spending items, there is more than $1 billion earmarked to support the province’s vaccination campaign and more than $3.7 billion that’s to be spent over two years on a “comprehensive” COVID-19 testing strategy. Ontario parents will get a third round of the province’s COVID-19 child-benefit payments, which will be doubled this time around to $400 per child and to $500 per child with special needs. A temporary 20 per cent enhancement to a child-care tax credit this year is proposed as well, boosting the average level of support for a family to $1,500 from about $1,250. Another $2.8 billion is being set aside to improve internet connectivity in the province. Also in the budget is a new jobs-training tax credit for 2021, which would provide up to $2,000 per person for 50 per cent of eligible costs. A second round of small-business support grants are to be automatically sent out as well, providing firms with an additional $10,000 to $20,000 in support.

Article content Still, the province’s net debt is predicted to hit $439.8 billion this year, with its net debt-to-GDP ratio forecast to rise to 47.1 per cent in 2020-21, up from 39.6 per cent for the prior year. Net debt-to-GDP will then climb to 48.8 per cent for 2021-22, although Ford’s government says it is aiming to slow the rate of the ratio’s increase and to try to keep it from exceeding 50.5 per cent over the medium term. Borrowing costs will climb higher, with interest on debt as a percentage of revenue to reach 9.8 per cent for 2027-28. Interest on debt expense is still Ontario’s fourth-largest one following health care, education and social services, the budget noted, and is set to rise from $12.5 billion in 2020-21 to $14.6 billion by 2023-24. “We’ve got a war against an invisible enemy,” Bethlenfalvy said when asked by the media about the red ink. “This is what responsible governments do.” Ontario’s total spending will fall by approximately $4.2 billion this year, to $186.1 billion, and hover around that level for the following two years, according to the budget. That prompted comments from the opposition that the Ford government is not spending enough. “This budget doesn’t even mention the third wave, let alone help people through it,” Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath told reporters. However, the government doubling the small-business support grants was “hugely welcome,” said Rocco Rossi, president and CEO of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, as firms aren’t looking to take on more debt to survive. Rossi also gave the Ford government credit for providing as much financial guidance as they have. “Unless you know the exact date that the pandemic ends, you can’t give absolute certainty on the numbers,” he added. “But there are real programs to help us confront the pandemic for some time and build some key foundation stones for a strong recovery.” • Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Ontario budget sees years of red ink to come, as Ford government targets expansion over austerity Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr In-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.

This week on Down to Business, Frances Donald, global chief economist at Manuflife Investment Management, spoke about a recent report she authored on the economic outlook for Canada. Donald said that the economy may emerge from the pandemic in decent shape, but that Canada still needs to address structural problems that are holding it back, such as the lack of affordable housing, or the lack of childcare. She also said that it’s important for the Canadian government to examine how it thinks about debt: With historically low interest rates, it’s important to invest in infrastructure and other services that can propel the economy in the years ahead.

Photo by Blair Gable/Reuters files Article content Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said her debut budget lays out a “reasonable and sustainable” debt track that maintains Canada’s reputation as a fiscal stalwart. The fiscal plan forecasts a declining debt ratio in coming years once COVID-related spending is no longer needed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s finance chief said in an interview Wednesday.

'Reasonable and sustainable': Chrystia Freeland says spending won't dent Canada's brand Back to video “Canada being Canada, we are proud of our reputation for fiscal prudence and that’s something I would say is built into Canada’s institutional DNA,” Freeland said on Bloomberg Television. “So we are confident the fiscal track we have put forward is reasonable and sustainable.” Freeland, who was appointed finance minister in August, released her first full fiscal plan on April 19, adding more than $100 billion (US$82 billion) in new outlays to already record deficits. Still, most of the new spending will be temporary or one-off measures that will allow for a return to small deficits in coming years.

Article content Women in entrepreneurship, as they scale up, face numerous barriers in the business world, which stem from unconscious bias and a lack of industry diversity initiatives that result in barriers to economic growth overall. It’s a tale that stretches back decades and one that can play a damaging role to our business output, said Jennifer Reynolds, who is president and CEO of Toronto Finance International, a public-private partnership in the finance industry.

How to close the gaps in financing women-led businesses: Report Back to video When women aren’t afforded the same opportunities, “we’re not accessing that whole talent pool,” Reynolds said. “I think that we’re not accessing the innovations that different perspectives would bring us.” The Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, on Tuesday, released a toolkit with some practical recommendations aimed at helping financial backers better tackle the gaps in financing high-growth businesses. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The first recommendation the institute made is for financiers to make their loan application process more flexible and transparent. Financial institutions (FIs) need to create and design loan applications that are more accessible to women. This can be done by hiring a user experience professional well-versed in barriers women face. The UX designer can identify aspects of the application process that can be anonymized to mitigate bias. FIs also need to consider that while more woman are in the labour market, they continue to take on the burden of child care, and allowances need to be made for gaps in careers. Article content _____________________________________________________________ NEW! Sign up now for FP’s lineup of free, in-depth newsletters: Energy, Economy, Finance, Work and Investor. _____________________________________________________________ A second recommendation is to create a concierge service to help women founders navigate the loan process system and facilitate relationships between loan officers. It’s important not to over-burden concierge providers by ensuring adequate staffing and to encourage collaboration between all departments. A third recommendation is to ensure limited partners (LPs) of venture capital firms put their money to fostering intersectional gender equity. That is, tying criterion for financing funds to better inclusion of women and BIPOC entrepreneurs. It also suggests limited partners VCs have more gender and racial parity and expertise in sectors where women, both white and racialized, are likely to be concentrated. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Further expanding on the third recommendation, VCs are encouraged not just to set targets, but to follow through on diversity policies and data tracking. This also ties in with more VCs hiring women, especially racialized women, to expand partner funding expertise. The institute also recommends that VCs, to a degree, standardize the pitch meeting process to make it more equitable. [related_ The report highlighted instances of explicit discrimination towards high-growth woman entrepreneurs. One was told, “I think you’re going to get married and pop out a couple of kids, and I’m not interested in investing in a mompreneur.” Another recounted, “I don’t even know why I’m meeting with you . . . [you don’t look like] you make the hard decisions that need to be made in order to really succeed in business.” To address the sometimes explicit and often implicit discrimination, financiers should consider having other women to participate in the investment process, the report suggests.

This week on Down to Business, Frances Donald, global chief economist at Manuflife Investment Management, spoke about a recent report she authored on the economic outlook for Canada. Donald said that the economy may emerge from the pandemic in decent shape, but that Canada still needs to address structural problems that are holding it back, such as the lack of affordable housing, or the lack of childcare. She also said that it’s important for the Canadian government to examine how it thinks about debt: With historically low interest rates, it’s important to invest in infrastructure and other services that can propel the economy in the years ahead.

Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page. Article content Good morning! Canadians’ insurance bills are the highest in the OECD as a percentage of GDP, according to a new report by C.D Howe Institute. “Canada’s auto, property and liability gross written premiums from 2015 to 2018 amounted to 2.7 per cent of its GDP on average, compared to an OECD average of 1.6 per cent and a G7 average of 2 per cent,” the think tank said in a new report published this morning. All told, Canadians paid almost $50 billion — or around 2.3 per cent of GDP — between 2015 to 2018 in insurance premiums to private insurers for the three main lines of property and casualty insurance: liability, property and auto. Canadians are paying w especially steep price for property insurance on average, accounting for 0.95 per cent of GDP in premium — more than twice the OECD average, authors Alister Campbell and Farah Omran wrote in their report. The policy analysts acknowledged that GDP as a denominator in a cross-country comparison of insurance premiums is not ideal, but other benchmarks were not widely available across the jurisdictions. To strengthen the data, the analysts crunched four years of GDP data to reduce volatility, and believe that GDP captures the wealth of a nation and provides a metric for evaluating the scope of risk-bearing activity. The two policy analysts attribute the high premiums in the country to a number of factors, including Canadians’ innate conservatism and prudence, regulations and government inadequacies. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions requires a particularly high level of capital and reinsurance for insurers choosing to write property risks in disaster-prone areas relative to other developed jurisdictions. “It is possible that Canada’s ranking by this metric is driven, at least in part, by this added price for prudence paid to cover the cost of the extra capital allotted to protect the system from insurer failure,” the authors said. Canadians also pay the highest personal property rates in the OECD as a percentage of GDP, but a deeper dive into provincial rates shows remarkable disparity. Residents of Ontario and Saskatchewan pay among the lowest personal property premiums in the country, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick pay the highest, due to a combination of lower relative wealth and the natural catastrophes that often arrive at the shores of the Atlantic provinces. “B.C., with its high earthquake and wildfire exposure, as well as Quebec with its high flood risk, also show results above the national average,” the authors noted. Finally, Canadians on average pay higher costs for auto insurance than drivers in other OECD nations as a percentage of GDP. But it’s British Columbia, Ontario and Manitoba that are distorting the national average with their sky-high rates. Interestingly, B.C. and Manitoba operate government-run monopolies, while Ontario has a highly-related private sector industry. “This benchmarking analysis would indicate that, whether it is a government monopoly (as in BC) or simply an over-regulated private sector market (such as Ontario), the higher average premiums paid by citizens of those provinces and, therefore by Canadians on the whole (on average), are, at least in part, driven by ineffective government intervention,” Campbell and Omran concluded.

Those with a bearish housing market outlook keep pushing the timing of an imminent collapse forward, but their dismal forecasts to date have not materialized. That raises a question of just when will the housing “bubble” pop? Will it be this year, the next or sometime later? A related question is what would bring about such a reversal in the housing market? Would it be a regulatory change or a market reaction to quickly accelerating housing prices? Another possibility is that an economic downturn in the future brings all markets, including housing, down, write Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis. ____________________________________________________ In 2021, the average bill for Canadian taxpayers came to $3,961, according to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). That can be more than people can pay all at once, especially during the pandemic. If you don’t have the cash to pay off your tax bill this year, you might want to consider using your credit card. Just keep in mind that while paying your tax bill with your credit card does have some benefits, like avoiding steep CRA interest rates, there are some downsides, according to our content partner MoneyWise. ____________________________________________________ Today’s Posthaste was written by Yadullah Hussain (@YAD_FPEnergy), with files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.

Baker Publishing date: Apr 30, 2021 • 6 days ago • 5 minute read • 26 Comments A fast-charging station for electric vehicles stands in the cell phone lot at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images files Article content President Joe Biden’s plan to wean U.S. drivers off fossil fuels requires massive investment in public charging stations to power the electric-car revolution. So far, none of the companies that deploy the equipment has figured out how to make a profit. The dilemma boils down to demand, and there’s a certain chicken-and-egg quality to it. Most electric-vehicle drivers charge their cars at home, so many public charging stations get little use. But lots of people still driving gasoline-powered cars won’t consider going electric until they see charging stations widely deployed, for fear that they will run out of juice on the road.

The electric vehicle charging industry is doing everything except making money Back to video Speculators are piling into the industry, convinced that boom times are around the corner, while short sellers and other skeptics warn that some of these companies will go belly-up long before they figure out how to make money. Biden’s plan to spend US$15 billion to help create 500,000 more public stations by 2030 is feeding the optimism, with investors flocking to EV charging companies since his election. The risk is that the early movers will get badly burned, potentially souring capital markets on the industry for years to come. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “It’s definitely going to require years of investment before they get any return,” said Chris Nelder, who has studied the economics of charging for the RMI energy research institute. Nelder is sure that electric-vehicle charging will eventually be profitable. But when that tipping point will arrive is one of the biggest questions hanging over charging companies. It's definitely going to require years of investment before they get any return Chris Nelder A decade into its existence, the industry is still hunting for a winning business model. Two of the more established names, Blink Charging Co. and Beam Global, made less than US$10 million in revenue last year. That didn’t stop investors from sending Blink shares up more than 500 per cent after Biden’s November win, and while it has come well off its peak the company’s market valuation is still north of US$1.6 billion. Beam jumped more than 300 per cent, though it has lost about half its value this year. The biggest U.S. company, ChargePoint Holdings Inc., just went public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Others including EVgo Services and Volta Industries Inc. are poised to follow. Fuelling cars and trucks has always been a low-margin business, with gasoline stations making much of their money from selling snacks, coffee and cigarettes. The business is even tougher when it comes to EVs. Unless they live in dense cities like New York or San Francisco, drivers do the vast majority of charging at home — their garage is their gas station. They use public chargers infrequently, with most vehicles offering more than enough range to complete daily errands without a topoff. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 80 per cent of EV charging happens at home. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Another vexing issue is the nature of using parking spots to double as charging locations. If a customer pulls into a space in her apartment complex at 9 p.m. and hooks up to buy a few dollars’ worth of electricity, more often than not, she’ll leave her car there until going to work the next day. No one else can use that charger for the next 10 hours, regardless of when her car is done charging. Then there is the relatively small number of vehicles involved. Americans bought 259,000 new electric cars last year, a record according to BloombergNEF, but it’s still just 2 per cent of total car and truck sales. And of those new EVs, 79 per cent were made by Tesla Inc., which has its own branded network of “superchargers” that can’t be used by any other electric car. General Motors Co. said this week that it signed agreements with seven charging providers to make sure its EV drivers will have places to plug in. A Tesla Inc. Supercharger station in Petaluma, California. Photo by David Paul Morris/Bloomberg files Tesla drivers are “close-looped into the Tesla network,” said BNEF analyst Ryan Fisher. “Where is the demand to plug into these other networks? It doesn’t exist.” The Biden administration hopes it can boost some of that demand with the proposed spending, part of its infrastructure plan now before Congress. Some of the money would go toward grants and incentive programs to install chargers, according to a fact sheet from the White House, and some would go toward research into lowering the cost of the chargers themselves. The charging companies are positioning themselves for profitability in different ways. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

A typical client might be a Silicon Valley company that offers its employees free charging at work as a perk. If a particular station gets little use, ChargePoint still gets paid. “I wouldn’t want a driver as a customer, because I think I’d starve to death,” said Pasquale Romano, ChargePoint’s chief executive officer, in an interview. “There’s not a lot of money in electricity.” Other companies, like EVgo, own the chargers they deploy and make money each time they’re used. _____________________________________________________________ NEW!

The company prefers to own and operate as many of its stations as possible, but if a property owner wants to buy the chargers from Blink outright, that’s fine, too. The biggest priority is locking up good sites in high-demand areas, according to CEO Michael Farkas. “Right now, this is a land grab,” Farkas said in an interview. “For us this is about getting as many locations as we can, and we’ll deal with profitability later.” Volta Industries, which plans to go public in a SPAC deal this year, adds advertising to the mix. Its chargers come with 55-inch digital screens. A grocery store can place chargers in its parking lot and bombard customers with ads for specific products inside.

The equipment itself can range from less than US$2,000 for a slower, basic charger to more than US$100,000 for the most powerful models, according to BNEF. Increased production should bring down the hardware costs, but for now, they’re another reason some of the companies struggle to turn a profit. “It’s still early days,” said Colin Rusch, a senior analyst who covers the industry for Oppenheimer & Co. “Like with any early-stage industry, you’ve got to give it some time, until they get to scale.” Bloomberg.com Share this article in your social network Share this Story: The electric vehicle charging industry is doing everything except making money Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Photo by Blair Gable/Reuters files Article content Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said her debut budget lays out a “reasonable and sustainable” debt track that maintains Canada’s reputation as a fiscal stalwart. The fiscal plan forecasts a declining debt ratio in coming years once COVID-related spending is no longer needed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s finance chief said in an interview Wednesday. The nation’s deficit, meanwhile, will also drop to pre-pandemic levels. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. 'Reasonable and sustainable': Chrystia Freeland says spending won't dent Canada's brand Back to video “Canada being Canada, we are proud of our reputation for fiscal prudence and that’s something I would say is built into Canada’s institutional DNA,” Freeland said on Bloomberg Television. “So we are confident the fiscal track we have put forward is reasonable and sustainable.” Freeland, who was appointed finance minister in August, released her first full fiscal plan on April 19, adding more than $100 billion (US$82 billion) in new outlays to already record deficits. Still, most of the new spending will be temporary or one-off measures that will allow for a return to small deficits in coming years.

Article content The budget sees debt as a share of gross domestic product peaking this year, before gradually falling below 50 per cent by 2025. It was slightly above 30 per cent pre-pandemic. The deficit will decline to just over 1 per cent of GDP over that time, from 16 per cent currently.

Freeland defended the spending, saying it was important to help foster the recovery from the crisis. “What we said in the budget was that now is the time that we need to finish the fight against COVID and that does cost money,” said Freeland, who is also deputy prime minister. “We really believe it’s important to invest now in a swift and robust recovery from the COVID recession and to invest in long term growth and that’s what this budget does.” Freeland cited the nation’s strong rebound in the fourth quarter as evidence those efforts to prevent scarring have been working.

Article content Women in entrepreneurship, as they scale up, face numerous barriers in the business world, which stem from unconscious bias and a lack of industry diversity initiatives that result in barriers to economic growth overall. It’s a tale that stretches back decades and one that can play a damaging role to our business output, said Jennifer Reynolds, who is president and CEO of Toronto Finance International, a public-private partnership in the finance industry. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. How to close the gaps in financing women-led businesses: Report Back to video When women aren’t afforded the same opportunities, “we’re not accessing that whole talent pool,” Reynolds said. “I think that we’re not accessing the innovations that different perspectives would bring us.” The Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, on Tuesday, released a toolkit with some practical recommendations aimed at helping financial backers better tackle the gaps in financing high-growth businesses. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The first recommendation the institute made is for financiers to make their loan application process more flexible and transparent. Financial institutions (FIs) need to create and design loan applications that are more accessible to women. This can be done by hiring a user experience professional well-versed in barriers women face. The UX designer can identify aspects of the application process that can be anonymized to mitigate bias. FIs also need to consider that while more woman are in the labour market, they continue to take on the burden of child care, and allowances need to be made for gaps in careers. Article content _____________________________________________________________ NEW! Sign up now for FP’s lineup of free, in-depth newsletters: Energy, Economy, Finance, Work and Investor. _____________________________________________________________ A second recommendation is to create a concierge service to help women founders navigate the loan process system and facilitate relationships between loan officers. It’s important not to over-burden concierge providers by ensuring adequate staffing and to encourage collaboration between all departments. A third recommendation is to ensure limited partners (LPs) of venture capital firms put their money to fostering intersectional gender equity. That is, tying criterion for financing funds to better inclusion of women and BIPOC entrepreneurs. It also suggests limited partners VCs have more gender and racial parity and expertise in sectors where women, both white and racialized, are likely to be concentrated. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Further expanding on the third recommendation, VCs are encouraged not just to set targets, but to follow through on diversity policies and data tracking. This also ties in with more VCs hiring women, especially racialized women, to expand partner funding expertise. The institute also recommends that VCs, to a degree, standardize the pitch meeting process to make it more equitable. [related_ The report highlighted instances of explicit discrimination towards high-growth woman entrepreneurs. One was told, “I think you’re going to get married and pop out a couple of kids, and I’m not interested in investing in a mompreneur.” Another recounted, “I don’t even know why I’m meeting with you . . . [you don’t look like] you make the hard decisions that need to be made in order to really succeed in business.” To address the sometimes explicit and often implicit discrimination, financiers should consider having other women to participate in the investment process, the report suggests.

Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Breadcrumb Trail Links Executive Summary Executive Posthaste: The Big Tech rally is fading — is it time to cash in your chips? The Federal Reserve has been Big Tech's best friend for the past 10 years Author of the article: Yadullah Hussain Publishing date: May 11, 2021 • 3 days ago • 6 minute read • Join the conversation Big Tech had a good run — but is the rally fading. Photo by Jason Alden/Bloomberg Reviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected. Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page. Article content Good morning! Tech stocks around the world have been swooning lately after reaching giddy heights over the past year. Chinese tech heavyweights Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and Tencent Ltd., also known as BATs, fell more than 3 per cent each this morning, while Facebook Inc., Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc. (Google), also known as FANG stocks, had collectively slumped 3.6 per cent on Monday; electric car maker Tesla Inc. had reversed 6.4 per cent yesterday. The market is not off to a great start today either, with Nasdaq futures down 1 per cent this morning. “It seems to be a combination of inflation fears making a comeback and some market participants moving higher along the value spectrum, cutting their exposure to anything with a stretched valuation,” Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at online broker XM in Cyprus, told Reuters. But analysts are cautioning against a mad dash for the exits, given the strong market fundamentals. The global 12-month forward earnings per share estimate has risen by almost 20 per cent over the past six months, which is the fastest pace since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. “Of course, there is a concern that equities have already priced in the improved backdrop given the extent of the rally over the past 12-months,” Daniel Grosvenor, director of equity strategy at Oxford Economics said in a report. “However, although equity valuations do look expensive in absolute terms, they remain relatively attractive when compared to bonds.” Companies that make up 88 per cent of the S&P 500 market cap have reported their earnings in the quarter, with 86 per cent of beating earnings estimates. Aggregate earnings are beating estimates by an astounding 24 per cent, which is the highest reading in at least several years. “The earnings momentum remains very strong and forward estimates are being revised higher. In fact, profit estimates for the next 12 months have risen 16 per cent since the beginning of the year,” said David Lefkowitz, head of equities America at UBS Financial Services Inc. “So, year-to-date, the S&P 500 forward P/E multiple has actually fallen despite the fact that the market is up nearly 13 per cent. The strong results could mean our own estimates are too conservative. Our current expectations are for S&P 500 EPS growth of 31 per cent in 2021 and 12 per cent in 2022.” While inflation fears have been a theme this year, the Swiss investment bank notes that rising costs are manageable — for now. “However, if the cost pressures lead to more persistent and elevated increases in wages, that could prompt the Federal Reserve to start scaling back support sooner than expected, which could create some turbulence in markets, Lefkowitz said, maintaining its year-end price target for the S&P500 to 4,400. The index was trading at 4,152 this morning. Bank of Montreal’s Brian Belski also has information technology as its most heavily weighted sector, and believes vaccine rollouts and stimulus packages in the United States bodes well for the market. “That being said, we believe investors should be prepared for a second half of the year that will likely be weaker in terms of price gains compared to the first half as the reopening/cyclicals trade matures and investors start to digest the market implications of an EPS-driven environment,” Belski noted in a note last week. Bank of America analysts, meanwhile, believe the crash in new economy stocks relative to old economy is reminiscent of 2000/01 post-bubble price action But the Wall Street bank noted that U.S. Federal Reserve is “determined to stoke Wall Street exuberance & Main Street inequality,” and that the “Fed has been Tech’s best friend for past 10 years.” Not everybody is convinced, though. Bloomberg reported that short interest on the biggest ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100, rose 3.6 per cent of the stock outstanding, the highest level since August and up from 0.9 per cent in December. “The spike in bearish wagers stood out in a market where shorts have collapsed amid the S&P 500’s 88 per cent rally since the pandemic trough in March 2020.” The signals are that Big Tech will likely catch its breath — or even fall from its lofty heights — for some time after a stellar run. Investors should react based on their time horizon. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team.

Article content ___________________________________________________ The possible revival of trade talks between the European Union and India could be a positive signal for Canada, which, like Europe, has struggled to convince Asia’s third-biggest economy to embrace freer trade, writes Bianca Bharti. An agreement between the two would be a major development, as it would unite the world’s richest economic bloc with a country that is on track to leapfrog China as the most populous nation on the planet before the end of the decade. Canada knows a thing or two about stalled negotiations with India. The two countries initiated formal discussions in 2010, but after 10 rounds of talks over seven years had failed to produce a breakthrough, the effort lost momentum. Official negotiations were last held in New Delhi in August 2017, although the trade department says several “stocktaking meetings” have been held since, most recently in November. Read the full story here. ____________________________________________________ Nothing ruins an appetite quite like rising food prices. If you’re like most Canadians, your grocery runs over the last several months have been growing more and more expensive. From Oct. 2019 to Sept. 2020, food prices jumped 2.7 per cent, according to the 2021 edition of Canada’s Food Price Report. That’s more than five times what Statistics Canada says was the country’s overall inflation rate during that same period: just 0.5 per cent.

Canadians’ insurance bills are the highest in the OECD as a percentage of GDP, according to a new report by C.D Howe Institute. “Canada’s auto, property and liability gross written premiums from 2015 to 2018 amounted to 2.7 per cent of its GDP on average, compared to an OECD average of 1.6 per cent and a G7 average of 2 per cent,” the think tank said in a new report published this morning. All told, Canadians paid almost $50 billion — or around 2.3 per cent of GDP — between 2015 to 2018 in insurance premiums to private insurers for the three main lines of property and casualty insurance: liability, property and auto. Canadians are paying w especially steep price for property insurance on average, accounting for 0.95 per cent of GDP in premium — more than twice the OECD average, authors Alister Campbell and Farah Omran wrote in their report. The policy analysts acknowledged that GDP as a denominator in a cross-country comparison of insurance premiums is not ideal, but other benchmarks were not widely available across the jurisdictions. To strengthen the data, the analysts crunched four years of GDP data to reduce volatility, and believe that GDP captures the wealth of a nation and provides a metric for evaluating the scope of risk-bearing activity. The two policy analysts attribute the high premiums in the country to a number of factors, including Canadians’ innate conservatism and prudence, regulations and government inadequacies. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions requires a particularly high level of capital and reinsurance for insurers choosing to write property risks in disaster-prone areas relative to other developed jurisdictions. “It is possible that Canada’s ranking by this metric is driven, at least in part, by this added price for prudence paid to cover the cost of the extra capital allotted to protect the system from insurer failure,” the authors said. Canadians also pay the highest personal property rates in the OECD as a percentage of GDP, but a deeper dive into provincial rates shows remarkable disparity. Residents of Ontario and Saskatchewan pay among the lowest personal property premiums in the country, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick pay the highest, due to a combination of lower relative wealth and the natural catastrophes that often arrive at the shores of the Atlantic provinces. “B.C., with its high earthquake and wildfire exposure, as well as Quebec with its high flood risk, also show results above the national average,” the authors noted. Finally, Canadians on average pay higher costs for auto insurance than drivers in other OECD nations as a percentage of GDP. But it’s British Columbia, Ontario and Manitoba that are distorting the national average with their sky-high rates. Interestingly, B.C. and Manitoba operate government-run monopolies, while Ontario has a highly-related private sector industry. “This benchmarking analysis would indicate that, whether it is a government monopoly (as in BC) or simply an over-regulated private sector market (such as Ontario), the higher average premiums paid by citizens of those provinces and, therefore by Canadians on the whole (on average), are, at least in part, driven by ineffective government intervention,” Campbell and Omran concluded.

Those with a bearish housing market outlook keep pushing the timing of an imminent collapse forward, but their dismal forecasts to date have not materialized. That raises a question of just when will the housing “bubble” pop? Will it be this year, the next or sometime later? A related question is what would bring about such a reversal in the housing market? Would it be a regulatory change or a market reaction to quickly accelerating housing prices? Another possibility is that an economic downturn in the future brings all markets, including housing, down, write Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis. ____________________________________________________ In 2021, the average bill for Canadian taxpayers came to $3,961, according to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). That can be more than people can pay all at once, especially during the pandemic. If you don’t have the cash to pay off your tax bill this year, you might want to consider using your credit card. Just keep in mind that while paying your tax bill with your credit card does have some benefits, like avoiding steep CRA interest rates, there are some downsides, according to our content partner MoneyWise. ____________________________________________________ Today’s Posthaste was written by Yadullah Hussain (@YAD_FPEnergy), with files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg.

Article content In a research note entitled, “The Models Look too Good to be True,” Peters & Co. analysts write that Canadian oil and gas companies are close to hitting their debt-reduction goals and could soon start allocating billions in free cash. “For a sector that was in real trouble a year ago, this is obviously a major change and begs the question of how each company will react in terms of allocating capital,” the analyst wrote, adding their models show “most companies” will be able to completely pay off their debts or be in net cash positions by the end of 2025. The investment broker estimates if the current levels hold, most Canadian companies would wipe out their debt or be in net cash positions by 2025, leaving them in a position to start raising dividends and buy back shares to the tune of nearly $110 billion from 2021 to 2025.

Article content Similarly, National Bank of Canada Financial analysts told investors to “buckle up” as they think that rising commodity prices and lower costs have created the “perfect storm for oil and gas equities.” Large-cap Canadian oil companies are trading as if oil prices were averaging US$50 per barrel to US$55 per barrel, “which provides capital appreciation upside of approximately 60 per cent (on average) over the next 12 to 18 months.” The bank analysts believe there is close to 100 per cent upside in Cenovus Energy Inc. shares, followed by roughly 60 per cent upside for Imperial Oil Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. If Canadian oil and gas companies continue to maintain their cost discipline, analysts believe they could offer substantial returns.

Crude stockpiles in China, the world’s biggest importer of crude, have dwindled to the lowest this year. As India emerges from a deadly coronavirus surge, an uptick in local fuel consumption has prompted the nation’s biggest refiner to boost production.

Article content “The fundamentals are strengthening and that bodes well for pricing support,” Scotiabank senior economist Marc Desormeaux said, adding there were a few potential events that could cause an oil price correction, including nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S. that could lead to an easing of sanctions on Tehran and therefore more oil exports. Other risks to oil prices include OPEC increasing production and the outbreak of more variant coronaviruses cases in economies that are trying to re-open as the pandemic wanes. The cartel is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday to decide whether to add more barrels to the oil market.

Article content Global oil demand in 2021 was expected to grow by 6 million barrels per day, with 5 million bpd of that in the second half, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Tuesday’s meeting of the Joint Technical Committee of OPEC+, an alliance made up of OPEC states, Russia and their allies. “Oil prices have doubled in the last eight months and we are in fairly rare territory right now when you think about what oil prices have done so far already,” RBC Capital Markets managing director, global energy strategy Michael Tran said, adding that an oil price rally that rapid has only happened three times in the last 20 years. Tran expects oil to average in the “high seventies” over the course of 2021 with a few short stints above that threshold. He said he’s had to revise his previously bullish oil price assumption of US$58 per barrel for 2021 multiple times as fundamentals continued to improve.

Article content Right now, hedge funds have signed 11 long contracts on oil prices for every one short contract on crude, Trans said. “This oil price environment is a very uncomfortable setup for oil market bears,” he said, noting that more economies are re-opening as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes in parts of the global economy and that is spurring oil demand higher at a time when energy companies have promised to hold production flat. For oil companies, the prospect of significantly higher-than-expected commodity prices is tempting producers to drill as prices rise, though concerns about volatility remain. “There is quite a chance to reach US$100 but we could see again in the coming years some lows as we have been accustomed to volatility,” TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, according to Reuters. Other Big Oil executives share his outlook. “We’re probably going to see both US$50 and US$100 oil, don’t ask me about the sequence though,” Royal Dutch Shell Plc CEO Ben van Beurden said at the same conference.

A cool $75 billion Back to video “We haven’t been able to find any jurisdiction in the world where carbon capture has been implemented, where the national government or the state governments are not very significant partners in that investment,” Alexander Pourbaix, CEO of Cenovus Energy Inc., said in the same interview “I don’t think any of us would ever be in a position to go at this on our own. It’s just too significant an undertaking.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The initiative follows mounting pressure from large, climate-minded investors, many of which have ditched their oil sands holdings. Sitting atop the world’s third-largest crude reserves, the Canadian industry uses carbon-intensive extraction methods that have made it a target of environmentalists. Also at stake are jobs and tax revenues from an industry that represents about 10 per cent of the Canadian economy. “We have one Achilles heel: It’s greenhouse gas emissions,” Little said. “We can bury our heads in the sand and become a victim, or we can actually deal with it.” The oilsands industry emits almost 70 million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide, about 10 per cent of Canada’s emissions, “so we are a big emitter for sure,” Little said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The plan to cut those emissions — which also has the support of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Imperial Oil and MEG Energy Corp. — will include measures like switching the fuels used at oil sands operations and using solvents to haul crude more efficiently. Later on, the industry might employ small nuclear reactors to make steam, Pourbaix said. More On This Topic Who’s afraid of Trans Mountain?

The trunk line will likely cost $1 billion to $2 billion, and could be in operations by the middle of the decade. But the biggest costs are associated with capturing the CO2, ranging from about $50 a ton for industries that emit high concentrations to “several hundred dollars a ton” for direct capture from the air, Little said. The plan doesn’t include so-called Scope 3 emissions, the ones generated by cars, aircraft, homes and factories when the fossil fuels produced in the oilsands are burned by the end consumers.

It couldn’t possibly have as those software, which have become staples of cloud computing, wouldn’t launch until a few years later.

Tech companies want workers faster so they're designing their own microcredentials at colleges, universities Back to video El-Karkri, 35, brought with him several years of experience in the French telecommunications industry, enough to land a job as a senior project manager in charge of projects related to Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) for FXInnovation, which helps businesses with their cloud computing needs. He worked his way up to become the AWS cloud director, responsible for overseeing larger cloud operations within the organization — and in turn, hiring people. That’s when he saw that the traditional education system and the digital economy were operating at different speeds. FXInnovation, a firm made up of 750 people, currently has 37 openings. Finding talent is a struggle because demand far outstrips supply. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The issue with tech, and specifically the cloud, El-Karkri said, is that it’s advancing at lightning speed, while universities and colleges measure time in four-year degrees and two-year diplomas. “When you learn a new language, you will have a new version three months after what you learned,” he said. That’s not conducive to a post-secondary education system that requires years of study before a person is deemed to have the skills necessary to enter the workforce. In fact, by the time a student graduates, what they learned at the beginning may no longer be relevant. The traditional education system and the digital economy were operating at different speeds This issue pushed CEO Guillaume Bazinet to come up with a solution that is being echoed in many post-secondary institutions across the country: industry players are helping universities and colleges design programs and microcredentials to ensure students are up-to-date with the skills or software that are in vogue in the sector. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Sometimes the curriculum and the university are not totally in sync with what the industry needs,” said Valerie Puglisi, who is the chief of staff at FXInnovation. “There’s this challenge when people get out of university that they’re not properly skilled to work.” The challenge has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which not only cut off the pipelines that supplied specialized, skilled workers to Canadian companies from abroad, but accelerated the shift to a digital economy in which tech and computer skills are key. In January, FXInnovation began working with the University of Ottawa on a pilot program called CloudCampus, which launched at the end of May. CloudCampus currently has one microcredential that focuses on developing cloud skills that are highly sought after by the industry. The company tapped about 20 employees, plus a select few from its clients, to participate in the seven-week program that tackles subjects such as Kubernetes and Docker and “infrastructure-as-code,” which uses software programming to manage data centres and cloud networks. El-Karkri is part of that small tester group to iron out any kinks before it’s opened up to the public.

Article content “When I got my (degree) more than 10 years ago, we didn’t learn about Kubernetes or Docker,” he said. “It’s new, so I need to understand that very well to better collaborate with my teams and the client.” At the end of the microcredential program, students will receive a certificate to show they are qualified in those cloud skills.

Article content There are risks, however, in having the private sector help curate the programs at public academic institutions. It makes strategic sense for companies to get involved, but that could be at the expense of developing a more rounded foundation, said Philip Oreopoulos, an economist at the University of Toronto who focuses on education policy. “It’s not obvious from the student’s perspective which option would be better — especially if what they’re learning is the ‘technology du jour’ and goes out of date a few years later,” Oreopoulos wrote in an email. Typically, the tech industry has relied on filling demand for specialized positions with a supply of foreign talent. Fourteen per cent of respondents to the Bank of Canada’s latest quarterly Business Outlook Survey said they would have “significant difficulty” meeting an unexpected increase in demand, among the highest levels on record. Statistics Canada reported last month that companies it groups under a category called professional, scientific and technical services had 47,800 job vacancies in the first quarter, a record. At a more granular level, vacancies in the computer and information systems subsector increased more than 11 per cent during the same timeframe.

Article content For Misheck Mwaba, the president and CEO of Bow Valley College in Calgary, there is what he describes currently as “unnecessary wastage” in the labour market that the tech industry could better utilize. Rather than rely on foreign workers, companies can hire someone from an adjacent field who levelled up their training by taking one of Bow Valley’s microcredentials in data management analytics, he said. “They may not have a computer science degree,” Mwaba said, “but if the company is looking for somebody who can look at data, who can scrub the data and identify the trends, then engineers who have been working in the oil and gas industry should be able to demonstrate that.” Bow Valley College not only offers microcredentials, but works with companies in the surrounding Calgary area to assess what skills the local labourforce lacks and develop programs that span weeks, rather than years, to certify graduates in the skill.

Canadian companies want workers faster Countries that kept women engaged in labour force during the pandemic will rebound faster Businesses are offering economic solutions, so why isn't Team Trudeau listening? Currently on offer are a slew of microcredentials in hot-demand fields of the tech sector that the college developed with the likes of ATB Financial, the Royal Bank of Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. and Calgary’s municipal government. It’s important that the private sector step in to help academia, said Evans Adnani. “Every time I talk to a university, they are waiting and they so desperately want to provide these experiential learning opportunities for students,” she said, referring to DevDegree. The program offers various placements at Shopify to students at select universities, where they go through training and learn the fundamentals of a Shopify developer. “The consequences of relying on a traditional university experience is that we’re putting our future generations at a disadvantage if we’re expecting them to have work experience to start with, so it will be up to industry to start new programs to try to train their employees,” Evans Adnani said. • Email: bbharti@postmedia.com | Twitter: biancabharti _____________________________________________________________ If you like this story sign up for FP Economy Newsletter. _____________________________________________________________ Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Tech companies want workers faster so they're designing their own microcredentials at colleges, universities Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content In a research note entitled, “The Models Look too Good to be True,” Peters & Co. analysts write that Canadian oil and gas companies are close to hitting their debt-reduction goals and could soon start allocating billions in free cash. “For a sector that was in real trouble a year ago, this is obviously a major change and begs the question of how each company will react in terms of allocating capital,” the analyst wrote, adding their models show “most companies” will be able to completely pay off their debts or be in net cash positions by the end of 2025. The investment broker estimates if the current levels hold, most Canadian companies would wipe out their debt or be in net cash positions by 2025, leaving them in a position to start raising dividends and buy back shares to the tune of nearly $110 billion from 2021 to 2025.

Other risks to oil prices include OPEC increasing production and the outbreak of more variant coronaviruses cases in economies that are trying to re-open as the pandemic wanes.

Article content Global oil demand in 2021 was expected to grow by 6 million barrels per day, with 5 million bpd of that in the second half, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Tuesday’s meeting of the Joint Technical Committee of OPEC+, an alliance made up of OPEC states, Russia and their allies. “Oil prices have doubled in the last eight months and we are in fairly rare territory right now when you think about what oil prices have done so far already,” RBC Capital Markets managing director, global energy strategy Michael Tran said, adding that an oil price rally that rapid has only happened three times in the last 20 years. Tran expects oil to average in the “high seventies” over the course of 2021 with a few short stints above that threshold. He said he’s had to revise his previously bullish oil price assumption of US$58 per barrel for 2021 multiple times as fundamentals continued to improve.

Article content Right now, hedge funds have signed 11 long contracts on oil prices for every one short contract on crude, Trans said. “This oil price environment is a very uncomfortable setup for oil market bears,” he said, noting that more economies are re-opening as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes in parts of the global economy and that is spurring oil demand higher at a time when energy companies have promised to hold production flat. For oil companies, the prospect of significantly higher-than-expected commodity prices is tempting producers to drill as prices rise, though concerns about volatility remain. “There is quite a chance to reach US$100 but we could see again in the coming years some lows as we have been accustomed to volatility,” TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, according to Reuters. Other Big Oil executives share his outlook. “We’re probably going to see both US$50 and US$100 oil, don’t ask me about the sequence though,” Royal Dutch Shell Plc CEO Ben van Beurden said at the same conference.

A lot of economic hopes have been pinned on that huge mountain of savings Canadians are supposedly sitting on. Government support during the COVID crisis more than offset the losses of jobs and income suffered when the economy shut down, resulting in a 10.3% increase in nominal personal disposable income last year, according to Oxford Economics. Because we couldn’t spent it, we saved it. The personal savings rate soared from 2% in the last quarter of 2019 to a record high of 27.4% in the second quarter of 2020. By year end that declined to a still-high 11.9%, but rose again at the beginning of 2021, when lockdowns returned. Oxford figures it likely rose further in the second quarter with another round of lockdowns. That sounds like a big stockpile in savings that many believe will boost the economy when COVID restrictions are finally lifted and Canadians are free to spend. But what if that cash mountain isn’t as big as we suppose? Oxford economists Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport argue in a new report that though Canadians’ excess savings seem big, they are actually smaller than we think. Canadians accumulated $184 billion more in savings between the first quarter of 2020 and 2021 than they would have if there had not been a pandemic. But a big portion of that has already been used to pay down debt and invest, the economists argue. Non-mortgage debt declined $22 billion between the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2021, representing 12% of that $184 billion. Another portion went to housing, which saw a surge of activity during the pandemic, with mortgage debt increasing about $132 billion. Still more went to equities. The value of financial assets held by households shot up $720 billion between the end of 2019 and 2021, with a $290 billion increase in equity holdings. Trading volumes on the TSX, TSX Venture and CSE were up 158% in February, 2021, from the year before, driven mostly by retail investors. All told, that shrinks the cash mountain down to about $100 billion, Oxford calculates. Still a lot, but the next question is how much of it will be spent? First off, more than half of the excess savings are held by the two highest income quintiles with only 11% held by the lowest. “Typically, higher-income households have a much lower marginal propensity to consume. With over half of the excess savings held by higher-income households, it seems reasonable that most of the savings will not be spent,” wrote the economists. Oxford estimates that just 13% or $24 billion of excess savings will be spent by the end of 2022. The biggest spending will take place in the second half of 2021, when the economy reopens and government income support expires. Oxford forecasts consumption growth of 6.1% in 2021, up from 5.2% last month, and a 6.2% gain in 2022, the strongest annual gains in more than 40 years. This is forecast to boost GDP by 0.4 percentage points in 2022 to 3.9% year over year. A spending surge for sure, but perhaps not as big as we hoped. _____________________________________________ Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

C.F. Crozier & Associates Ltd., a land development engineering firm based in Collingwood, introduced the program in February after hearing from staff about their struggles to buy a home in the province’s blistering housing market, writes the Financial Post’s Kelsey Rolfe. Rebecca Alexander was one employee who took her boss up on the offer. The 30-year-old had been renting a basement apartment in Collingwood for years while saving for a home. Her search took on new urgency, however, when she was told in the spring that she would have to move out to make way for family members of the landlord. Crozier’s gift boosted her buying power and she was able to win the two-bedroom home seen above — the third she bid on — in one of Collingwood’s older neighbourhoods.

Article content Slap on some sunscreen, inflation watchers, because yesterday’s U.S. CPI numbers were “scorching hot.” Prices paid by U.S. consumers in June jumped by the most since 2008, beating economists’ expectations and, some speculate, testing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to low, low rates. The consumer price index jumped 0.9% in June and 5.4% from the same month last year. Core CPI rose 4.5% from June 2020, the largest advance since November 1991. Yesterday’s data prompted traders to move up their forecast for tightening to early 2023. With inflation, from the Fed “we are told the story is transitory but the increases are going faster and for longer,” John Ryding, chief economic adviser at Brean Capital said on Bloomberg Television. “We just had a monthly increase that was about double what was expected.” CIBC’s Katherine Judge believes that while supply chain disruptions and rebounds from COVID lows are temporary, sustained pressures will emerge with the elimination of economic slack later this year, pushing inflation above 2.5% in 2022. That, she argues, will compel the Fed to raise rates in the second half of next year. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content Automotive supply chains are being overhauled to build electric vehicles, and his Brampton, Ont.-based company will be an important node when they solidify since it has emerged as a leading supplier of one of the most important parts: the aluminum cases that protect the batteries, a tricky bit of engineering.

How Canada can get back some of its former glory as a maker of things the world wants to buy Back to video The cases must be both lightweight to help maximize the distance vehicles can travel between charges, and durable enough to keep the battery from exploding in a collision. “We participate in 50 per cent of the (EV) program launches in North America in a meaningful way,” Caputo, chief executive and part-owner, said in an interview. There’s Tesla Inc., of course, but also Ford Motor Co.’s battery-powered Mustang Mach E, which started selling in Canada last year, Rivian, and he name-drops Daimler AG’s Mercedes and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) for good measure. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “People think of Tesla and they think of EV, and justifiably so,” Caputo said. “But it’s a pretty broad movement. That, I think, is interesting.” Indeed. Canada, home to a handful of big auto-parts makers, has the look of a contender in the contest to build the next generation of vehicles. Nature bestowed on us the minerals needed to make batteries and we still have steelmaking capacity. Can Art makes the aluminum cases that protect electric vehicle batteries. Photo by Courtesy Can Art Aluminum Extrusion Furthermore, Lion Electric Co. of Montreal and NFI Group Inc. of Winnipeg are pushing hard into the market for electric buses, and Quebec’s BRP Inc. and newcomer Taiga Motors Corp. are gearing up to produce e-snowmobiles. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to Ford, General Motors Co., and Stellantis NV’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to underwrite the retooling of factories for EV production. And the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association of Canada, a lobby group, is sponsoring Project Arrow, which aims to build an electric-powered concept car by 2022. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The hype is real. “The growth has been amazing and we’re pretty much in the middle of it,” said Caputo, who a few years ago identified an opportunity to insert himself into the EV supply chain. Caputo, who made a name for himself managing publicly traded companies, had grown tired of the “noise” that comes with trying to please analysts and short-term investors while building a durable business. He teamed with TorQuest Partners, a private-equity company, in 2016 to purchase Can Art, a good company that Caputo thought could be taken to another level. He made a plan to double production to 100 million kilograms of aluminum per year while targeting the most important buyers in automotive, architecture and consumer products. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We went from quotes to proposals,” said Caputo, who is on the verge of meeting his production target. “We designed the future for ourselves and we grew into it.” That plan is paying off, and he can’t help but wonder if policy-makers and industry leaders have an opportunity to restore some of Canada’s former glory as a maker of things that the world wants to buy, which would boost the country’s ability to generate wealth and support better-paying jobs. “I’m not saying a whole revamp of the industrial base,” he said. “I’m just saying, where we have these nuggets, like EV and other things, if we nurture them, maybe it will serve multiple purposes.” Caputo’s thoughts all make sense in the abstract. Now, we just need to keep pace, which will be harder than it seems. Can Art’s experience suggests that Canada’s desire to re-establish itself as an automotive power is short on a key ingredient that can’t be found by digging a deeper hole: manufacturing talent. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The decline of manufacturing over the past few decades has left a dearth of people who know how to make things. There were some 1.9 million factory workers in Canada at the start of 2001, representing about 15 per cent of the workforce, according to Statistics Canada’s monthly payroll survey. That number had deteriorated to about 1.5 million by 2009, which is where it has hovered since, representing about nine per cent of all workers. Caputo said he was only somewhat concerned about inflation, the main topic of conversation in financial markets and the business press at the moment. His biggest worries remain protecting his 500 workers from COVID-19 and finding enough people to keep the factory running at full tilt. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Anyone can play the violin, but not many people can play it well,” he said. “Our people can not only play the violin, they can envision the music.” But Can Art needs a bigger orchestra: the company currently has about 50 unfilled positions at its main factory in Windsor, Ont. “I worry about the availability of skilled tradespeople,” Caputo said. “We always have challenges in that area.” I worry about the availability of skilled tradespeople Anthony Caputo For decades, Canadian kids have been conditioned to equate career success with a fancy degree and an office job. There were about one million people employed in white-collar professions in April, a 57 per cent increase from the start of 2001, more than double the increase in total employment over that period. Manufacturing still employs more people, but the industry’s trajectory has been in the opposite direction: the total number of positions in the industry was 26 per cent lower than in 2001, the year China joined the World Trade Organization and accelerated the hollowing out of American and Canadian factory towns that couldn’t compete with Asia. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Maybe high school guidance counsellors gave up on manufacturing too soon. The Can Art story is a good example of how the right mix of talent and capital can make a go of making things in a relatively high-cost jurisdiction such as Canada. But the company is now growing faster than the pool of potential workers. It’s a problem that also afflicts the red-hot information-technology industry, which has sought to offset a chronic talent shortage through immigration and, more recently, by taking the training of the next wave of workers into its own hands.

Article content There are lessons there for makers of tangible goods, but Caputo also wonders if his industry needs a better story. Can Art “heats aluminum at 1,000 degrees,” so he acknowledges that a job on his factory floor isn’t for everyone. Still, what’s more rewarding: writing code for random video games or building parts for the green revolution? “We’re not software, we’re not very cool, except what we do goes into very cool things,” he said. If that doesn’t work, Caputo might try advertising how much money you can make in manipulating aluminum. The 10,700 people left in this sub-sector of manufacturing made an average of about $2,000 per week in April, roughly the same as stock traders and 10 per cent more than software designers. “You have to pay what everybody else does,” said Caputo. “We do that.” Financial Post • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: CarmichaelKevin _____________________________________________________________ If you liked this story, sign up for more in the FP Economy newsletter. _____________________________________________________________ Share this article in your social network Share this Story: How Canada can get back some of its former glory as a maker of things the world wants to buy Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

A cool $75 billion The oilsands industry emits almost 70 million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide, about 10 per cent of Canada's emissions Author of the article: Bloomberg News Robert Tuttle Publishing date: Jul 08, 2021 • July 8, 2021 • 3 minute read • 16 Comments he setting sun reflects off a tailings pond behind Syncrude's oilsands upgrading facility north of Fort McMurray. Photo by Ryan Jackson/Edmonton Journal files Article content It will cost about $75 billion to zero out greenhouse gases from oilsands operations by 2050, with a good deal of the costs borne by taxpayers and many loose ends yet to be tied up, according to two of the industry’s top CEOs. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content To achieve the goal announced last month, about half of the emission cuts would need to come from capturing carbon at oilsands sites and sequestering it deep underground, which may require as much as two-thirds government capital like in Norway, Mark Little, chief executive office of Suncor Energy Inc., said in an interview. It’s still unclear how and when most of the projects will be implemented, or which agreements will be needed, but it’s clear the industry doesn’t want to do it alone.

A cool $75 billion Back to video “We haven’t been able to find any jurisdiction in the world where carbon capture has been implemented, where the national government or the state governments are not very significant partners in that investment,” Alexander Pourbaix, CEO of Cenovus Energy Inc., said in the same interview “I don’t think any of us would ever be in a position to go at this on our own. It’s just too significant an undertaking.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The initiative follows mounting pressure from large, climate-minded investors, many of which have ditched their oil sands holdings. Sitting atop the world’s third-largest crude reserves, the Canadian industry uses carbon-intensive extraction methods that have made it a target of environmentalists. Also at stake are jobs and tax revenues from an industry that represents about 10 per cent of the Canadian economy. “We have one Achilles heel: It’s greenhouse gas emissions,” Little said. “We can bury our heads in the sand and become a victim, or we can actually deal with it.” The oilsands industry emits almost 70 million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide, about 10 per cent of Canada’s emissions, “so we are a big emitter for sure,” Little said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The plan to cut those emissions — which also has the support of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Imperial Oil and MEG Energy Corp. — will include measures like switching the fuels used at oil sands operations and using solvents to haul crude more efficiently. Later on, the industry might employ small nuclear reactors to make steam, Pourbaix said. More On This Topic Who’s afraid of Trans Mountain?

Article content One of the group’s first big project is to build a carbon dioxide-carrying trunk line along a corridor that links oil sands facilities in the Fort McMurray area and Cold Lake regions of Northern Alberta to a nearby carbon sequestration hub. The trunk line will likely cost $1 billion to $2 billion, and could be in operations by the middle of the decade. But the biggest costs are associated with capturing the CO2, ranging from about $50 a ton for industries that emit high concentrations to “several hundred dollars a ton” for direct capture from the air, Little said. The plan doesn’t include so-called Scope 3 emissions, the ones generated by cars, aircraft, homes and factories when the fossil fuels produced in the oilsands are burned by the end consumers.

Article content I have decided to shut down the website. And here are my reasons for doing so. — safetodo.ca (@safetodo) July 21, 2021 Mattalo started Safetodo.ca on July 14 with the aim of helping Ontarians support safe businesses and as the “second best alternative” to vaccine passports, he said on Twitter. Vaccine passports, or proof of immunizations, have been hotly debated across Canada as the country begins its reopening, even as other countries roll out their systems. Those in favour say proof of immunization is necessary to ensure Canada doesn’t face lockdowns again as capacity limits for businesses and venues loosen. Critics charge that they infringe on Canadians’ privacy and civil liberties. Quebec has signalled it will require vaccine passports for non-essential business activity as of September if the province’s case rate increases. Manitoba has already begun issuing vaccine cards with QR codes to fully vaccinated people, and Saskatchewan’s health ministry said eHealth Saskatchewan is developing vaccine certificates.

Article content Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said the province would not provide any official documentation beyond the printouts residents receive when they’re vaccinated. Numerous business groups have called on the government to reverse its stance. COVID has now become “largely the pandemic of the unvaccinated. But the unvaccinated are not only those who choose not to, but those who, for age or health reasons, simply can’t be vaccinated, and so that puts a significant portion of the population at risk,” said Rocco Rossi, president and chief executive officer of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, which represents 60,000 businesses. The organization has written to the provincial and federal governments in support of proof of immunization.

Photo by Alain Jocard/AP via Getty Images He added businesses have obligations under Ontario’s employment safety regulations to ensure their workplaces are safe. “So the question is, how do you provide safe workspaces in an era where you have both vaccinated and unvaccinated [people]? We believe the best way is to avoid a piecemeal response, which is what you’re seeing now.” Janet De Silva, president and chief executive officer of the TRBOT, said in an interview the board is calling for “COVID-safe passes” for non-essential business activity, which would provide proof someone had either been vaccinated or received a negative COVID test. She said these passes are necessary to ensure small businesses can stay open, large employers can make their employees feel safe returning to the office and communal spaces such as food courts and transit, and business travellers and tourists feel Toronto is a safe place to visit.

Article content Rossi said a proof-of-vaccination system would protect Ontarians’ privacy better than having them share the document they received after their second dose, which includes information such as their partial health card number and birth date. People’s Pint Brewing Company in Toronto was one of the first businesses listed on Safetodo.ca. Owner Doug Appeldoorn said the brewery initially announced on Instagram its workers were fully vaccinated, because they were “very excited” and “want[ed] people to feel they were coming to a safe space. Not everyone can get vaccinated and…the rest of us have to step up and do our part.” On Tuesday, Appeldoorn said, the brewery, as well as Mattalo and other businesses listed on Safetodo, was blind copied on a message from anti-mask group Hugs Over Masks. The email called for the group’s supporters to boycott those businesses. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Mattalo declined to speak with the Financial Post.

While the pandemic certainly improved the financial situation of many Canadians, not everyone has been fortunate enough to build a ‘wall of wealth’. Despite surging home prices that have left many Canadians look fiscally stable at least on paper, many are struggling to make ends meet, according to a new survey. The latest MNP Consumer Debt Index shows the number of Canadians concerned they cannot make ends meet without going into further debt has reached its highest level in three years. Almost half (45 per cent, up 6 points since March) are not confident they will be able to cover all living and family expenses in the next 12 months without taking on more credit, according to the quarterly poll conducted by Ipsos on behalf of MNP Ltd, released this morning. “In fact, the proportion of Canadians who report being insolvent, or unable to pay their monthly bills and debt repayments, sits at the highest level recorded since the index was created in 2017 (30 per cent, unchanged),” the survey noted. “Half (51 per cent, unchanged) say they are more concerned about their ability to repay their debts than they used to be.” For now, the pandemic has helped rein in spending in most households, with the average Canadian family left with $731 after paying all their bills, an increase of $106 compared to the March findings. This may explain why about half (49 per cent) of Canadians feel their debt situation is better now than it was before the pandemic started and are more relaxed about carrying debt than they usually are (45 per cent, -4pts). But that financial buffer may not last. Canadians are also keeping an eye on rising interest rates, with one in four concerned that rising rates would negatively impact their financial stability, and a third are worried that an interest rate hike could drive them towards bankruptcy. Homeowners with an outstanding mortgage feel they are at particular risk. “One-third (32 per cent) of Canadians who own a home say they are ‘house poor,’ meaning that they don’t have much left over after paying bills related to their home,” according to the survey. “All told, approximately 5.5 million homeowners are susceptible to financial disruptions such as an interest rate increase or change to their job situation. Perhaps it is, therefore, not surprising that two in ten (20 per cent) homeowners say they regret the amount of debt they took on to buy their home.” But as the pandemic shows signs of retreating at least in the country and the provinces open up, Canadians are ready to spend on travel and entertainment in a big way. “A significant proportion of Canadians appear to be ready to emerge from their bubbles and go straight into shopping malls, restaurants and airplanes to celebrate the pandemic wind down,” said Grant Bazian, president of MNP Ltd. “For many, the financial damage will likely linger for years even as they regain employment and try to cope with new debts they may have accumulated.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The declines were led by the machinery (-16.9 per cent) and chemicals (-2 per cent) industries, but also in food (-0.6 per cent), non-metallic minerals (-2.9 per cent), and fabricated metals (-1.8 per cent) industries. “A number of machinery manufacturers indicated that the lack of raw materials (including microchips) and delay in shipments affected their production in May,” Statistics Canada said in its monthly report. “As a result, the industry’s capacity utilization rate fell 4.1 percentage points.” Forward looking indicators were also negative, with new orders down 4 per cent and unfilled orders down 4.1 per cent, while inventories rose 0.7 per cent, bringing the inventory to sales ratio up to 1.56 (from 1.54 in April). ____________________________________________________ It’s clear that not only is cryptocurrency here to stay, but it’s also likely to become only more prominent in our lives and financial systems.

Article content Good morning! The global pandemic, tragic and horrible as it has been, has had the surprising effect of creating wealth for Canadians. Not only did many Canadians see their home prices reach new highs, but they also saw their non-residential assets soar during one of the worst health and financial crisis seen in more than a generation. A new report by BMO Capital Markets shows Canadian households’ net worth rose an astonishing $2 trillion during the pandemic. “That represents a titanic 17 per cent increase to $13.7 trillion, equal to 933 per cent of disposable income — up 50 ppts from 2019 levels, and double the ratio thirty years ago,” wrote Douglas Porter, BMO’s chief economist, who crunched the numbers. “U.S. household wealth has also seen a big boost in the face of the past year’s tough economic backdrop, but both the increase and the wealth-to-income ratio are even more overwhelming in Canada.” According to BMO, the average Canadian household now has more than $1 million in total assets, even after accounting for debt. “Household wealth has more than doubled since the past cycle, and tripled just since the dot-com boom at the start of the century — an amazing outcome in the wake of a deep recession,” Porter noted. While housing played a big role, other assets also surged during the pandemic. Currency and deposits, for example, rose $210 billion. In addition, Canadians also rode the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index rally, which has jumped nearly 30 per cent during the past year, while the U.S. markets are also trading at record highs. Equity, mutual funds and ETFs rode the wave of record global stock markets to a $290 billion increase, Porter said, while life insurance and pension values were up $218 billion during the past year. “These have combined to boost household financial assets by more than $700 billion, while net new borrowing has risen a much smaller $112 billion, lifting net financial assets to $5.7 trillion, or 4 times disposable income,” according to the BMO note, published Friday. Finally, non-financial assets rose 21 per cent to rise $1.4 trillion — or at more than 10 times the increase in household debt during that period. Porter argues that the “wall of wealth” has huge consequences for the Canadian economy. First, it eases concerns about household debt, which remains elevated but in many instances is backed by a pile of cash and other assets. Second, while much of the spending splurge is focused on cash held by Canadian families, the wealth of other assets at their disposal suggests a spending boom may not be as transitory as previously forecast. Indeed, sustained spending from splurging Canadians could see inflation lasting a much longer time than previously suggested. The accumulation of wealth by Canadian households would also allow provincial and federal governments to ease up on benefits and subsidies and rollback some fiscal support measures. “Finally, for monetary policy, soaring household wealth and its implications for spending and inflation send a clear message that super-accommodative settings won’t be required much longer,” Porter concluded.

Article content ___________________________________________________ Canada posted a merchandise trade deficit of $1.4 billion in May, following a surplus of $462 million in April. Merchandise exports fell 1.6 per cent (month-on-month), whereas imports increased 2.1 per cent. The picture was even less encouraging after accounting for price effects, with export volumes down 3.1 per cent and import volumes up 2.5 per cent. The decline in exports was broad-based, spanning 8 of the 11 industries. Once more, headwinds in the motor vehicles industry weighed on exports (with exports of motor vehicles and parts down 5.8 per cent). Statistics Canada cited that the impacts of the semiconductor shortage on Canadian auto production were less drastic during the month, but a greater share of output destined for domestic consumers and exchange rate effects dampened exports during the month. ____________________________________________________ Now that some of us are heading back to the office, we may have to supplement our wardrobe, and no doubt we are going to want to get back out there in the “real world.” But a better consideration, a more wise consideration, may be to make some investments, budget for the future, plan for paying taxes (you know what they say about death and taxes!) and generally make sure that money works for you.

A lot of economic hopes have been pinned on that huge mountain of savings Canadians are supposedly sitting on. Government support during the COVID crisis more than offset the losses of jobs and income suffered when the economy shut down, resulting in a 10.3% increase in nominal personal disposable income last year, according to Oxford Economics. Because we couldn’t spent it, we saved it. The personal savings rate soared from 2% in the last quarter of 2019 to a record high of 27.4% in the second quarter of 2020. By year end that declined to a still-high 11.9%, but rose again at the beginning of 2021, when lockdowns returned. Oxford figures it likely rose further in the second quarter with another round of lockdowns. That sounds like a big stockpile in savings that many believe will boost the economy when COVID restrictions are finally lifted and Canadians are free to spend. But what if that cash mountain isn’t as big as we suppose? Oxford economists Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport argue in a new report that though Canadians’ excess savings seem big, they are actually smaller than we think. Canadians accumulated $184 billion more in savings between the first quarter of 2020 and 2021 than they would have if there had not been a pandemic. But a big portion of that has already been used to pay down debt and invest, the economists argue. Non-mortgage debt declined $22 billion between the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2021, representing 12% of that $184 billion. Another portion went to housing, which saw a surge of activity during the pandemic, with mortgage debt increasing about $132 billion. Still more went to equities. The value of financial assets held by households shot up $720 billion between the end of 2019 and 2021, with a $290 billion increase in equity holdings. Trading volumes on the TSX, TSX Venture and CSE were up 158% in February, 2021, from the year before, driven mostly by retail investors. All told, that shrinks the cash mountain down to about $100 billion, Oxford calculates. Still a lot, but the next question is how much of it will be spent? First off, more than half of the excess savings are held by the two highest income quintiles with only 11% held by the lowest. “Typically, higher-income households have a much lower marginal propensity to consume. With over half of the excess savings held by higher-income households, it seems reasonable that most of the savings will not be spent,” wrote the economists. Oxford estimates that just 13% or $24 billion of excess savings will be spent by the end of 2022. The biggest spending will take place in the second half of 2021, when the economy reopens and government income support expires. Oxford forecasts consumption growth of 6.1% in 2021, up from 5.2% last month, and a 6.2% gain in 2022, the strongest annual gains in more than 40 years. This is forecast to boost GDP by 0.4 percentage points in 2022 to 3.9% year over year. A spending surge for sure, but perhaps not as big as we hoped. _____________________________________________ Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

C.F. Crozier & Associates Ltd., a land development engineering firm based in Collingwood, introduced the program in February after hearing from staff about their struggles to buy a home in the province’s blistering housing market, writes the Financial Post’s Kelsey Rolfe. Rebecca Alexander was one employee who took her boss up on the offer. The 30-year-old had been renting a basement apartment in Collingwood for years while saving for a home. Her search took on new urgency, however, when she was told in the spring that she would have to move out to make way for family members of the landlord.

Article content Slap on some sunscreen, inflation watchers, because yesterday’s U.S. CPI numbers were “scorching hot.” Prices paid by U.S. consumers in June jumped by the most since 2008, beating economists’ expectations and, some speculate, testing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to low, low rates. The consumer price index jumped 0.9% in June and 5.4% from the same month last year. Core CPI rose 4.5% from June 2020, the largest advance since November 1991. Yesterday’s data prompted traders to move up their forecast for tightening to early 2023. With inflation, from the Fed “we are told the story is transitory but the increases are going faster and for longer,” John Ryding, chief economic adviser at Brean Capital said on Bloomberg Television. “We just had a monthly increase that was about double what was expected.” CIBC’s Katherine Judge believes that while supply chain disruptions and rebounds from COVID lows are temporary, sustained pressures will emerge with the elimination of economic slack later this year, pushing inflation above 2.5% in 2022. That, she argues, will compel the Fed to raise rates in the second half of next year. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The brewery was one of the first businesses listed on Safetodo.ca. Photo by Provided/People's Pint Brewing Company Article content A website that listed Ontario businesses with fully-vaccinated staff or vaccination policies shut down Tuesday night after the creator said he and the businesses he featured were targeted with harassment. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Toronto lawyer Brandon Mattalo wrote on Twitter that he was shutting down Safetodo.ca, a site he created just one week ago, due to a “small minority” of people who’ve attacked businesses on the site by leaving fake negative Google reviews, making false restaurant bookings and sending hateful messages. Mattalo himself also received a significant number of “personal, directed and hateful” messages, and had to report one to the police. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Website listing businesses with fully vaccinated staff shuts down due to harassment Back to video “I cannot, in good conscience, expose any more businesses to that. Many just wanted to do their business and not deal with this, understandably,” he tweeted. “I hope to maybe find something productive like this in the future to improve our community…but for now, I don’t think it can continue to be this.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content I have decided to shut down the website. And here are my reasons for doing so. — safetodo.ca (@safetodo) July 21, 2021 Mattalo started Safetodo.ca on July 14 with the aim of helping Ontarians support safe businesses and as the “second best alternative” to vaccine passports, he said on Twitter. Vaccine passports, or proof of immunizations, have been hotly debated across Canada as the country begins its reopening, even as other countries roll out their systems. Those in favour say proof of immunization is necessary to ensure Canada doesn’t face lockdowns again as capacity limits for businesses and venues loosen. Critics charge that they infringe on Canadians’ privacy and civil liberties. Quebec has signalled it will require vaccine passports for non-essential business activity as of September if the province’s case rate increases. Manitoba has already begun issuing vaccine cards with QR codes to fully vaccinated people, and Saskatchewan’s health ministry said eHealth Saskatchewan is developing vaccine certificates. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said the province would not provide any official documentation beyond the printouts residents receive when they’re vaccinated. Numerous business groups have called on the government to reverse its stance. COVID has now become “largely the pandemic of the unvaccinated. But the unvaccinated are not only those who choose not to, but those who, for age or health reasons, simply can’t be vaccinated, and so that puts a significant portion of the population at risk,” said Rocco Rossi, president and chief executive officer of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, which represents 60,000 businesses. The organization has written to the provincial and federal governments in support of proof of immunization.

Photo by Alain Jocard/AP via Getty Images He added businesses have obligations under Ontario’s employment safety regulations to ensure their workplaces are safe. “So the question is, how do you provide safe workspaces in an era where you have both vaccinated and unvaccinated [people]? We believe the best way is to avoid a piecemeal response, which is what you’re seeing now.” Janet De Silva, president and chief executive officer of the TRBOT, said in an interview the board is calling for “COVID-safe passes” for non-essential business activity, which would provide proof someone had either been vaccinated or received a negative COVID test. She said these passes are necessary to ensure small businesses can stay open, large employers can make their employees feel safe returning to the office and communal spaces such as food courts and transit, and business travellers and tourists feel Toronto is a safe place to visit.

Article content Rossi said a proof-of-vaccination system would protect Ontarians’ privacy better than having them share the document they received after their second dose, which includes information such as their partial health card number and birth date. People’s Pint Brewing Company in Toronto was one of the first businesses listed on Safetodo.ca. Owner Doug Appeldoorn said the brewery initially announced on Instagram its workers were fully vaccinated, because they were “very excited” and “want[ed] people to feel they were coming to a safe space. Not everyone can get vaccinated and…the rest of us have to step up and do our part.” On Tuesday, Appeldoorn said, the brewery, as well as Mattalo and other businesses listed on Safetodo, was blind copied on a message from anti-mask group Hugs Over Masks. The email called for the group’s supporters to boycott those businesses. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “It included a list of what the business was, where it was, and all of the email addresses for easy copy and paste, just so people can basically send us hateful and harassing emails,” he said. Appeldoorn said Mattalo held a call with all the listed businesses to ask whether they wanted to keep the website active, and after a vote chose to shut it down. Mattalo declined to speak with the Financial Post.

Article content However, after being listed on the website, Earlscourt BBQ received threatening and hateful messages, and numerous fake one-star Google reviews, which the company was able to get Google to take down. “They were all [by] anti-vaxxers who were out to ruin our reputation because we got vaccinated,” he said, adding that he asked Mattalo to have the restaurant removed from Safetodo. De Silva said it was unfortunate Mattalo felt forced to shutter the Safetodo website. But its existence, she said, “signals why it’s important to have something provided by the government. … There are customers out there that want to know they’re safe.” Financial Post • Email: krolfe@postmedia.com | Twitter: kelseyarolfe Listen to Down to Business for in-depth discussions and insights into the latest in Canadian business, available wherever you get your podcasts.

Photo by Getty Images Article content Canadian charities responded to the pandemic by hoarding cash and relying on government support, and most failed to pivot to address crises caused by COVID-19 and economic measures taken to control the spread of the virus, according to a comprehensive report by The Veritas Foundation. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Charities hoarded cash and failed to address crises during COVID: Report Back to video Charities’ cash balances grew to $6.2 billion in 2020, up from $5.5 billion a year earlier. At the same time, following calls for relief for the charitable sector as the pandemic bore down, funding revenue from the federal government grew at a “material” rate, reaching $831 million, up from $641 million in 2019. Why are they accumulating cash and still receiving government subsidies? Mark S. Bonham, executive director of The Veritas Foundation “The magnitude of the increase grew as the COVID crisis lengthened,” Bonham said in the report, which was derived from a review of a database of 29,860 reporting charities, federal government filings for registered charities to the Canada Revenue Agency, and charities’ financial statements for 2019 and 2020, adjusted for those with a financial year-end of January to March when the pandemic’s impact would not have been felt. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The review spanned arts organizations, community and children’s hubs, food banks and poverty relief networks, and included well-known charities such as Plan International Canada Inc., World Vision Canada and the Ottawa Food Bank, as well as dozens of small charities. At the Ottawa Food Bank, the review found, the cash position grew to $12.4 million from $4.2 million, while federal government funding, nonexistent in 2019, clocked in at $962,000 in 2020. “Why are they accumulating cash and still receiving government subsidies?” Bonham said. Bonham further questioned why some charities made decisions to reduce spending on charitable activities while management and administration expenses stayed at the same level — all while the charities were receiving increased federal government funding. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Another charity, Make a Wish Legacy, showed cash of $4.7 million last year amid the pandemic, up from $3.6 million in 2019, with federal government funding of $1.9 million compared to nil the year before. Hot Docs, which supports documentary filmmaking, came second in the arts category with a cash position of more than $4 million, up from $3.5 million in 2019. But it was the organization’s haul from the federal government that was noteworthy, nearly doubling to $951,204 from $490,023 during the pandemic. The federal government introduced a series of supports that were available to charities and non-profits affected by the pandemic to help them retain staff, pay rent and maintain cash flow as more traditional sources of revenue such as donations dried up. The government supports included access to partially forgivable loans under the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), as well as subsidies such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and The Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS). Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Bonham said it is impossible to track how much charities took from these programs because that information is not required to be disclosed by anyone, “charity or otherwise.” While the category of charities aimed at alleviating poverty was “less extreme” in terms of government supports, cash balances still grew in 2020, Bonham said. Plan International Canada, for example, was in top spot in that charitable category with a cash position of just over $68.2 million, up nearly 30 per cent from 2019. However, the 2020 figure included about $43.5 million from the federal government, down from nearly $49 million the year before. Officials at Plan International and the Ottawa Food Bank said no one was available Thursday to provide further context for the higher cash balances and government support. Make a Wish could not be reached for comment and Hot Docs did not respond by press time. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report from The Veritas Foundation, a not-for-profit arm of research firm Veritas Group with a mandate to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of Canada’s charitable sector, noted that it was natural for the charitable sector to respond “defensively” at the outset of the pandemic because, like businesses, charities must consider their operational risks and sustainability. But as the health and economic crisis dragged on and the survival of the charities did not appear to be a concern, the charities took a stronger defensive position — even after the government implemented subsidies for the charitable sector. “While it is to be expected that management would respond to a crisis of this scale defensively by increasing cash reserves, one has to ask if that is the mandate of a charity over the long term,” the report said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Why did the charities not innovate and introduce accommodating operating and granting policies to reflect their changing environment?” That question reflects a key finding in the report: Although the charities were on solid footing, they failed for the most part to pivot to directly address negative impacts of the pandemic, such as increases in domestic violence, racial inequality and mental health concerns. Where public health requirements such as social distancing interrupted services to underprivileged children, for example, the report’s author questioned why charities did not “innovate and adjust its programming to virtual online services, thereby offsetting the decline by increased support through this new, innovative programming?” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report concludes with a more hopeful question about the future: “With the excessive level of cash balances in the charitable sector today, are we to anticipate a surge in charitable activity in the near term as the COVD crisis subsides?” it asks. The report excluded charities directly involved in providing education and those with a religious purpose, and noted some key differences between large and small charities, classified as those with revenue of less than $1 million. For example, the cash positions of smaller charities didn’t increase as much during the pandemic, and they benefited more from government funding. They also had stable tax-receipted gifts from donors while large charities saw initial increases that declined as the COVID crisis wore on. An Angus Reid Institute survey produced with a consortium of charitable organizations last September found that almost two in five Canadian charitable donors had reduced their giving since the pandemic began, and that support for federal government assistance for the charitable sector topped 70 per cent. • Email: bshecter@postmedia.com | Twitter: BatPost Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Charities hoarded cash and failed to address crises during COVID: Report Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

A late-hour resolution between Canada’s border agents and Ottawa Friday evening means another obstacle to international travel has been removed, making way for a late summer tourism boom in the country. The deal comes as Canada began allowing non-essential fully-vaccinated U.S. travellers to enter the country from today — for the first time in 17 months. Even before the border reopening, there are signs that Canada’s beleaguered tourism and hospitality industry is showing signs of life. The Royal Bank of Canada said its customers’ consumption patterns suggest spending on hospitality has returned to pre-COVID levels (2019) in July as Canadians ventured outside their homes. Opening its borders to fully vaccinated U.S. residents will be a boost, but there’s a growing concern that the rise of the Delta variant could stall progress, particularly in parts of the U.S. where vaccination rates are low, RBC economists Nathan Janzen and Rannella Billy-Ochieng said in a note on Friday. “Still, with over 80 per cent of eligible Canadians at least partially vaccinated, another round of domestic lockdowns looks less likely — and much of the travel/tourism recovery to date has been driven by domestic tourists,” the economists noted. In July, RBC estimated that the stock of potential tourists within Canada is around 1 million people larger than usual. “In the 5 years before the pandemic, Canadians spent almost twice as much on international trips as foreigners did in Canada,” RBC economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan wrote in a July note. “Re-directing some of that spending to homegrown tourism activities will help support a recovery, despite a slower expected rebound in international demand.” Major airlines including Air Canada and WestJet have announced new routes, while Porter Airlines said it was planning for expansion. Air Transat also resumed its first commercial flights after six months of inactivity, and immediately targetted new routes. “To meet the sustained demand from travellers wishing to uncover more of their Canada this summer, Air Transat offers an extensive program of domestic flights between Calgary, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto and Vancouver,” Transat said. “This includes exclusive direct flights between Quebec City and Vancouver, a first for the airline.” Meanwhile, Harvest Hosts, a membership program giving recreational vehicle users access to wineries, farms and breweries, said it’s seeing pent up demand drive a large uptick in U.S.-based RVers travelling into Canada. “So far, there has been a 29 per cent increase in requests made for Canadian sites in July — after the border reopening plans were announced,” the company said in a press release. The rebound may already be here: Accommodation and food services sector saw 35,200 new jobs in July, according to Statistics Canada, accounting for just over a third of the 94,000 net jobs gains in July. Job creation in the sector grew 3.7 per cent compared to the previous month, easily the best performing sector during the month. Still, there is a long way to go before the industry’s employment levels reach pre-pandemic levels. “While there were more people working in the industry in July 2021 than in July 2020, employment in accommodation and food services was 18.7 per cent (-228,000) below its February 2020 level in July 2021,” Statistics Canada noted. “Among industries where employment had not yet returned to pre-COVID levels, accommodation and food services accounted for over one-third (36.3 per cent) of the overall difference between current and February 2020 employment.” Paul Ashworth, chief North American Economist at Capital Economics, said that with employment in accommodation and food services well below its pre-pandemic level, there is plenty of scope for further strong gains in employment over the coming months. “The only question is whether shortages will force firms to raise wages significantly to attract workers back?” And that could stall recovery. According to the latest data from job posting service Indeed Canada, listings in the food services sector are up 72 per cent from pre-pandemic levels, suggesting strong demand for bartenders, kitchen help and servers, Bloomberg reported. “Employers are having difficulty finding people willing and able to come into work,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, told Bloomberg. “It’s more of a challenge than normal.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Charities hoarded cash and failed to address crises during COVID: Report Back to video Charities’ cash balances grew to $6.2 billion in 2020, up from $5.5 billion a year earlier. At the same time, following calls for relief for the charitable sector as the pandemic bore down, funding revenue from the federal government grew at a “material” rate, reaching $831 million, up from $641 million in 2019. Why are they accumulating cash and still receiving government subsidies? Mark S. Bonham, executive director of The Veritas Foundation “The magnitude of the increase grew as the COVID crisis lengthened,” Bonham said in the report, which was derived from a review of a database of 29,860 reporting charities, federal government filings for registered charities to the Canada Revenue Agency, and charities’ financial statements for 2019 and 2020, adjusted for those with a financial year-end of January to March when the pandemic’s impact would not have been felt. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The review spanned arts organizations, community and children’s hubs, food banks and poverty relief networks, and included well-known charities such as Plan International Canada Inc., World Vision Canada and the Ottawa Food Bank, as well as dozens of small charities. At the Ottawa Food Bank, the review found, the cash position grew to $12.4 million from $4.2 million, while federal government funding, nonexistent in 2019, clocked in at $962,000 in 2020. “Why are they accumulating cash and still receiving government subsidies?” Bonham said. Rachel Wilson, CEO of the Ottawa Food Bank, said in an email to the Financial Post that the organization itself did not apply for wage, rent or other subsidies from the federal government, but was “automatically allocated” funds by Food Banks Canada through Agriculture Canada’s Emergency Food Security Fund. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Wilson also pointed to a note in the food bank’s financial statements which said most of the $9.5 million in excess revenue generated during the fiscal year was restricted to its operating fund, to meet future needs. “In the last fiscal year, 86 per cent of our expenses were for charitable purpose, well above the CRA’s guidelines,” Wilson wrote in the email. Bonham further questioned why some charities made decisions to reduce spending on charitable activities while management and administration expenses stayed at the same level — all while the charities were receiving increased federal government funding. Another charity, Make a Wish Legacy, showed cash of $4.7 million last year amid the pandemic, up from $3.6 million in 2019, with federal government funding of $1.9 million compared to nil the year before.

Article content Hot Docs, which supports documentary filmmaking, came second in the arts category with a cash position of more than $4 million, up from $3.5 million in 2019. But it was the organization’s haul from the federal government that was noteworthy, nearly doubling to $951,204 from $490,023 during the pandemic. The federal government introduced a series of supports that were available to charities and non-profits affected by the pandemic to help them retain staff, pay rent and maintain cash flow as more traditional sources of revenue such as donations dried up. The government supports included access to partially forgivable loans under the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), as well as subsidies such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and The Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS). Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Bonham said it is impossible to track how much charities took from these programs because that information is not required to be disclosed by anyone, “charity or otherwise.” While the category of charities aimed at alleviating poverty was “less extreme” in terms of government supports, cash balances still grew in 2020, Bonham said. Plan International Canada, for example, was in top spot in that charitable category with a cash position of just over $68.2 million, up nearly 30 per cent from 2019. However, the 2020 figure included about $43.5 million from the federal government, down from nearly $49 million the year before. Plan International said no one was available Thursday to provide further context for the higher cash balances and government support. Make a Wish could not be reached for comment and Hot Docs did not respond by press time. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report from The Veritas Foundation, a not-for-profit arm of research firm Veritas Group with a mandate to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of Canada’s charitable sector, noted that it was natural for the charitable sector to respond “defensively” at the outset of the pandemic because, like businesses, charities must consider their operational risks and sustainability. But as the health and economic crisis dragged on and the survival of the charities did not appear to be a concern, the charities took a stronger defensive position — even after the government implemented subsidies for the charitable sector. “While it is to be expected that management would respond to a crisis of this scale defensively by increasing cash reserves, one has to ask if that is the mandate of a charity over the long term,” the report said. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Why did the charities not innovate and introduce accommodating operating and granting policies to reflect their changing environment?” That question reflects a key finding in the report: Although the charities were on solid footing, they failed for the most part to pivot to directly address negative impacts of the pandemic, such as increases in domestic violence, racial inequality and mental health concerns. Where public health requirements such as social distancing interrupted services to underprivileged children, for example, the report’s author questioned why charities did not “innovate and adjust its programming to virtual online services, thereby offsetting the decline by increased support through this new, innovative programming?” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report concludes with a more hopeful question about the future: “With the excessive level of cash balances in the charitable sector today, are we to anticipate a surge in charitable activity in the near term as the COVD crisis subsides?” it asks. The report excluded charities directly involved in providing education and those with a religious purpose, and noted some key differences between large and small charities, classified as those with revenue of less than $1 million. For example, the cash positions of smaller charities didn’t increase as much during the pandemic, and they benefited more from government funding. They also had stable tax-receipted gifts from donors while large charities saw initial increases that declined as the COVID crisis wore on. An Angus Reid Institute survey produced with a consortium of charitable organizations last September found that almost two in five Canadian charitable donors had reduced their giving since the pandemic began, and that support for federal government assistance for the charitable sector topped 70 per cent. • Email: bshecter@postmedia.com | Twitter: BatPost Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Charities hoarded cash and failed to address crises during COVID: Report Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The rise of indoor farming is exploding, but Canada is lagging behind Back to video Many industry experts say this vision of a thriving controlled environment agriculture sector, as it’s formally known, is not only a nice idea, but necessary, especially if climate catastrophes start to pose more and more challenges for field crops. Some experts are even warning that weaning Canada off imported produce is a matter of national security, given recent events such as the extreme drought this summer that has devastated crops in California, which the country has historically depended on for billions-of-dollars worth of fruits and vegetables each year. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Despite the stakes, however, the growth of Canada’s nascent indoor farming sector is lagging behind other countries, amid concerns that major investors and governments here haven’t fully bought into the promise of vertical farming, or the technology that enables it. Without that support, the sector might not become the sort of global powerhouse that could export indoor-farming hardware, software and intellectual property. The market for closed environment agriculture is a potentially lucrative one, with revenue expected to exceed US$170 billion in 2025, up from roughly US$74.5 billion last year, according to a report from KD Market Insights. “The trick is, if you’re doing this right, you’re not just selling the lettuce, you can also sell the technology all over the world,” said Lenore Newman, director of the Food and Agriculture Institute at the University of the Fraser Valley.

Photo by University of the Fraser Valley Her “holy grail” has Canadian companies developing indoor farming systems so successfully that they can be marketed as a farm in a box — the sort of thing you “put on a truck, drop off and start growing.” It isn’t as simple as it sounds. Vertical farming — the most buzzed-about method in controlled environment agriculture — features warehouses stacked several storeys high, with irrigation and lighting systems, and robots that pick and transport crops from one area to another. But the company that manages to get all that right will have more than a farm in a box, Newman said. It will be able to collect data from its growing list of client operations that will allow it to further perfect its formulas. “Every single plant is being monitored,” she said. “The data itself is incredibly valuable.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content For example, if a particular strawberry plant is outproducing others due to a slight change in conditions, a company can use that to its advantage. The optimal number of plants and stacks, the most effective configuration of LED lamps, and the recipes for soil and hydroponic liquid can all become precious IP.

Photo by Thibault Savary/AFP via Getty Images Vancouver-based CubicFarm Systems Corp. is one of Canada’s leading indoor agriculture technology firms, selling a system that grows salad greens, and another one that grows livestock feed. Chief executive Dave Dinesen said a prospective indoor farmer would need access to roughly $25 million in capital and about five acres of space for one of the company’s systems. Even with enough capital and space, farmers can still run into problems. One of the more glaring signs that the country isn’t keeping up with the pace of change in agriculture has to do with zoning laws.

Article content It makes the most sense to build such facilities on agricultural land, because that’s the cheapest kind — and one of the main goals is to compete with lower-priced field-grown crops. But some jurisdictions don’t recognize indoor farming as, well, farming, so getting approval to put a facility on land zoned for agriculture can be complicated. “There’s often not a box to tick for permits,” Dinesen said. “Why aren’t we going all in on localizing as much food production as possible, with policy, grants, incentives?” Indoor farm operators can build facilities on more expensive industrial land, which might make sense to some, but Dinesen said the idea of a farm in the middle of an urban area just isn’t viable. “It’s another one of these romantic notions that has to be dispelled,” he said. “This is still farming. You want to find the least expensive agricultural land, put up buildings for as low a cost as possible.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content CubicFarm’s systems are also getting larger and larger, so it makes sense to build them near a main distribution hub outside a city to further cut down on transport. “I don’t think the solution is hundreds of people having small farms, selling their stuff at a farmers’ market. That’s romantic. It’s not going to replace California. Never,” Dinesen said. “Large retail groups, large food service, they don’t want 1,000 suppliers for their salad products. They want five. That’s what we’re focused on.” Newman said a lot of the problems facing the indoor farming sector come up because it’s been around for less than a decade. “You start to run into these weird problems. Your thing is so new that it doesn’t fit into what people expect farming to look like,” she said. “There’s kind of a philosophical question of, ‘What is a farmer and what is a farm?’” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Waiting for regional regulators to sort through those questions can be a problem for cash-strapped startups. “It’s pushing the boundary of what a farmer is, and, yeah, we have to make sure our zoning reflects that, especially if we want to be a leader,” Newman said. “The problem is it takes time … They’re burning capital while they’re waiting.” Meanwhile, Canada is lagging behind the leaders in this space — including the Netherlands, Israel, the United States and Singapore — which have helped grow their domestic indoor agricultural tech sectors using a raft of grants and incentives. The trick is, if you’re doing this right, you’re not just selling the lettuce, you can also sell the technology all over the world Lenore Newman To be sure, some big investments into the next generation of vertical farming have been made in Canada, including a $65-million investment in a commercial vertical farming company by French fry empire McCain Foods Ltd. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The Quebec provincial government has also invested in the sector as part of its push to become more self-sufficient in food production, including earmarking $91 million to double the volume of its indoor production of fruit and vegetables. The federal agriculture department said some support is already provided for indoor farming through several funding programs for the development of agricultural innovation and clean energy technology. Ottawa is also involved in a pilot project that is operating a vertical farm in Nunavut. In the private sector, there has been a “tsunami of investment capital” in North American ag-tech, said Steve Hansen, an analyst at Raymond James Ltd. who follows the industry. But large, traditional lenders haven’t been as forthcoming with seed money to get these operations and tech developers on their feet, mostly because the farms aren’t profitable yet. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content High energy costs, along with the cost of the facilities themselves, mean the farms have to reach a significant scale before they start to become economically viable. “There’s a lot of skepticism about whether that’s going to be capital well spent,” Hansen said. “It’s still very difficult for some of these groups to get financing.” That’s a problem considering how expensive these new farms are to build. Canadian companies also haven’t seen a high level of coordinated government support, and often don’t get the sort of funding afforded to traditional farmers, Hansen said. One of the reasons for the slow start could be that farmers, tech developers, investors, academics, bankers and government agencies aren’t mingling in the same place. Without that healthy “ecosystem,” as Hansen calls it — where players at different ends of the business know each other and work together — it’s harder for a young industry to mature.

Ottawa has worked to build ecosystems in other sectors with its supercluster program: a group of independent government corporations set up to help startups, fund research and champion innovation in five promising industries with the goal of developing Silicon Valley-style centres of excellence. Protein Industries Canada, one of the most notable superclusters, has been pushing to establish the farming and food processing industry as a global leader in manufacturing ingredients for the fast-growing plant-based protein market. Hansen and others suggested that indoor farming could benefit from its own supercluster program. “Why aren’t there six?” asked John Hartnett, who leads SVG Ventures LLC, a Silicon Valley-based venture-capital firm focused on agriculture technology. “There needs to be the vision first, to say that this is important for the future of Canada. To me, that needs to start at the top.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

But now that this is gathering pace, now that there are billions of dollars invested in this space, it’s de-risked some of the concerns that there might have been.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Canadians' confidence plunges the most since the darkest days of the pandemic Back to video The weakening sentiment among households could undermine what has been a big advantage for Trudeau heading into the Sept. 20 election. For much of this year until now, Canadians have been been feeling good about the economy and their finances. Already, Trudeau and his incumbent team have lost their lead in the polls to the main opposition Conservatives under Leader Erin O’Toole, who is running low-key campaign focused on the complete platform his party released out of the gates. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Trudeau, meanwhile, got off to a rocky start after seeking the dissolution of parliament on the day Kabul fell to the Taliban ahead of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. His campaign was also sideswiped by an inflation report that showed consumer prices increasing at the fastest pace in a decade. The Liberals have the support of 32 per cent of voters compared to 33 per cent for the Conservatives and 20 per cent for the left-leaning New Democratic Party, according to national polling averages compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The good news for Trudeau is that consumer sentiment is still at high levels. The confidence index is about 10 per cent above its historical average. But it’s trending in the wrong direction, potentially reflecting growing worries about the highly transmissible delta variant and a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past seven days, new daily cases averaged almost 3,000, the highest level since May.

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Macklem used a speech on Thursday to chart an end to the Bank of Canada’s first use of quantitative easing (QE), a relatively aggressive approach to keeping interest rates low that involves central banks using their unique ability to create money to purchase financial assets.

Tiff Macklem charts Bank of Canada's path out of pandemic stimulus Back to video The Bank of Canada deployed QE to fight the COVID-19 recession, and has so far acquired more than $330 billion of Government of Canada debt since the end of March 2020. Central bankers dislike becoming active players in private markets, but without their intervention, the cost of borrowing money to invest probably would drift higher, slowing the recovery. “As the recovery progresses, we are moving closer to a time when continuing to add stimulus through QE will no longer be necessary,” Macklem said in remarks prepared for an event hosted by Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec. “We are not there yet. That timing is a monetary policy decision that will depend on economic developments.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The recession that the pandemic triggered is over, but the recovery remains well short of Macklem’s goals. For example, the labour underutilization rate — an indicator that combines the jobless rate with the number of potential workers who aren’t looking for jobs and employed people who worked less than half their usual number of hours — was 14.4 per cent in July, down from 34.8 per cent in May 2020, but still higher than 11.4 per cent in February 2020. Also, gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of about one per cent in the second quarter, a decline that Macklem described as “more pronounced that we anticipated.” Indeed: forecasters, including the Bank of Canada, had predicted an increase. The Bank of Canada expects “strong” growth over the second half of the year, but policy-makers nonetheless opted to leave the benchmark lending rate pinned near zero at the end of their latest round of policy deliberations on Sept. 8. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content They also said they would continue to purchase federal debt at a pace of about $2 billion per week. Bay Street economists and the bond traders they advise are now trying to figure out when policy-makers will taper that amount to zero. Macklem offered no clues about when that will happen, but he did provide a path that should allow market participants plenty of time to figure it out. More On This Topic Bank of Canada sees recovery on track, stays course on policy What's next for the Canadian economy and the loonie after GDP shocker 'A longer road to recovery:' Canada's economy shrinks, catching economists by surprise The end of QE won’t mean the end of the Bank of Canada’s active participation at bond auctions. Macklem said the central bank will pivot to a “reinvestment phase” that will use the proceeds of maturing securities to maintain the Bank of Canada’s portfolio at current levels. The governor said those purchases likely will average about $1 billion per week. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “When we arrive at the reinvestment phase, we will communicate this monetary policy decision clearly,” he said. “When we get to the reinvestment phase and how long we are in it are monetary policy decisions that will depend on the strength of the recovery and the evolution of inflation.” Prices represent the biggest wildcard. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 3.7 per cent in July from a year earlier, matching the biggest gain in a decade. Macklem reiterated that he thinks most of the upward pressure on inflation is the result of temporary factors related to the pandemic, but he conceded that he can’t be sure of that. The central bank’s target for inflation is two per cent, so it can’t tolerate price increases at current levels forever, which is why some Bay Street analysts think policymakers could taper QE as early as next month. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Macklem didn’t close the door on that possibility, emphasizing the reinvestment phase should also be seen as stimulus because it will keep an elevated amount of money in the financial system. He reiterated that he intends to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged until the second half of next year, but made clear that there was no link between the decision about when to raise the interest rate and when to reduce the size of the Bank of Canada’s crisis-era bond holdings. “Eventually, the reinvestment phase will end, and we will stop purchasing bonds to replace the ones that are maturing,” Macklem said. “It is reasonable to expect that when we do eventually need to reduce monetary stimulus, our first move will be to raise the target for the overnight rate — our policy interest rate.” • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Tiff Macklem charts Bank of Canada's path out of pandemic stimulus Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Since the start of the year, the six-year-old company has brought in revenue of about $250,000, all of it from Canada. Zahra intends to change that. His growth strategy heavily relies on international sales and Africa is among the first places where he’s put down a marker, a decision that might hint at a shift in Canada’s thinking about a continent that imports a quarter-trillion-dollars worth of goods.

The Liberal platform states the party would develop a strategy of “economic co-operation” to support the recently ratified African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), increase infrastructure investment and expand partnerships in research and innovation. Conservatives say they would partly reorient Canadian supply chains to Africa and “fully engage” with the 54 members of AfCFTA, “particularly in infrastructure, energy transition, technology, minerals, and food security partnerships.” They also plan to pursue an intelligence-sharing partnership with the African Union and establish “strategic outlooks” with a select few countries.

Between 2001 and 2018, Africa imported US$250-billion worth of goods, but, so far, the European Union and China are reaping the rewards of that expansion, supplying US$140 billion and US$100 billion of those imports, respectively, Ciuriak said.

Article content “Canada went from $1 billion exports (in 2001) to more than $3 billion (in 2018), which is great in terms of percentage growth, but it was peanuts in terms of the share of the overall pie,” he said. “We did miss out on the big story in the last 20 years and by ignoring it, we risk losing out on the next wave as well.” Canada calls itself a “trading nation,” but that has historically meant sending stuff to the United States, the destination of about 70 per cent of Canadian exports. Companies and diplomats that do work up the courage to look beyond North America tend to first look at Asia, which has emerged as the main engine of the global economy. A pedestrian waits by an oil tanker waiting in a queue of traffic outside the Port of Luanda in Luanda, Angola. Photo by Simon Dawson/Bloomberg files A recent report by Export Development Canada (EDC) analyzed historic trade data to determine future growth opportunities around the world. Current trade volumes didn’t leave the authors with much reason to encourage exporters to consider Africa. EDC grouped Africa with the Middle East and predicted the region’s share of Canadian exports would remain flat in the years ahead. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report also predicted that the share of exports destined to Asia and Oceania would climb to 17 per cent of the total in 2030, from 12 per cent in 2019. Asia became a central focus for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government as it tried to diversify the country’s trade portfolio, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains. The issue, however, is that many other countries, such as the U.S., are also chasing the region after realizing the economic toll of relying on China’s supply chains and manufacturing. “I always say, ‘Think about where people are not going,’” Ciuriak said. Pursuing the Asia-Pacific is worthwhile, but Australia, which tends to sell the same goods and services as Canada, will likely have better luck because of its proximity to the region’s fast-growing economies. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We’re going to some place where everyone’s lined up,” Ciuriak said. “Take a number.” In 2019, two per cent of Canada’s merchandise exports went to Africa and the Middle East and the EDC report predicts that will grow to a measly 2.1 per cent in nine years. That’s nothing to get excited about. But Ciuriak said the report doesn’t account for upcoming structural changes to African economies, which boosts the potential for Canadian businesses. The AfCFTA would integrate 1.3 billion people across the continent, making trade easier to conduct. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa will grow 86 per cent to 212 million people by 2030, creating a bigger cohort of consumers, according to a report by Ciuriak. The population of working-age residents is set to balloon from 700 million to one billion by the same year, expanding the labour market. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Meena Aier, a senior research economist at EDC and author of its report, acknowledged that her models don’t account for such structural changes because to do so would require speculating. The aim of the study was to provide a “more stable scenario” of what could happen if exporters continued to behave as they have in the past. “The opportunities are there, but have we made full use of it?,” Aier said. “The data says we have not.” Clouds gather but produce no rain as cracks are seen in the dried up municipal dam in drought-stricken Graaff-Reinet, South Africa.

The region is prone to political conflict, many countries are vulnerable to pressures created by climate pressures, and poverty remains extreme.

Article content Yet Drone Delivery looked past the negative headlines, recognizing the opportunity that lay there. “The African market is not homogenous,” Zahra said. “Every country is very different from culture, language and from an economic and political point of view.” But by partnering with Astral Aviation to get local expertise, he’s expecting to find a variety of customers that will use his drones. A server works inside a cafe in Nairobi, Kenya. Photo by Monicah Mwangi/Reuters “(Kenya) has the potential to significantly accelerate the operations and the success of the business,” he said. The continent “is just a massive, massive market.” The absence of a clear Africa strategy over the past two decades might have kept some businesses from taking a chance on Africa. Emerging from the 2008 financial crisis, former prime minister Stephen Harper shifted his strategic trade plan away from Africa, closing trade commissions to free up resources for a push into Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China, said Omar Allam, former deputy director for Africa at the federal trade department. Harper and officials also made very few trips to the continent, which created distance between Canada and African countries. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content On the flip side, Trudeau and his officials visited more often, but they didn’t have a concrete trade strategy such as Harper’s Global Markets Action Plan, Allam said. “It’s very much an ad hoc approach,” Allam, who now heads his own international trade consultancy, said of both governments’ dealings with Africa. “Canada has a lot to offer African economies … but we need a clear strategy and the right boots on the ground.” Canada has a lot to offer African economies … but we need a clear strategy and the right boots on the ground Omar Allam If a Conservative or Liberal government makes good on its election promise to pick up the pace in Africa, it will find itself in China’s shadow. The country has a huge head start and has made a point of investing in Africa in order to secure the natural resources it needs to power its massive growth. In 2019, China spent US$44.3 billion in foreign direct investment stock in Africa, according to Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, while Canada spent $10.7 billion.

Colarocchio heads InControl Systems Inc., a 35-year old company based in Markham, Ont., that manufactures, integrates and supplies commercial fire protection systems. His dealings are primarily in the oil and gas and power-generation sectors, but he also sells gear to fertilizer, pharmaceutical and steel plants. About 80 per cent of InControl Systems’ revenues come from exports, with most of the demand coming from the Middle East due to a steady stream of oil projects. It has completed projects and supplied systems primarily in North African countries, but has incurred difficulty in sub-Saharan countries. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Part of the issue with demand from the continent is a lack of robust fire safety protocols that aren’t standardized across jurisdictions or borders. On top of that, Colarocchio said he can’t compete with other foreign firms whose governments have heavily invested in the region. “If the Canadian government was making more investments there, then it would be easier for us to be involved in the projects to supply fire systems,” he said. Even though InControl Systems subscribes to national databases that notify businesses of upcoming projects, such as a power plant or refinery, it’s not uncommon in his experience for the Gabonese government, for example, to award the contract to a Chinese firm.

Indeed, Zahra hopes to get his first drone off Kenyan ground sometime next year. “The downfall in not addressing (Africa) is that you miss out on being in markets that are booming, that are growing,” he said.

Salary is no longer employees’ top priority when it comes to deciding whether to remain in their current role or accept a new job, an ADP Canada survey found. Asked what Canadians looked for in a new role, 32 per cent of working Canadians said an organization that respects their work-life balance is most important, followed by 25 per cent looking for a better salary. The payroll company found that the 15 per cent of employed Canadians — and 22 per cent of remote workers — who voluntarily transitioned to a new position or industry or left the workforce did so due to personal life changes (33 per cent), the need to reduce their workload and stress (29 per cent) or out of a desire for more flexible hours (28 per cent).

Share this Story: Trailer parks could hold the answer to Canada's national housing crisis Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Breadcrumb Trail Links Real Estate Trailer parks could hold the answer to Canada's national housing crisis Coveted as winning investments, MHCs also offer buyers affordable homes that range in price from $120,000 to $350,000 Author of the article: Joe O'Connor Publishing date: Sep 10, 2021 • 2 days ago • 9 minute read • 92 Comments There is a potential throwback answer to the nation’s affordable housing woes: the humble trailer park. Photo by Mike Hensen/The London Free Press files Article content Taylor Thiessen was in her late 20s, owned a nail salon and a dog named Pepper, and had a plan, as 2019 edged to a close, to buy a condominium in downtown Salmon Arm, B.C. It was going to be her first home, and it was going to be perfect, until she did the math and found the numbers did not fit within her budget. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A friend mentioned a place for sale in Countryside Mobile Manor. That is, a trailer park — referred to in the more refined lingo of the 21st century as a manufactured home community (MHC) — about seven minutes from downtown Salmon Arm. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Trailer parks could hold the answer to Canada's national housing crisis Back to video Thiessen never pictured herself living in a trailer park. But she had an open mind, which is how the now 29-year-old became the proud owner of a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom, open-concept place backing onto a golf course and bordered by mature pine trees. Her neighbours, all a good deal older than her, turned out to be “lovely.” For $160,000, plus $460 a month for the pad rental, the trailer’s price was about half of what the new condo (plus fees) would have been. “Moving into Countryside was the best decision I could have possibly made,” Thiessen said. “I wound up being so happy there.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Happiness and a blistering hot national housing market, for those looking to crack into it, are not often complementary terms. The average price of a Canadian home has rocketed past $700,000, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, beyond the scope of many people looking for a first home. This cost-of-living crisis has politicians of every stripe throwing around affordable housing-themed pledges during the election campaign: build a million new homes (Conservatives); build 500,000 new homes (NDP); ban foreign ownership, hamstring would-be house-flippers and “build, preserve, or repair” 1.4 million homes (Liberals). Apparently overlooked, amid all the promises and political talk, is a potential throwback answer to the nation’s affordable housing woes: the humble trailer park.

Article content “We have a housing crisis with a historical solution sitting right in front of us, it is absolutely staring us in the face,” said Mark Kenney, chief executive of Canadian Apartment Real Estate Investment Trust (CAPREIT), a Toronto-based company that owns more than $16 billion in assets, including 77 manufactured home communities.

Thompson/National Post Painted in popular culture as the domain of petty criminals, drunks, dope fiends and welfare bums — with some help from Trailer Park Boys, the Canadian cult-television hit — MHCs are coveted as winning investments by pension funds, real estate investment trusts and private-equity players, as well as the traditional and still very active mom-and-pop-style family owners. As for those trailers, well, they aren’t actually trailers anymore. Instead of axles and wheels, buyers get factory-built-to-code, energy-efficient homes set on concrete blocks, and they range in size from about 500 to 1,800 square feet, and in price from $120,000 to $350,000 (or even more) for ultra-deluxe models. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Owners also get a yard to garden in, a driveway to park the car in and, at Countryside Mobile Manor, a golf course next door. “People have a complete misconception of what these are,” Kenney said. “People will say, ‘Oh, but,’ and I say, you have a yard, you probably have amenities you don’t have in a subdivision — and you are into the investment market.” We have a housing crisis with a historical solution sitting right in front of us, it is absolutely staring us in the face Mark Kenney, chief executive, Canadian Apartment Real Estate Investment Trust You also don’t have neighbours above, below or sharing the walls beside you. In sum, buy in a manufactured home community and you get an asset, while CAPREIT and other multi-billion-dollar giants, such as Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc. and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, get a new tenant and charge them rent for the land. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Brookfield owns 136 communities across the United States, valued at more than US$2 billion, and, according to a 2020 company report, it intends “to grow this business through additional” acquisitions. The overall value of transactions involving manufactured home communities in the U.S. was US$4.2 billion in 2020, up from US$3.2 billion in 2019, according to JLL Capital Markets, a Chicago-based real estate services firm. MHCs are big business indeed, but they are also places where people live, and champions of the model argue that these types of communities could ameliorate Canada’s affordable housing crisis, if only the public, politicians and media could get past the negative stereotyping, and legislators could hack away at a tangle of red tape and smile favourably upon new MHCs in zoning legislation. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “The reality is, you’re not getting into a tree fort for less than $400,000 anywhere near Vancouver as a young person,” said Darren Hoblak, the former owner, along with his two siblings, of Countryside Mobile Manor. You have a yard, you probably have amenities you don’t have in a subdivision — and you are into the investment market Mark Kenney The family recently sold the business to another mom-and-pop MHC operator for about $10 million. Hoblak’s father, John, was an independent Abbotsford, B.C., grocer, who got hooked on the idea of trailer parks in the early 1970s, the golden age of park construction in Canada. The younger Hoblak remembers clearing brush as a kid on a 25-acre parcel of land in what is now downtown Abbotsford. That first park was called Allwood Estates. The family liked the business so much that they expanded their holdings, and eventually exited the grocery industry altogether. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “The parks are a good return on investment,” Hoblak said. “It is good money, year to year.” Countryside, for example, had 136 tenants paying an average monthly rent of about $460. There is very little tenant turnover, an industry norm — six or seven per cent versus 30 per cent in apartment buildings — and since residents actually own their homes, there is both pride of ownership and motivation to make rent, since bouncing cheques means putting one’s saleable asset at risk. Manufactured homes are energy efficient and affordable and come with yards and parking spaces. Photo by Kerry Tarnow Factor in the new age of remote work, people leaving ridiculously expensive big cities to be closer to nature and further away from COVID-19 epicentres and closed-until-further-notice offices, and the idea of a young person or family moving into a trailer park doesn’t sound so wacky after all. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content At least, not after the hypothetical first-time homebuyer crunches the numbers, as Taylor Thiessen did. “Owning a manufactured home is a very achievable set-up for a young person starting out,” Hoblak said. The man he refers to as “the guru” — actual name, Al Kemp — agrees. Kemp is executive director of the Manufactured Home Park Owners Alliance of British Columbia, a not-for-profit representing about half of the province’s park owners. B.C. is home to almost 1,000 MHCs, consisting of about 60,000 households. Coast to coast, there are more than 190,000 households living in a manufactured home, and the majority of owners are 55 and over. Kemp, a gentleman of a certain age, who requests that his age not be published, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the field and an intense dislike of the Trailer Park Boys franchise. Or, the “trailer trash boys,” in his words. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “They are the worst thing that could have possibly happened to our industry in the past 20 years,” he said. Kemp met with David Eby, B.C.’s Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing earlier this year to discuss MHCs, of which, he said, the politician knew almost “nothing about.” He hopes to meet with Eby again later this fall. A scene from a mobile home community in Ontario. Photo by Mike Hensen/The London Free Press/QMI Agency files Meantime, the guru’s pitch on affordable housing is to try to convince the province to unlock some of its almost 90-million hectares of Crown land to develop new manufactured home communities. “I am not looking for money from the government,” Kemp said. “The developers are out there, and the demand is out there, if land were made available.” Kenney, at CAPREIT, is also a bit of an MHC evangelist, despite such communities comprising less than five per cent of his company’s real estate holdings. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We’ve got lots of land in Canada, that’s not the problem,” he said. “There has been a severe lack of development in this area for about 30 years.” This isn’t just big shots in corner offices bellyaching while looking to pave over paradise. There is an actual historical precedent here, where the humble trailer, complete with wheels and axles, solved a housing crisis. A mobile home community in Louisiana, U.S. Photo by Sheldon Alberts/Postmedia News files Trailers were used to house recruits that flooded military bases in the United States during the Second World War. After the war, a good portion of veterans headed off to college — and campus housing – in trailers. The source of 21st-century scorn was, in the days of yore, the mark of an educated, affluent and upwardly mobile America. Today, more than 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, a national trade organization headquartered in Arlington, Va. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Of course, it is not all ponies, roses and rainbows south of the border. Horror stories abound of faceless, soulless, predatory MHC owners jacking up rental fees in the parks, whose typical 2021 resident tends to be the pensioner on a fixed income or families with few pennies to spare. In an effort to protect them, Iowa representative Cindy Axne recently introduced a Manufactured Housing Tenants’ Bill of Rights to Congress. “All tenants, regardless of where they live, should have the basic rights as residents that will protect them from unacceptable and predatory practices …” she said in a statement. Back in Canada, most jurisdictions offer some form of rent protection for MHC residents. Alas, being arguably kinder and gentler as a nation hasn’t made it any easier for working folk and retirees to afford a roof over one’s head. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Part of the trouble is that there simply aren’t enough roofs. Nasty things happen to home prices when demand outstrips supply, money is cheap to borrow, and people are stuck on the notion of homeownership as emblematic of the Canadian Dream. “You have to increase supply,” said Remco Daal, president of Canadian real estate at QuadReal Property Group Ltd. Partnership, which is wholly owned by the British Columbia Investment Management Corp., a.k.a. the B.C. public-sector pension fund with almost 700,000 members.

Collingwood, Ont.-based Parkbridge is among the largest MHC owners in Canada, with more than 60 properties. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The pension fund also knows a thing or two about owning apartments, as well as trying to get new ones built. Daal paints a tortuous portrait of what it would take, say, to get a new, entirely fictional apartment building built in Vancouver. It’s an example best summarized for the imagined would-be tenants as: take a number and be prepared to wait eight years before you actually get the key. “It is not for lack of capital, it is not for lack of space, it is not for lack of willingness, it has just become really hard,” he said. Getting a trailer park built is somewhat easier, he added, but only by degrees. MHCs aren’t apartment buildings and they are not going to solve the housing crunch in Canada’s major cities. But if they can take some of the pressure off elsewhere, where land is cheaper, and the mountains, lakes, golf courses and home offices with high-speed Internet beckon, why not?

Tiff Macklem charts Bank of Canada's path out of pandemic stimulus Back to video The Bank of Canada deployed QE to fight the COVID-19 recession, and has so far acquired more than $330 billion of Government of Canada debt since the end of March 2020. Central bankers dislike becoming active players in private markets, but without their intervention, the cost of borrowing money to invest probably would drift higher, slowing the recovery. “As the recovery progresses, we are moving closer to a time when continuing to add stimulus through QE will no longer be necessary,” Macklem said in remarks prepared for an event hosted by Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec. “We are not there yet. That timing is a monetary policy decision that will depend on economic developments.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The recession that the pandemic triggered is over, but the recovery remains well short of Macklem’s goals. For example, the labour underutilization rate — an indicator that combines the jobless rate with the number of potential workers who aren’t looking for jobs and employed people who worked less than half their usual number of hours — was 14.4 per cent in July, down from 34.8 per cent in May 2020, but still higher than 11.4 per cent in February 2020. Also, gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of about one per cent in the second quarter, a decline that Macklem described as “more pronounced that we anticipated.” Indeed: forecasters, including the Bank of Canada, had predicted an increase. The Bank of Canada expects “strong” growth over the second half of the year, but policy-makers nonetheless opted to leave the benchmark lending rate pinned near zero at the end of their latest round of policy deliberations on Sept. 8.

Article content They also said they would continue to purchase federal debt at a pace of about $2 billion per week. Bay Street economists and the bond traders they advise are now trying to figure out when policy-makers will taper that amount to zero. Macklem offered no clues about when that will happen, but he did provide a path that should allow market participants plenty of time to figure it out. More On This Topic Bank of Canada sees recovery on track, stays course on policy What's next for the Canadian economy and the loonie after GDP shocker 'A longer road to recovery:' Canada's economy shrinks, catching economists by surprise The end of QE won’t mean the end of the Bank of Canada’s active participation at bond auctions. Macklem said the central bank will pivot to a “reinvestment phase” that will use the proceeds of maturing securities to maintain the Bank of Canada’s portfolio at current levels. The governor said those purchases likely will average about $1 billion per week. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “When we arrive at the reinvestment phase, we will communicate this monetary policy decision clearly,” he said. “When we get to the reinvestment phase and how long we are in it are monetary policy decisions that will depend on the strength of the recovery and the evolution of inflation.” Prices represent the biggest wildcard. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 3.7 per cent in July from a year earlier, matching the biggest gain in a decade. Macklem reiterated that he thinks most of the upward pressure on inflation is the result of temporary factors related to the pandemic, but he conceded that he can’t be sure of that. The central bank’s target for inflation is two per cent, so it can’t tolerate price increases at current levels forever, which is why some Bay Street analysts think policymakers could taper QE as early as next month. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Macklem didn’t close the door on that possibility, emphasizing the reinvestment phase should also be seen as stimulus because it will keep an elevated amount of money in the financial system. He reiterated that he intends to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged until the second half of next year, but made clear that there was no link between the decision about when to raise the interest rate and when to reduce the size of the Bank of Canada’s crisis-era bond holdings. “Eventually, the reinvestment phase will end, and we will stop purchasing bonds to replace the ones that are maturing,” Macklem said. “It is reasonable to expect that when we do eventually need to reduce monetary stimulus, our first move will be to raise the target for the overnight rate — our policy interest rate.” • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Tiff Macklem charts Bank of Canada's path out of pandemic stimulus Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Forget Asia — businesses that dare to venture into Africa are poised to reap the rewards Back to video Vaughan, Ont.-based Drone Delivery builds drones, develops the software that controls them, and supplies hangars where customers can park their remote-controlled aircraft. Since the start of the year, the six-year-old company has brought in revenue of about $250,000, all of it from Canada. Zahra intends to change that. His growth strategy includes international sales and Africa is among the first places where he’s put down a marker, a decision that might hint at a shift in Canada’s thinking about a continent that imports a quarter-trillion-dollars worth of goods.

The tie-up with Astral hasn’t yielded any sales yet, but he’s confident the business will come eventually. “These are massive markets with sophisticated business environments, sophisticated economic environments, huge populations, definite commercial and social needs,” he said in an interview.

Article content International trade has received little attention on the campaign trail, but the policy books suggest that the next government could take an interest in Africa, a part of the world that Ottawa has mostly ignored for the better part of two decades. The Liberal platform states the party would develop a strategy of “economic co-operation” to support the recently ratified African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), increase infrastructure investment and expand partnerships in research and innovation. Conservatives say they would partly reorient Canadian supply chains to Africa and “fully engage” with the 54 members of AfCFTA, “particularly in infrastructure, energy transition, technology, minerals, and food security partnerships.” They also plan to pursue an intelligence-sharing partnership with the African Union and establish “strategic outlooks” with a select few countries.

Between 2001 and 2018, Africa imported US$250-billion worth of goods, but, so far, the European Union and China are reaping the rewards of that expansion, supplying US$140 billion and US$100 billion of those imports, respectively, Ciuriak said.

Article content “Canada went from $1 billion exports (in 2001) to more than $3 billion (in 2018), which is great in terms of percentage growth, but it was peanuts in terms of the share of the overall pie,” he said. “We did miss out on the big story in the last 20 years and by ignoring it, we risk losing out on the next wave as well.” Canada calls itself a “trading nation,” but that has historically meant sending stuff to the United States, the destination of about 70 per cent of Canadian exports. Companies and diplomats that do work up the courage to look beyond North America tend to first look at Asia, which has emerged as the main engine of the global economy. A pedestrian waits by an oil tanker waiting in a queue of traffic outside the Port of Luanda in Luanda, Angola. Photo by Simon Dawson/Bloomberg files A recent report by Export Development Canada (EDC) analyzed historic trade data to determine future growth opportunities around the world. Current trade volumes didn’t leave the authors with much reason to encourage exporters to consider Africa. EDC grouped Africa with the Middle East and predicted the region’s share of Canadian exports would remain flat in the years ahead. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The report also predicted that the share of exports destined to Asia and Oceania would climb to 17 per cent of the total in 2030, from 12 per cent in 2019. Asia became a central focus for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government as it tried to diversify the country’s trade portfolio, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains. The issue, however, is that many other countries, such as the U.S., are also chasing the region after realizing the economic toll of relying on China’s supply chains and manufacturing. “I always say, ‘Think about where people are not going,’” Ciuriak said. Pursuing the Asia-Pacific is worthwhile, but Australia, which tends to sell the same goods and services as Canada, will likely have better luck because of its proximity to the region’s fast-growing economies. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We’re going to some place where everyone’s lined up,” Ciuriak said. “Take a number.” In 2019, two per cent of Canada’s merchandise exports went to Africa and the Middle East and the EDC report predicts that will grow to a measly 2.1 per cent in nine years. That’s nothing to get excited about. But Ciuriak said the report doesn’t account for upcoming structural changes to African economies, which boosts the potential for Canadian businesses. The AfCFTA would integrate 1.3 billion people across the continent, making trade easier to conduct. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa will grow 86 per cent to 212 million people by 2030, creating a bigger cohort of consumers, according to a report by Ciuriak. The population of working-age residents is set to balloon from 700 million to one billion by the same year, expanding the labour market. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Meena Aier, a senior research economist at EDC and author of its report, acknowledged that her models don’t account for such structural changes because to do so would require speculating. The aim of the study was to provide a “more stable scenario” of what could happen if exporters continued to behave as they have in the past. “The opportunities are there, but have we made full use of it?,” Aier said. “The data says we have not.” Clouds gather but produce no rain as cracks are seen in the dried up municipal dam in drought-stricken Graaff-Reinet, South Africa.

The region is prone to political conflict, many countries are vulnerable to pressures created by climate pressures, and poverty remains extreme. The army staged a coup in Guinea at the beginning of September; drought is currently plaguing the southern continent; and less than four per cent of Africans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Article content Yet Drone Delivery looked past the negative headlines, recognizing the opportunity that lay there. “The African market is not homogenous,” Zahra said. “Every country is very different from culture, language and from an economic and political point of view.” But by partnering with Astral Aviation to get local expertise, he’s expecting to find a variety of customers that will use his drones. A server works inside a cafe in Nairobi, Kenya. Photo by Monicah Mwangi/Reuters “(Kenya) has the potential to significantly accelerate the operations and the success of the business,” he said. The continent “is just a massive, massive market.” The absence of a clear Africa strategy over the past two decades might have kept some businesses from taking a chance on Africa. Emerging from the 2008 financial crisis, former prime minister Stephen Harper shifted his strategic trade plan away from Africa, closing trade commissions to free up resources for a push into Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China, said Omar Allam, former deputy director for Africa at the federal trade department. Harper and officials also made very few trips to the continent, which created distance between Canada and African countries. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content On the flip side, Trudeau and his officials visited more often, but they didn’t have a concrete trade strategy such as Harper’s Global Markets Action Plan, Allam said. “It’s very much an ad hoc approach,” Allam, who now heads his own international trade consultancy, said of both governments’ dealings with Africa. “Canada has a lot to offer African economies … but we need a clear strategy and the right boots on the ground.” Canada has a lot to offer African economies … but we need a clear strategy and the right boots on the ground Omar Allam If a Conservative or Liberal government makes good on its election promise to pick up the pace in Africa, it will find itself in China’s shadow. The country has a huge head start and has made a point of investing in Africa in order to secure the natural resources it needs to power its massive growth. In 2019, China spent US$44.3 billion in foreign direct investment stock in Africa, according to Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, while Canada spent $10.7 billion.

Photo by Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images files That investment has paid dividends for Chinese firms, as Canadian business owner Carmine Colarocchio can attest. Colarocchio heads InControl Systems Inc., a 35-year old company based in Markham, Ont., that manufactures, integrates and supplies commercial fire protection systems. His dealings are primarily in the oil and gas and power-generation sectors, but he also sells gear to fertilizer, pharmaceutical and steel plants. About 80 per cent of InControl Systems’ revenues come from exports, with most of the demand coming from the Middle East due to a steady stream of oil projects. It has completed projects and supplied systems primarily in North African countries, but has incurred difficulty in sub-Saharan countries. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Part of the issue with demand from the continent is a lack of robust fire safety protocols that aren’t standardized across jurisdictions or borders. On top of that, Colarocchio said he can’t compete with other foreign firms whose governments have heavily invested in the region. “If the Canadian government was making more investments there, then it would be easier for us to be involved in the projects to supply fire systems,” he said. Even though InControl Systems subscribes to national databases that notify businesses of upcoming projects, such as a power plant or refinery, it’s not uncommon in his experience for the Gabonese government, for example, to award the contract to a Chinese firm.

Indeed, Zahra hopes to get his first drone off Kenyan ground sometime next year. “The downfall in not addressing (Africa) is that you miss out on being in markets that are booming, that are growing,” he said.

The payroll company found that the 15 per cent of employed Canadians — and 22 per cent of remote workers — who voluntarily transitioned to a new position or industry or left the workforce did so due to personal life changes (33 per cent), the need to reduce their workload and stress (29 per cent) or out of a desire for more flexible hours (28 per cent).

Photo by Peter J Thompson/National Post Article content Janrikk Millan was starting to worry. The head chef at Grazie Ristorante was missing about four people in his kitchen in Vaughan, Ont., just north of Toronto. The cooks he had left were complaining about working double shifts through the weekends, lunches and dinners, to keep the restaurant running, clocking as many as 36 hours in three days.

Article content They needed a break, but Millan hadn’t been able to hire anyone in months of searching. After a hectic dinner service in early August, he grabbed a menu on his way out of the restaurant. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

'Something's got to give': Restaurants slash hours, trim menus as worst worker shortage ever cuts deep Back to video “Something’s got to give,” he remembered thinking that night. “This can’t go on.” Millan got home, took the menu out of his pocket and started crossing out dishes. Anything that took too long to prepare had to go, as did anything that took too many cooks, or looked too much like another dish. He scratched out the breaded veal, breaded chicken, spicy shrimp and seafood linguine. Then came the calamari. It was a tough call. The dish is a top seller, and a favourite among the 13-year-old restaurant’s regulars. It also required the squid to be gutted, cleaned, sliced, soaked in buttermilk, breaded in corn flour and fried twice. One cook would be devoted almost entirely to the dish every night. Cut the calamari, and he could give one of his cooks a night off. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The next day, Milan sat down with the restaurant’s owners in the wine room. He pulled out his marked-up menu, with about seven dishes gone, including the calamari. “I just told them, ‘Look, we have to take items out from the menu, because you don’t want guys walking out on you.’ That’s basically it.” The Grazie owners agreed, and the calamari became one of the thousands of cuts and sacrifices that restaurants across Canada are making to stay afloat during an unprecedented labour shortage in the industry. The food service and accommodation sector also has the highest job vacancy rate in the country It couldn’t be a worse time to be short on staff. Restaurants, hobbled by months of lockdowns and seating limitations, are finally able to pull in serious revenue and start the crawl out of debt as those restrictions ease up. Instead, operations from independents to major chains are abandoning lunch services, or shutting down entirely during weekdays because they can’t find enough workers. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Initially, some argued workers weren’t coming back because rosy pandemic benefits had made lower paying service industry jobs unattractive, but the factors behind the shortage now appear to be more complex: Many workers used the time off during the lockdowns to reconsider their careers and move to different, less precarious industries, start their own businesses or go back to school. An aging population, slowed immigration and continued COVID-19 fears are all also suspected of contributing to the shortage. The resulting tight labour market is driving up wages as managers try to hold on to their employees, lure them from competitors or convince them to come back to the business altogether. Lori Misener, of Kingswood’s Restaurant in Brantford, Ont., is having a tough time finding staff as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Photo by Vincent Ball/Postmedia “I’ve talked to some operators, they’ve never seen anything like this,” said Todd Barclay, chief executive of Restaurants Canada, which estimates that at least 10,000 restaurants in Canada have already closed. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The food service and accommodation sector also has the highest job vacancy rate in the country, with 129,000 open positions, according to Statistics Canada data for the month of June, the most recent available. A separate Statistics Canada study on the employment rate in August showed the sector managed to boost jobs over the summer, though they’re still below pre-pandemic levels. But if the numbers don’t keep climbing, many fear the rebound that so many struggling restaurateurs have been hoping for won’t be enough, especially as patio season winds down and high infection rates in some regions start to temper enthusiasm about indoor dining. Recipe Unlimited Corp. — one of Canada’s biggest restaurant chains with brands including The Keg, Swiss Chalet and Harvey’s — is looking to fill 3,500 vacant positions this month. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Managers are constantly dealing with new staff and having to train new staff, so it’s quite exhausting,” Julie Denton, chief people officer at Recipe said in an interview last month. “You’re seeing many restaurants across the country close on Mondays and Tuesdays … They have to give their management teams a break. They cannot work seven days a week. That, for sure, has a ripple effect across the board.” One of the more noticeable effects of the labour shortage, for diners at least, has been lineups outside restaurants that have full sections cordoned off with empty seats. At Le Virunga in Montreal, Zoya de Frias and her mother, the chef Maria-José de Frias, are running the place on their own after their employees either moved or switched industries during the pandemic. To keep up on busy nights, the mother-daughter team limits the number of customers they let in.

To keep up on busy nights, the restaurant has had to limit the number of customers because of a shortage of staff. Photo by Christinne Muschi / National Post “They look at you, they’re kind of puzzled, because you’re fully booked, but you still have space in the restaurant,” she said last month. “It feels like you’re lying to them, but you’re not.” Some diners will offer to be flexible, as long as they can sit and wait at one of the empty tables. “They tell you ‘Oh, it’s OK, we’ll wait … We’ll have some water in the meantime,'” she said. But after they get their water, the reflex is to ask for a cocktail. “It’s a human thing. But you can’t bring them a cocktail, because you have to finish serving the people who are already seated.” Earlier in the summer, Zoya posted a call on Facebook for workers and put a help wanted sign in the window. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “I got eight resumés,” she said. “To be honest with you, some of them had no experience.” Zoya has heard stories from friends in the industry about rounds and rounds of interviews and tryouts only to find a candidate who disappears after two shifts. Le Virunga’s mother-daughter team, working two services, six days a week, barely has time to keep up with the existing service, as well as all the usual bills and paperwork, so there just isn’t time to train someone green. A further complication, Zoya said, is that her restaurant, run by two women specializing in pan-African cuisine, has struggled to attract the same level of applicants as other restaurants. “It’s not an elephant in the room, but it is my reality,” she said. “Even before COVID, I would get less people wanting to come in and work than my friends who are doing mainstream French cuisine.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Zoya said the restaurant industry is a man-led one and “we’re women, and we’re women of colour. When you’re getting directives from a woman, some men have trouble dealing with it.” The plan, since June, has been to hire someone when the business slows down and they have some time to train them. After months of careening between open and closed, it didn’t make sense to slow down the minute diners started coming back. It’s just that they’ve kept coming, week after week, looking at the empty tables and wondering why she can’t seat them. “We’re just trying to, I would say, probably, survive. It’s a sad word, but it’s not. It’s just trying to keep going,” she said. “This is all we can be thinking about and all we’ve been doing.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A survey released in July by U.S. job search site Joblist found that 38 per cent of former hospitality workers are looking elsewhere in search of a different work setting (52 per cent), higher pay (45 per cent), better benefits (29 per cent) and more schedule flexibility (19 per cent). Furthermore, half of them say that nothing would make them return to their old restaurant, bar or hotel jobs. Denton at Recipe Unlimited, said the chain recently conducted a competitive market assessment, comparing its compensation rates to competitors, and opted to improve its benefits packages for salaried and hourly staff, including mental health benefits and personal days. The company is also offering a digital app so employees can change or swap their shifts more easily.

Article content “I think folks are careful about increasing labour rates too much,” Denton said. “In some of the markets that are particularly hot, you’re seeing that.” A few weeks ago, Millan — the head chef at Grazie — got a message from a friend, asking if he wanted a job. They were offering an hourly wage well above most pre-pandemic standards. “They’re short. Now they want to hire you. They want to throw money in your face,” he said. “But how? Like, how can you afford that?” Millan didn’t take the job.

Article content “I’ve been at Grazie restaurant for 11 years,” he said. During the lockdowns, when the restaurant was shut down, Millan and his wife started a side gig, a little pop-up burger stand and the Grazie owners let him use their kitchen to run it. “They’ve been my family,” he said, explaining why he didn’t want to leave them, not for another restaurant, not for anything except his own restaurant, some day. The 31-year-old chef is still hiring. He’s posted on online job boards. He’s calling old staff and digging up old resumés lying around from pre-pandemic times when he had no use for them. But he said all of them have new jobs, some in new industries, or have started their own thing altogether. “I think people are just tired,” Millan said. “There’s no one coming in. No one’s on Indeed. No one’s applying.” • Email: jedmiston@postmedia.com | Twitter: jakeedmiston Share this article in your social network Share this Story: 'Something's got to give': Restaurants slash hours, trim menus as worst worker shortage ever cuts deep Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Housing market at high risk of sharp correction, CMHC says Back to video Though Canada has seen a rising vaccination rate and an improving economy since then, the strength in the housing market is still far beyond what’s warranted by these developments, with prices further detached from labor incomes, the agency said. “We’re seeing price acceleration, over-valuation, and it’s increasing the vulnerabilities for Canada,” Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist, said on a conference call with reporters. “Hopefully we don’t see a large fall in house prices.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content On top of the shift in the national outlook, the agency raised its risk assessment of Montreal’s housing market to high from moderate, bringing the number of Canada’s major cities deemed most at risk to six. Vancouver was a notable exception, seeing its risk assessment fall to low from moderate on an increase of homes on the market that’s caused price growth to settle down. We’re seeing price acceleration, over-valuation, and it’s increasing the vulnerabilities for Canada Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist At the national level, CMHC noted moderate evidence of home price over-valuation, housing supply at critically low levels, and said price appreciation was starting to accelerate. In another sign of how high demand is relative to supply, the agency saw 85 per cent of newly built homes sold upon completion — the highest ratio since the early 2000s.

That’s a 21 per cent increase from a year earlier, with the cost of homes in Toronto and Vancouver now over $1 million. “Housing market activity is very strong, price growth is still very strong, and price levels are still very high, so it’s appropriate to signal the vulnerability,” Dugan said. “Hopefully people can take this information into account before it gets too out of balance, and while it’s still possible to get a more orderly adjustment in these imbalances.” Bloomberg.com Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Housing market at high risk of sharp correction, CMHC says Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team. Postmortem: Why restaurant workers are fleeing the industry Back to video That tension you felt last week was the financial press getting anxious about stagflation, a villain from the 1970s that inspired so much of today’s economic policy.Bloomberg: “The world economy is facing a buildup in stagflationary forces as surging energy prices boost inflation and slow the recovery from the pandemic recession.” Financial Times: “Supply chain disruptions sweeping major economies have reawakened an old nemesis for investors: stagflation.” Globe and Mail: “Rising prices, fragile economy resurrects stagflation as a market threat.” (You’ll need a Globe subscription to go beyond its headline; the Bloomberg and FT stories are available to Financial Post readers.) How serious is the threat that economic growth could crash while prices soar? The economy isn’t roaring like many thought it would earlier this year. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the second quarter, much to the surprise of the Bank of Canada and other forecasters. But the third quarter is looking better. Statistics Canada said on Oct. 1 that preliminary data suggest GDP increased 0.7 per cent in August, compared with a monthly average since 1997 of about 0.2 per cent. The agency also confirmed that the economy shrunk in July, but only by 0.1 per cent, better than the 0.4-per-cent drop that it predicted a month ago. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Canada has entered the difficult phase of the recovery; as Royal Bank of Canada economist Claire Fan said in a note to her clients, the easy fruit has been picked. There are headwinds: drought in Western Canada; sky-high housing prices that appear to be killing demand; extreme supply-chain issues. But Canada’s economy is based on services (see chart). The country’s high vaccination rate should allow services to take over from farmers, builders, and factories as the primary drivers of growth. Slower growth isn’t stagnation. Now, let’s consider inflation. Statistics Canada updated a number of its price gauges last week. (We’ve sampled a few of them in the chart below.) There is most definitely upward pressure on the cost of doing business. Central bankers insist inflation is temporary. The pandemic caused an extreme mismatch between supply and demand that should ease as supply catches up — or when sky-high prices choke demand. Makes sense, although the explanation might require a flexible definition of “temporary.” Analysts at Bank of America said last week that oil prices could climb to US$100 this winter. Uncomfortably high inflation could hang around for more than a few months. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Tiff Macklem’s dashboard The charts the Bank of Canada cares about as it navigates the economy’s exit from the pandemic David Wolf, a former adviser at the Bank of Canada who now is a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said last week that he thinks inflationary pressures will force his former employer to raise interest rates in the first half of 2022. That’s sooner than implied by Governor Tiff Macklem’s official guidance, which states that the Bank of Canada won’t change the interest-rate setting until the second half of next year. The central bank’s models might be producing evidence of a weak economy, but the “facts on the ground” suggest something else, Wolf said at the Bloomberg Canadian Fixed Income Conference. Wolf is in the minority. Millan Mulraine, chief economist at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Fund, told the same conference that Macklem will tolerate faster inflation to complete the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis as soon as possible. The most recent data suggest price pressures have eased somewhat, albeit to hot from white hot. The test could be the extent to which businesses and consumers are willing to tolerate higher prices. Corporate profits and household savings are high. There’s cushion. Will we use it? Wage worries Not all inflation is bad. Job vacancies are at record levels, and that’s driving wages higher. Call it payback. For much of the past decade, economists wondered why labour wasn’t capturing a greater share of GDP amid surging corporate profits. Income gaps could start to narrow. That would be welcome. Still, good inflation can turn bad. Employers could raise the prices of their goods and services to cover higher wage bills, sparking an inflationary spiral. It’s unclear if that’s happening. The Bank of Canada characterized wage growth as “moderate” in July, yet more recent anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise. The data are messy because of everything that was going on a year ago. We’ve been watching a handful of industries that were mostly unaffected by the COVID-19 lockdowns, and comparing recent readings of average weekly earnings with the same month in 2019 to avoid some of the noise created by the pandemic. Statistics Canada added July data on Sept. 28. Managers don’t seem to be getting ahead, but essential and in-demand workers appear to have gained some bargaining power. The shortage of restaurant workers has replaced the price of lumber as everyone’s favourite post-pandemic talking point. Even famous chains such as McDonald’s Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. are struggling to fill jobs. Many industries are struggling with elevated vacancy rates, which measures the proportion of unfilled positions to the total number of occupied and unoccupied jobs (chart below). But the situation is most extreme at hotels, restaurants, and bars. A knee-jerk explanation is that COVID-19 benefits are too generous. Why wash dishes when the government will pay you almost as much to stay at home and do nothing? There’s something to that notion, but probably not as much as the critics who land on that answer think. “After years of investing in an exploitative promise, the dining industry’s best and brightest workers, the cooks and floor staff whose poorly remunerated passion subsidized our luxury dinners, are fleeing the business,” Chris Nuttall-Smith, one of the country’s best food writers, observed in latest edition of Toronto Life magazine. Take a look at the next chart. The restaurant industry is facing the highest vacancy rates in the country. And yet the average offered hourly wage had increased only five per cent in the second quarter from the same period in 2019, according to Statistics Canada data. It was by far the smallest increase among industries with above-average vacancy rates. Why wouldn’t restaurant workers flee? They aren’t being offered a reason to stay. Creative destruction One of former Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz’s favourite indicators was business formation. If an economy is adding companies, it is increasing its capacity to generate wealth without stoking inflation. The recovery from the Great Recession was weaker than Poloz predicted it would be. With hindsight, he realized that the financial crisis had wiped out so many exporters that Canada couldn’t participate in an upsurge in global demand to the degree it had in the past. It’s one of the reasons that he left interest rates so low for so long. More On This Topic Are wages going up?

More encouraging, the pandemic appears to have inspired a more vigorous spirit of entrepreneurship. Canadians created an average of 16,797 new companies between October and June, compared with a monthly average 15,133 in 2019. “I think it’s fertile ground for creativity,” Poloz said in his final interview as governor in the spring of 2020. He might have been right this time. The jump in business creation shouldn’t be taken for granted. There are places where startup and scale-up scenes are thriving, and there are a few places where entrepreneurs are struggling to keep up. The chart below tracks the rate of change in active businesses in select cities since the start of 2015, which is as far back as Statistics Canada’s data goes. The national numbers disguise a stark divide. Cities built on the back of oil and gas are struggling to recapture their former glory, while more diversified local economies appear to be taking full advantage of the shift to digital technology. Policy-makers might take note. • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: CarmichaelKevin _____________________________________________________________ If you like this story sign up for FP Economy Newsletter. _____________________________________________________________ Share this article in your social network Share this Story: Postmortem: Why restaurant workers are fleeing the industry Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Data and interviews with restaurateurs point to a deterioration in finances due to surging costs for everything from salmon to uniforms and labor shortages. A survey found that 51% of small restaurants in the country couldn’t pay their rent in September, up from 40% in July. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Restaurants' Fragile Recovery Is Fizzling in the U.S. Back to video Unlike during most of 2020, today’s struggles aren’t visible with the naked eye: Customers are still flocking to eateries, for the most part, in spite of rising prices and lingering fears of the delta coronavirus variant. But the anxiety over mounting expenses is palpable among restaurant owners from New York City to Nashville, Tennessee. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “You might see a restaurant that’s doing well on a Friday night, but that doesn’t at all tell the story of how they’re doing. Probably not good,” said Daisuke Utagawa, a Washington, D.C., chef whose restaurants include Haikan and Daikaya. “For us, personally, we haven’t seen any sort of recovery. We are still underwater.” The industry is raising the alarm. Its main lobbying group this week called on Congress for more aid to help meet payroll and pay down debt, citing a survey showing that a majority of restaurant operators have seen business conditions deteriorate in the past three months. Like many companies around the world, food-service firms are also hit by supply-chain bottlenecks. Underscoring the surge in expenses, a closely watched price gauge hit its highest since 1991 in August, driven by energy and food, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Article content “Our kitchen labor costs are up 20%, maybe more,” said Jeff Katz, partner at Crown Shy and Saga in New York City. “The question is, how much more can the customer handle. We haven’t raised our prices yet, but these costs are real.” The rebound has been shaky and uneven across the country, even for national chains. Darden Restaurants Inc., which has about 870 Olive Garden locations, said last week that sales bounced back slightly in September after falling off in August. Georgia and Florida have seen pressure from the delta variant in recent weeks, Chief Executive Officer Gene Lee said on a conference call. But California locations are getting better. Large public-traded companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and McDonald’s Corp. are scheduled to report quarterly earnings in October. While the recovery in fast food has been stronger, with brisk sales via drive-thru and takeout options, costs and the lack of workers are eating into profitability.

Article content “The biggest headwind is pure availability of labor,” said Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman. “That’s all weighing on margins.” Heading into the winter with Covid-19 still spreading in parts of the U.S., some customers may be more wary to patronize indoor venues. But one of the biggest concerns on restaurateurs’ minds today is the dearth of cooks and waiters, many of whom are unwilling to come back to the industry in spite of higher wages. “It’s a constant increase and you still can’t find people,” said Danny Abrams, owner of Mermaid Inn restaurants in Manhattan. “I had an Italian restaurant, Sirenetta, on the Upper West Side. I can’t reopen because I can’t find an Italian chef, I can’t find staff.” Sit-down eateries are particularly hard hit, with employment still 500,000 jobs below prepandemic levels. Fewer staff and high turnover has hurt customer service, with clients complaining about inexperienced staff and wait times.

Article content Many restaurateurs have raised menu prices, and consumers are starting to notice. Almost two-thirds of customers say they’re either ordering less or visiting restaurants less often due to price increases, according to an August survey by Bluedot, a location-based software company. Still, nationwide sales have remained brisk since the economy reopened and Americans, many of them vaccinated and flush with savings racked up during long months of isolation, flocked back to eateries and pubs. Spending at quick- and full-service restaurants is up 7% compared with 2019, according to data from dining-loyalty program Rewards Network. The number of customers is down, however, meaning part of the gain in dollars is due to higher menu prices.

Article content NoHo Hospitality co-founder Andrew Carmellini is seeing high demand at his restaurants in New York City, Baltimore, Detroit and Nashville. At Carne Mare in Manhattan, he has raised steak prices by 15%. “Everything is costing more, especially in the luxury food category, but customers are paying the price,” Carmellini said. For how long remains the question. At a casual seafood place such as Abrams’s Mermaid Inn, the unofficial ceiling for entrees is $30. Beyond that, the place loses customers, he said. And yet the price of salmon has doubled, killing margins. “It’s going to be touch and go for us, we’re planning for another fall and winter of uncertainty,” Abrams said. ” We are by no means out of the woods.” ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Photo by Peter J Thompson/National Post Article content Janrikk Millan was starting to worry. The head chef at Grazie Ristorante was missing about four people in his kitchen in Vaughan, Ont., just north of Toronto. The cooks he had left were complaining about working double shifts through the weekends, lunches and dinners, to keep the restaurant running, clocking as many as 36 hours in three days.

'Something's got to give': Restaurants slash hours, trim menus as worst worker shortage ever cuts deep Back to video “Something’s got to give,” he remembered thinking that night. “This can’t go on.” Millan got home, took the menu out of his pocket and started crossing out dishes. Anything that took too long to prepare had to go, as did anything that took too many cooks, or looked too much like another dish. He scratched out the breaded veal, breaded chicken, spicy shrimp and seafood linguine. Then came the calamari. It was a tough call. The dish is a top seller, and a favourite among the 13-year-old restaurant’s regulars. It also required the squid to be gutted, cleaned, sliced, soaked in buttermilk, breaded in corn flour and fried twice. One cook would be devoted almost entirely to the dish every night. Cut the calamari, and he could give one of his cooks a night off. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The next day, Milan sat down with the restaurant’s owners in the wine room. He pulled out his marked-up menu, with about seven dishes gone, including the calamari. “I just told them, ‘Look, we have to take items out from the menu, because you don’t want guys walking out on you.’ That’s basically it.” The Grazie owners agreed, and the calamari became one of the thousands of cuts and sacrifices that restaurants across Canada are making to stay afloat during an unprecedented labour shortage in the industry. The food service and accommodation sector also has the highest job vacancy rate in the country It couldn’t be a worse time to be short on staff. Restaurants, hobbled by months of lockdowns and seating limitations, are finally able to pull in serious revenue and start the crawl out of debt as those restrictions ease up. Instead, operations from independents to major chains are abandoning lunch services, or shutting down entirely during weekdays because they can’t find enough workers. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Initially, some argued workers weren’t coming back because rosy pandemic benefits had made lower paying service industry jobs unattractive, but the factors behind the shortage now appear to be more complex: Many workers used the time off during the lockdowns to reconsider their careers and move to different, less precarious industries, start their own businesses or go back to school. An aging population, slowed immigration and continued COVID-19 fears are all also suspected of contributing to the shortage. The resulting tight labour market is driving up wages as managers try to hold on to their employees, lure them from competitors or convince them to come back to the business altogether. Lori Misener, of Kingswood’s Restaurant in Brantford, Ont., is having a tough time finding staff as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Photo by Vincent Ball/Postmedia “I’ve talked to some operators, they’ve never seen anything like this,” said Todd Barclay, chief executive of Restaurants Canada, which estimates that at least 10,000 restaurants in Canada have already closed. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The food service and accommodation sector also has the highest job vacancy rate in the country, with 129,000 open positions, according to Statistics Canada data for the month of June, the most recent available. A separate Statistics Canada study on the employment rate in August showed the sector managed to boost jobs over the summer, though they’re still below pre-pandemic levels. But if the numbers don’t keep climbing, many fear the rebound that so many struggling restaurateurs have been hoping for won’t be enough, especially as patio season winds down and high infection rates in some regions start to temper enthusiasm about indoor dining. Recipe Unlimited Corp. — one of Canada’s biggest restaurant chains with brands including The Keg, Swiss Chalet and Harvey’s — is looking to fill 3,500 vacant positions this month. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Managers are constantly dealing with new staff and having to train new staff, so it’s quite exhausting,” Julie Denton, chief people officer at Recipe said in an interview last month. “You’re seeing many restaurants across the country close on Mondays and Tuesdays … They have to give their management teams a break. They cannot work seven days a week. That, for sure, has a ripple effect across the board.” One of the more noticeable effects of the labour shortage, for diners at least, has been lineups outside restaurants that have full sections cordoned off with empty seats. At Le Virunga in Montreal, Zoya de Frias and her mother, the chef Maria-José de Frias, are running the place on their own after their employees either moved or switched industries during the pandemic. To keep up on busy nights, the mother-daughter team limits the number of customers they let in.

Zoya de Frias cleans glassware in preparation of opening for dinner inside their restaurant Le Virunga in Montreal. To keep up on busy nights, the restaurant has had to limit the number of customers because of a shortage of staff. Photo by Christinne Muschi / National Post “They look at you, they’re kind of puzzled, because you’re fully booked, but you still have space in the restaurant,” she said last month. “It feels like you’re lying to them, but you’re not.” Some diners will offer to be flexible, as long as they can sit and wait at one of the empty tables. “They tell you ‘Oh, it’s OK, we’ll wait … We’ll have some water in the meantime,'” she said. But after they get their water, the reflex is to ask for a cocktail. “It’s a human thing. But you can’t bring them a cocktail, because you have to finish serving the people who are already seated.” Earlier in the summer, Zoya posted a call on Facebook for workers and put a help wanted sign in the window. Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “I got eight resumés,” she said. “To be honest with you, some of them had no experience.” Zoya has heard stories from friends in the industry about rounds and rounds of interviews and tryouts only to find a candidate who disappears after two shifts. Le Virunga’s mother-daughter team, working two services, six days a week, barely has time to keep up with the existing service, as well as all the usual bills and paperwork, so there just isn’t time to train someone green. A further complication, Zoya said, is that her restaurant, run by two women specializing in pan-African cuisine, has struggled to attract the same level of applicants as other restaurants. “It’s not an elephant in the room, but it is my reality,” she said. “Even before COVID, I would get less people wanting to come in and work than my friends who are doing mainstream French cuisine.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Zoya said the restaurant industry is a man-led one and “we’re women, and we’re women of colour. When you’re getting directives from a woman, some men have trouble dealing with it.” The plan, since June, has been to hire someone when the business slows down and they have some time to train them. After months of careening between open and closed, it didn’t make sense to slow down the minute diners started coming back. It’s just that they’ve kept coming, week after week, looking at the empty tables and wondering why she can’t seat them. “We’re just trying to, I would say, probably, survive. It’s a sad word, but it’s not. It’s just trying to keep going,” she said. “This is all we can be thinking about and all we’ve been doing.” Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A survey released in July by U.S. job search site Joblist found that 38 per cent of former hospitality workers are looking elsewhere in search of a different work setting (52 per cent), higher pay (45 per cent), better benefits (29 per cent) and more schedule flexibility (19 per cent). Furthermore, half of them say that nothing would make them return to their old restaurant, bar or hotel jobs. Denton at Recipe Unlimited, said the chain recently conducted a competitive market assessment, comparing its compensation rates to competitors, and opted to improve its benefits packages for salaried and hourly staff, including mental health benefits and personal days. The company is also offering a digital app so employees can change or swap their shifts more easily.

Article content “I think folks are careful about increasing labour rates too much,” Denton said. “In some of the markets that are particularly hot, you’re seeing that.” A few weeks ago, Millan — the head chef at Grazie — got a message from a friend, asking if he wanted a job. They were offering an hourly wage well above most pre-pandemic standards. “They’re short. Now they want to hire you. They want to throw money in your face,” he said. “But how? Like, how can you afford that?” Millan didn’t take the job.

Article content “I’ve been at Grazie restaurant for 11 years,” he said. During the lockdowns, when the restaurant was shut down, Millan and his wife started a side gig, a little pop-up burger stand and the Grazie owners let him use their kitchen to run it. “They’ve been my family,” he said, explaining why he didn’t want to leave them, not for another restaurant, not for anything except his own restaurant, some day. The 31-year-old chef is still hiring. He’s posted on online job boards. He’s calling old staff and digging up old resumés lying around from pre-pandemic times when he had no use for them. But he said all of them have new jobs, some in new industries, or have started their own thing altogether. “I think people are just tired,” Millan said. “There’s no one coming in. No one’s on Indeed. No one’s applying.” • Email: jedmiston@postmedia.com | Twitter: jakeedmiston Share this article in your social network Share this Story: 'Something's got to give': Restaurants slash hours, trim menus as worst worker shortage ever cuts deep Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.
