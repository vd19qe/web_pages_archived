This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law.

Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30.

Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Residents will continue to see City crews and contractors working on behalf of the City, out doing essential infrastructure and maintenance work ranging from road work to sewer infrastructure repairs. The City of St. Catharines provides several essential services such as the delivery of drinking water and the related maintenance that entails. With this work physical distancing between workers is not always feasible. In light of this the City is taking a number of precautions and using a multi-layered approach to protect the health of its workers, and community as a whole, such as: Self assessments of workers; Self isolation when warranted by self assessment; Physical distancing of at least two metres when feasible; Limiting physical interactions such as hand shaking, when physical distancing is not feasible; Use of personal protective equipment; Proper hygiene practices such as frequent hand washing; and Increased cleaning and disinfection of work environments St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts.

Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario.

Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced While these areas remain open to pass through all amenities and structures are closed; benches, playground equipment, pavilions, leash-free dog parks, fitness equipment and picnic tables all remain off limits In general, if you are not moving along you should not be in these areas Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Fields and green spaces are not to be used for any form of sports, this includes a single person kicking a ball around or two individuals tossing a frisbee The Victoria Lawn Cemetery is not open for walk through traffic at this time, the cemetery is only open for funeral services and burials Parking lots at trails and parks remain closed to deter groups from congregating, consider using a green space for walkthrough use within walking distance of your home While the City has opted to keep its trails and parks open, for walkthrough use only, other areas not operated by the municipality, such as Provincial Parks, are, or may be, closed Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage City beaches can be used for the same walkthrough use Landscaping and Maintenance Recognizing the importance of property maintenance, and in response to questions from the community, the City of St. Catharines is providing some clarity about lawn maintenance, landscaping, and construction. Landscaping, property maintenance and lawn care businesses that are providing services strictly for safety, security or sanitation purposes will be permitted. Permitted services and work include: Lawn cutting and spraying to prevent weeds, ticks and mosquitoes alongside adherance to property standards Construction of landscape steps, granular sidewalks and driveways for buildings being constructed under previously issued residential building permits Fence repairs, only if to manage and maintain security or safety of a property Residents conducting select property maintenance on their own property in adherance with municipal and provincial regulations As per the provincial regulations, some activities are not permitted until further notice. Such businesses are prohibited from landscaping projects aimed at beautifying or aesthetically improving a property and certain construction efforts. Prohibitted landscaping / construction business activities and projects include: Planting of trees and shrubs Construction of pools, sheds, detached garages, carports and decks Installation of new asphalt, interlocking brick, or concrete driveways Businesses with questions about the Provincial list of essential businesses and services can continue to call the Province’s ‘Stop the Spread’ Business Information Line at 1-888-444-3659. Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publically available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, benches, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. . Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five, themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to helpget a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice. Closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie All recreation centres including Russell Avenue and Port Weller All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm Beaches: open for walk-through use only Parks: restricted use All branches of the St. Catharines Public Library The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel Garden City Golf Course Victoria Lawn Cemetery, open for cemetery business and visitors only While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. . Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five, themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community.

State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. . Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five, themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. . Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five, themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow. Travel and COVID-19 If you have traveled outside of Canada and returned on March 13 or after, you are required to self isolate for a 14-day period. See the the information above, and additional resources below for more information on self isolation. Call ahead to allow health care staff to take appropriate precautions.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice. Closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie All recreation centres including Russell Avenue and Port Weller All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm Beaches: open for walk-through use only Parks: restricted use All branches of the St. Catharines Public Library The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel Garden City Golf Course Victoria Lawn Cemetery, open for cemetery business and visitors only While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. . Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five, themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to July 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19?

Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five (ten people starting June 12). At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Please note: With businesses reopening downtown and more individuals returning to work paid parking will resume for all designated on-street parking spaces, off-street lots and garages on July 1. This will encourage turnover in parking spaces ensuring availability for those heading downtown to shop and work. Payment is not required, on a temporary basis, for on-street or in municipal parking lots. This is to take away numerous people touching the same parking machines throughout the day. Parking enforcement for lack of payment will also be suspended until further notice. Parking enforcement is currently limited to safety-related issues such as fire-routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants. Time-limit restrictions have been relaxed to help those working from home or self- isolating. If you have a driveway the City encourages you to use it, keeping in mind there could be increased stationary vehicles on the road. We are all in this together - let’s be considerate of our neighbours. All residential permits that expire while we are closed to the public will still be honoured. Any new permits or renewals can be purchased once City Hall reopens. Residents who would like to dispute a ticket, can do so by scheduling a telephone screening. Phone interviews will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 11:50 a.m. until further notice. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. 1 Limiting parking enforcement to safety-related issues (including but not limited to fire routes, accessible parking, no-parking areas and fire hydrants) until June 30. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five (ten people starting June 12). At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Transit St. Catharines Transit has announced a modified service schedule to ensure service reliability and safety of employees and passengers. Additional details and a full schedule can be found on the St. Catharines Transit Commission website and on the Transit app. Transit is to be used only for essential trips such as to the grocery store, pharmacy and work. Parking Please note: With businesses reopening downtown and more individuals returning to work paid parking will resume for all designated on-street parking spaces, off-street lots and garages on July 1. This will encourage turnover in parking spaces ensuring availability for those heading downtown to shop and work. Residential parking permits can now be processed by Citizens First.

Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. The City has introduced a payment grace period to support residents and businesses. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums remain closed. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum.

If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

By-law comes into effect on July 17, 2020. COVID-19 spreads readily in indoor spaces, especially where physical separation of two metres between individuals is not possible or difficult. With recovery efforts underway more people are sharing indoor spaces. With growing evidence that masks operate as a barrier preventing those with COVID-19, including asymptomatic individuals, from spreading it to others, ensuring mask use is widely adopted will help to slow the spread of the virus while ensuring re-opening efforts continue. Please continue reading, or check out our Mandatory Masks By-Law FAQ for more information. Definition of a mask Under the by-law any cloth (non-medical) mask, medical mask or other face covering such as a bandana or scarf may be used, provided it securely covers the nose, mouth and chin without gaps.

Additionally, business owners will be required to post clear and prominent signage at entry points that visitors and employees are required to wear a mask in accordance with the by-law. The policy must be available for inspection by enforcement officers by request, and should outline not only the mask requirement but also the exemptions mentioned above. The policy must also require employees within areas accessible by the public to also wear masks and all employees must be trained in the requirements of the policy. Businesses are also expected to have hand sanitizer at entrances / exits to the premises. The policy must also outline exemptions for temporary removal of masks.

Transit is asking its riders, and those visiting its facilities, to wear a mask or face covering. Proper Mask Use Niagara Region Public Health provides the following guidance for effective and safe use of face coverings: Clean your hands before putting a mask on and taking it off. Clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds. Make sure the mask fits. No gaps between the face covering and your face. It should cover your mouth and nose from below the eyes to around the chin.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures All City facilities have closed to the public until further notice.

COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Parks and Trails The City is following the provincial directive and easing some restrictions on outdoor spaces. Parks and trails can now be used for passive purposes such as a picnic or playing catch with a member of your household. Organized sports remain prohibited, as do any gatherings of groups over five (ten people starting June 12). At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, the Lakeside Park Carousel, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. This, however, is subject to change. Please note: Always maintain a safe physical distance of two metres (six feet) from others, if you can’t do this in a space consider walking in a different area Congregating in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people is in violation of Provincial Emergency Orders and will be enforced Be courteous, don’t litter and keep our trails and parks clean Be respectful of others Individuals can walk their dogs on trails and in parks but dogs must be kept on a leash at all times and pet owners must clean up after their pets Always follow directions from police and City by-law officials Do not remove barricades or signage Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law.

During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts.

Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Russell Avenue Community Centre All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm All branches of the St. Catharines Public Library The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items.

A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well.

The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice.

Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre During the ongoing state of emergency and related closures the St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is offering up an array of virtual, and educational fun, including school lesson plans, virtual tours, games, blogs and podcasts. All are free. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

By-law comes into effect on July 17, 2020. COVID-19 spreads readily in indoor spaces, especially where physical separation of two metres between individuals is not possible or difficult. With recovery efforts underway more people are sharing indoor spaces. With growing evidence that masks operate as a barrier preventing those with COVID-19, including asymptomatic individuals, from spreading it to others, ensuring mask use is widely adopted will help to slow the spread of the virus while ensuring re-opening efforts continue. Please continue reading, or check out our Mandatory Masks By-Law FAQ for more information. Definition of a mask Under the by-law any cloth (non-medical) mask, medical mask or other face covering such as a bandana or scarf may be used, provided it securely covers the nose, mouth and chin without gaps.

Exemptions include: Receiving services Actively engaging in athletic or fitness activity, including water-based activities While actively engaged in delivering vocal artistic performances arranged for by the operator of the establishment Participation in religious rights or ceremonies not compatible with the face being covered Consuming food or drinks Emergency or medical purposes Certain enclosed public spaces are also exempt from the by-law.

Additionally, business owners will be required to post clear and prominent signage at entry points that visitors and employees are required to wear a mask in accordance with the by-law. The policy must be available for inspection by enforcement officers by request, and should outline not only the mask requirement but also the exemptions mentioned above.

Transit is asking its riders, and those visiting its facilities, to wear a mask or face covering. Proper Mask Use Niagara Region Public Health provides the following guidance for effective and safe use of face coverings: Clean your hands before putting a mask on and taking it off. Clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds. Make sure the mask fits. No gaps between the face covering and your face. It should cover your mouth and nose from below the eyes to around the chin. Secure the mask with ties or ear loops so that it is comfortable and doesn't hinder breathing and vision Keep your hands away from your face while wearing a face covering. If you do touch your face, clean your hands immediately. Do not share your mask with others Wear a mask as long as it is comfortable, and remove it when it becomes soiled, damp, damage or difficult to breathe through Wash your cloth face covering in the laundry Continue to stay two metres away from others Clean surfaces that a dirty face covering touches Click here to download Adobe Reader Click here to download Adobe Flash Player Copyright © 2014 The Corporation of the City of St. Catharines AccessibilityCareersCommentsContactsDisclaimersRequirementsSite Map PO Box 3012, 50 Church St., St. Catharines, ON L2R 7C2 City Hall Hours: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Phone & Email Service: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. TTY: 905.688.4TTY(4889) Tel : 905.688.5600 | Fax: 905.682.3631 Designed by eSolutionsGroup"

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Russell Avenue Community Centre All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page.

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Russell Avenue Community Centre All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time.

Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items.

Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Russell Avenue Community Centre All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Mandatory Masks By-law On July 13, 2020, St. Catharines City Council passed By-Law No. 2020-97, requiring that all visitors and staff in enclosed public spaces to wear a face mask or covering at all times. By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page.

Visit the Region's mask by-law page for more information. Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols, and public gatherings of more than five (ten people starting June 12) are prohibited. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program The City has introduced a Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program for St Catharines residential property owners who have been financially affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apply now for COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program. Previously, a payment grace period was introduced for property taxes to support residents and businesses. This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency.

However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Russell Avenue Community Centre All arenas including Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre, Garden City Complex, Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre The Meridian Centre The FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Residents can now book appointments for dates / times beginning on Aug. 10. With limitations on staffing and building occupancy remote service delivery is still preferred.

Mandatory Masks By-law On July 13, 2020, St. Catharines City Council passed By-Law No. 2020-97, requiring that all visitors and staff in enclosed public spaces to wear a face mask or covering at all times. By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page.

Visit the Region's mask by-law page for more information. Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols, and public gatherings of more than five (ten people starting June 12) are prohibited. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program The City has introduced a Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program for St Catharines residential property owners who have been financially affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will extend the second interim property tax and final property tax deadlines of June 30 and July 31 and October 30 to November 30, 2020.* Eligibility: You can only apply for relief for a taxable residential property that is your primary residence.

Applications must be received in our office on or before August 31, 2020, to be considered. *Applicants are encouraged to make any possible payments towards your tax accounts during this period. Apply now for COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program. Previously, a payment grace period was introduced for property taxes to support residents and businesses. This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Residents can now book appointments for dates / times beginning on Aug. 10. With limitations on staffing and building occupancy remote service delivery is still preferred.

Mandatory Masks By-law On July 13, 2020, St. Catharines City Council passed By-Law No. 2020-97, requiring that all visitors and staff in enclosed public spaces to wear a face mask or covering at all times. By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page. Please note: the Niagara Region has also passed a mandatory mask by-law that applies to the entirety of Niagara, with further stipulations and exemptions including the requirement that children five and older wear a face covering. Visit the Region's mask by-law page for more information. Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols, and public gatherings of more than five (ten people starting June 12) are prohibited. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Outside of normal business hours, contact Niagara Region’s dispatch line at 905.984.3690 or 1.877.552.5579. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Never gathering in groups of more than five (ten people starting June 12) people Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program The City has introduced a Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program for St Catharines residential property owners who have been financially affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apply now for COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program. Previously, a payment grace period was introduced for property taxes to support residents and businesses. This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades.

Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City.

This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus.

Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum.

The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

Funding for the grant was provided by FedDev Ontario, a federal program. As small businesses adapt to the challenges posed by COVID-19, enhancing their digital presence is more important than ever. “We are so pleased to once again host the Digital Service Squad Program as it has proven to be a timely initiative and an important part of our recovery efforts to support businesses in our main street areas,” said Brian York, director of Economic Development and Government Relations. “Small businesses are facing overwhelming challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and have had to adapt quickly. The Digital Service Squad program is part of a concerted effort to provide targeted support to small businesses and help shorten the learning curve that comes with getting their business online.” Digital Service Squads were first launched in St. Catharines in 2019 as part of a City-led effort to support businesses in Business Improvement Areas across Niagara. The new program will focus its efforts on downtown St. Catharines, Port Dalhousie, Facer Street and Queenston Street. Established in 2018, Digital Main Street Ontario was recently extended thanks to an investment of $42.5 million from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) and $7.45 million from the Ontario Ministry for Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT). The nearly $50-million investment will help small businesses across Ontario to pivot their operations to include online business models, regain lost revenue and become more resilient and competitive as the economy recovers. The Ontario BIA Association administers the DMS grant program to Ontario’s main street small businesses. “Ontario’s small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the keystone of our economic recovery. That is why we have invested in Digital Main Street to help these enterprises adapt to doing business in a digital world, and take advantage of the record number of people shopping online,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. “Congratulations to St. Catharines on the launch of your Digital Service Squad. The work you’re doing with small businesses in your community will help keep our main streets vibrant, support local jobs and help our economy come back strong.” A fundamental part of Digital Main Street’s success, Digital Service Squads are teams of trained specialists who meet with small businesses, at no cost, to help them improve their online presence. The squads assist with several activities, including developing a Google My Business profile, enhancing their social media presence and providing support for basic website and e-commerce set-up. Squads will also assist qualified small businesses through the application process for a $2,500 Digital Transformation Grant, which includes an online assessment, online training modules and the development of a Digital Transformation Plan (DTP). “The COVID-19 pandemic hit Ontario’s main streets hard, so Digital Main Street is needed more than ever,” said Kay Matthews, executive director of OBIAA. “We know businesses that participated in Digital Main Street last year were better able to cope when the pandemic hit, and we’re excited that FedDev Ontario and Ontario are providing funding to extend this important program to help businesses in communities like St. Catharines.” About OBIAA OBIAA is the network that represents unique and vibrant BIAs across Ontario. The Association supports and advocates on behalf of its members through the building and nurturing of strong relationships and partnerships. OBIAA is a leader in the development and sharing of information, tools, resources and best practices, and is a unified voice on common issues. About Digital Main Street Digital Main Street is an innovative program designed to help main street small businesses achieve digital transformation. The program is built around an online learning platform, structured training programs, grants and Digital Service Squads of experts that help main street small businesses manage and grow their operations through technology adoption. The program was originally created in 2016 by the Toronto Association of BIAs (TABIA) and a group of strategic partners including Google, MasterCard, Microsoft and Shopify. For more information, please visit www.digitalmainstreet.ca. About Digital Main Street Ontario Digital Main Street was expanded across all of Ontario in 2018 with funding from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs through the $38 million Main Street Revitalization Initiative. It has been further extended through funding from FedDev Ontario and the Ontario Ministry for Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT). The new round of funding includes $42.5 million from the Government of Canada’s Regional Relief and Recovery Fund, a national recovery initiative delivered by Canada’s regional development agencies. With $7.45 million from Ontario, this combined federal and provincial project will strengthen Ontario’s economic capacity for innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration, and will promote the development of a strong and diversified Ontario economy.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. At the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic the City began planning for possible resurgences of the virus, examining multiple scenarios, including a large second wave. The St. Catharines Advanced Planning COVID-19 Resurgence Plan aims to mitigate future waves of the virus, while protecting the health and economy of the City and its community. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Geneva Street Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Mandatory Masks By-law On July 13, 2020, St. Catharines City Council passed By-Law No. 2020-97, requiring that all visitors and staff in enclosed public spaces to wear a face mask or covering at all times. By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page. Please note: the Niagara Region has also passed a mandatory mask by-law that applies to the entirety of Niagara, with further stipulations and exemptions including the requirement that children five and older wear a face covering. Visit the Region's mask by-law page for more information. Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols, and public gatherings of more than 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales.

This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice.

Apply now for COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program. Previously, a payment grace period was introduced for property taxes to support residents and businesses. This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug.

The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

Funding for the grant was provided by FedDev Ontario, a federal program. As small businesses adapt to the challenges posed by COVID-19, enhancing their digital presence is more important than ever. “We are so pleased to once again host the Digital Service Squad Program as it has proven to be a timely initiative and an important part of our recovery efforts to support businesses in our main street areas,” said Brian York, director of Economic Development and Government Relations. “Small businesses are facing overwhelming challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and have had to adapt quickly. The Digital Service Squad program is part of a concerted effort to provide targeted support to small businesses and help shorten the learning curve that comes with getting their business online.” Digital Service Squads were first launched in St. Catharines in 2019 as part of a City-led effort to support businesses in Business Improvement Areas across Niagara. The new program will focus its efforts on downtown St. Catharines, Port Dalhousie, Facer Street and Queenston Street. Established in 2018, Digital Main Street Ontario was recently extended thanks to an investment of $42.5 million from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) and $7.45 million from the Ontario Ministry for Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT). The nearly $50-million investment will help small businesses across Ontario to pivot their operations to include online business models, regain lost revenue and become more resilient and competitive as the economy recovers. The Ontario BIA Association administers the DMS grant program to Ontario’s main street small businesses. “Ontario’s small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the keystone of our economic recovery. That is why we have invested in Digital Main Street to help these enterprises adapt to doing business in a digital world, and take advantage of the record number of people shopping online,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. “Congratulations to St. Catharines on the launch of your Digital Service Squad. The work you’re doing with small businesses in your community will help keep our main streets vibrant, support local jobs and help our economy come back strong.” A fundamental part of Digital Main Street’s success, Digital Service Squads are teams of trained specialists who meet with small businesses, at no cost, to help them improve their online presence. The squads assist with several activities, including developing a Google My Business profile, enhancing their social media presence and providing support for basic website and e-commerce set-up. Squads will also assist qualified small businesses through the application process for a $2,500 Digital Transformation Grant, which includes an online assessment, online training modules and the development of a Digital Transformation Plan (DTP). “The COVID-19 pandemic hit Ontario’s main streets hard, so Digital Main Street is needed more than ever,” said Kay Matthews, executive director of OBIAA. “We know businesses that participated in Digital Main Street last year were better able to cope when the pandemic hit, and we’re excited that FedDev Ontario and Ontario are providing funding to extend this important program to help businesses in communities like St. Catharines.” About OBIAA OBIAA is the network that represents unique and vibrant BIAs across Ontario. The Association supports and advocates on behalf of its members through the building and nurturing of strong relationships and partnerships. OBIAA is a leader in the development and sharing of information, tools, resources and best practices, and is a unified voice on common issues. About Digital Main Street Digital Main Street is an innovative program designed to help main street small businesses achieve digital transformation. The program is built around an online learning platform, structured training programs, grants and Digital Service Squads of experts that help main street small businesses manage and grow their operations through technology adoption. The program was originally created in 2016 by the Toronto Association of BIAs (TABIA) and a group of strategic partners including Google, MasterCard, Microsoft and Shopify. For more information, please visit www.digitalmainstreet.ca. About Digital Main Street Ontario Digital Main Street was expanded across all of Ontario in 2018 with funding from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs through the $38 million Main Street Revitalization Initiative. It has been further extended through funding from FedDev Ontario and the Ontario Ministry for Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT). The new round of funding includes $42.5 million from the Government of Canada’s Regional Relief and Recovery Fund, a national recovery initiative delivered by Canada’s regional development agencies. With $7.45 million from Ontario, this combined federal and provincial project will strengthen Ontario’s economic capacity for innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration, and will promote the development of a strong and diversified Ontario economy.

Mayor Walter Sendzik, Councillor Mat Siscoe, the chair of the City’s Budget Standing Committee, and City staff will answer questions about the 2021 draft City budget during the annual Telephone Town Hall on Wednesday, Oct. 28, from 7 to 8 p.m. Now in its sixth year, the Telephone Town Hall operates similar to a radio call-in show, except instead of individuals calling in, the City will call 30,000 households and ask residents to participate. Residents will be randomly called. Anyone who wants to register in advance to participate in the call, or to request not to be called, can do so at www.stcatharines.ca/BudgetTalk or by calling Citizens First at 905.688.5600. Those wishing to have their number added or deleted from the call list must do so before Tuesday, Oct. 27 at noon. “This year’s public input process for the City budget is more critical than ever,” said Coun. Mat Siscoe, chair of the City’s budget committee. “As we continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, it has put additional stress on the City and our residents. We need to hear our residents’ thoughts so we can move forward in a responsible way.” The City also has a budget engagement tool on www.EngageSTC.ca. The EngageSTC budget tool is an opportunity to learn more about the budget; see how familiar residents are with the budget process; and a forum for residents to share ideas or ask questions. The page will be used as an ongoing opportunity for residents to learn more about the budget process and share their feedback as the budget evolves. Budget meetings, being conducted as General Committee this year, are also open to the public. They will be streamed live on the City’s YouTube, and residents are welcome to submit correspondence or delegation requests regarding items on the General Committee agenda. Visit www.stcatharines.ca/bsc for more details. The City also holds a statutory public meeting at City Council, prior to approval, allowing residents to share additional input. “The impact of COVID-19 will be long lasting, and we have some difficult decisions ahead,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “We need to hear from residents what is most important, so we can move forward with recovery and meeting the City’s current and future needs in an affordable, sustainable way.” Visit www.stcatharines.ca/BudgetTalk for more about the Telephone Town Hall and other budget information.

Specifically, the City is inviting residents to weigh in via an online survey that will help guide the development of the 2021-2025 Accessibility Plan, the document that will act as roadmap for continuing accessibility efforts. The City remains committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, and enhancing accessibility by providing integrated services and equitable opportunities while reflecting the principles of dignity and independence. Accessibility planning is reflected in all levels of the City, across the areas of communications and information; customer service; built environments and physical spaces; and employment standards and training. “We want to reflect accessibility in everything we do, it only strengthens us as an organization,” said City Director of Corporate Support Services Jeanette Pillitteri, adding, “we want to go above and beyond what is required of us, and in planning for that we want to hear from the diverse voices that make up our community.” The move to develop a new plan comes as the City wraps up a host of accessibility related efforts under its outgoing Accessibility Plan. In 2019 the City made numerous investments in accessibility including: Accessibility upgrades at about 20 transit stops Installation of eight accessible bus shelters and five benches Expanded paratransit service, including the purchase of a new paratransit vehicle New accessible / inclusive play features, and accessibility upgrades at the Douglas Park and Eastport Park playgrounds Barrier-free spray features at the new Bogart Street Splash Pad Installation of a universal washroom at Russell Avenue Community Centre Finalization of a Museum Interpretive Plan prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility “We’ve made great strides in accessibility, and we want to go further, it’s the next plan, built on public input, that will drive our efforts in the years to come,” said Pillitteri. Residents can visit engagest.ca/AccessibilityPlan and complete the survey to provide their input before 4 p.m. on Oct. 30.

This effort comes alongside others underway to limit the spread of the virus, protect staff and most importantly our residents. On June 3, 2020, City Council endorsed the STC Framework For Recovery outlining the City's path forward toward post-COVID-19 recovery. The framework outlines dozens of action items that will guide the City in reopening of facilities and restoration of services while protecting the health of the community. For more information check out our recovery portal at engageSTC.ca. At the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic the City began planning for possible resurgences of the virus, examining multiple scenarios, including a large second wave. The St. Catharines Advanced Planning COVID-19 Resurgence Plan aims to mitigate future waves of the virus, while protecting the health and economy of the City and its community. What we are doing We have declared a state of emergency. The City of St. Catharines is taking COVID-19 seriously, and in following the advice of provincial and federal leaders is making significant changes to services and programming to help protect health and well being of the community. As a precautionary measure to ensure continued containment of the virus the City has enacted enhanced disinfection efforts at City facilities, and will enact a series of closures. For more information please keep reading, or check out the City's COVID-19 State of Emergency FAQ. State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment beginning Aug. 10 Lake Street Service Centre Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. Service Disruptions and Cancellations As a result of facility closures, and efforts to limit in-person interactions and slow the spread of COVID-19, some City services, programs and activities have been suspended until further notice. Despite these interruptions the City continues to ensure essential services are provided to residents. Inspections inside occupied dwellings remain suspended: inspections will be conducted from the outside of occupied dwellings where applicable.

Residents can now book appointments for dates / times beginning on Aug. 10. With limitations on staffing and building occupancy remote service delivery is still preferred. For a full list of services available by appointment, and more information, please visit our Citizens First page. Mandatory Masks By-law On July 13, 2020, St. Catharines City Council passed By-Law No. 2020-97, requiring that all visitors and staff in enclosed public spaces to wear a face mask or covering at all times. By-law came into effect on July 17, 2020. For more information please visit our Masks By-law page. Please note: the Niagara Region has also passed a mandatory mask by-law that applies to the entirety of Niagara, with further stipulations and exemptions including the requirement that children five and older wear a face covering. Visit the Region's mask by-law page for more information. Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols, and public gatherings of more than 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them via our online form for investigation, or to Citizens First via phone at 905.688.5600 or by email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca. Do not call 911. COVID-19 Orders Noncompliance Complaint Form Victoria Lawn Cemetery Recognizing the importance for many of visiting the graves of loved ones the City of St. Catharines allows access to Victoria Lawn Cemetery during the COVID-19 State of Emergency. This access applies to cemetery business only, specifically: Funeral services Burials Visiting of graves Visitations should be short, and gardening of grave sites will not be permitted. Access is walk in only. Mausoleums are open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. While the cemetery remains accessible for the purposes above the City would like to reiterate that the Victoria Lawn Cemetery should not be used for recreational purposes. Walk-through access is permitted but individuals are asked to be respectful of services and grave-site visitors by avoiding use of the cemetery as a recreational space for activities such as jogging or cycling. If visiting a grave please be sure to follow the recommendations of Public Health officials, and Emergency Orders from the Province by: Maintaining a safe physical separation from others of two metres Short-term parking is available; however, visitors should remember to avoid blocking gates or barricades. With limited parking space please be courteous of others when visiting, and allow room for other vehicles to exit. Emmett Road remains a designated no-parking zone. For more information on safety measures and restrictions on funeral services during the COVID-19 State of Emergency visit our Cemeteries page. Garage Sales The City of St. Catharines strongly discourages hosting of garage sales at this time. While Provincial Emergency Orders don't prohibit yard sales, the orders do prohibit gatherings and public events of more than five individuals. Furthermore the City, and Niagara Region Public Health advise against non-essential travel and activities. The City understands with warm weather returning many residents will be undertaking a spring clean, and with it may want to partake in hosting a yard sale to dispose of unwanted items. This year might be one to consider forgoing the yard sale, given the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with individuals congregating on the lawn, not only to your household, but to those who attend. A garage sale won't only impact your property, it could impact neighbours, creating concerns for their health and well-being as well. Instead individuals should consider selling items online through portals such as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. The Niagara Regional Police offer an Internet Transaction Zone outside the Unit 3 Detachment on Lincoln Street in Welland, providing a safe space for buyers and sellers to meet for online sales. Individuals who still choose to host a garage sale should endeavor to limit the spread of COVID-19 by: Limiting the total number of individuals in attendance to no more than five (ten people starting June 12), themselves included. This must be done to remain in compliance with Provincial Emergency Orders Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing of at least two metres for all in attendance Provide for hand washing / sanitizing Limit physical touching of items for sale Clearly mark prices to limit the need for personal interactions Consider using electronic payment methods such as e-transfers Request exact change Bid and Tenders To assist in the containment of COVID-19 the City will suspend public tender openings until further notice. The City will continue to ensure that unofficial bid results are made available on the City’s Bids and Tenders website. Unofficial results will be made publicly available before the end of business day, on the day of closing. All other processes as outlined in the request for tender document(s) will remain unchanged unless formally amended by addendum. Building Permits Permits are being issued for all type of construction with the following limitations and restrictions: Please be advised that the issuance of this permit is subject to all restrictions and prohibitions under the law. More specifically, this permit does not mean that construction can be carried out in contravention of any Act, Regulation and/or provincial order prohibiting construction deemed non-essential. Please note that you must review the list of construction projects deemed essential and it is recommended that you seek legal opinion to determine whether the project is deemed essential under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) and its Regulations, as amended, before proceeding with construction in order to avoid contravention of the law. Construction projects deemed non-essential are prohibited. Please further note that Inspections will only be carried out on construction projects deemed essential under the EMCPA and its Regulations, as amended. Permit applications are being accepted by mail / courier. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program The City has introduced a Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program for St Catharines residential property owners who have been financially affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will extend the second interim property tax and final property tax deadlines of June 30 and July 31 and October 30 to November 30, 2020.* Eligibility: You can only apply for relief for a taxable residential property that is your primary residence.

Applications must be received in our office on or before August 31, 2020, to be considered. *Applicants are encouraged to make any possible payments towards your tax accounts during this period. Apply now for COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program. Previously, a payment grace period was introduced for property taxes to support residents and businesses. This is replaced by the COVID-19 Property Tax Penalty and Interest Relief Program mentioned above. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments have been deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. City operations Water, sewer, road and core infrastructure maintenance as well as construction that is deemed critical will continue. As well, the City will continue to maintain our buildings, cutting grass in parks and sports field to control weeds, overgrowth and ticks. This will also allow the City to open these facilities more quickly once the emergency is past and ensures no additional costs are incurred to bring parks and fields up to appropriate standards. The City takes the safety of our employees seriously and regularly consults with the Ministry of Labour and the regional, provincial, and federal public health agencies. The City is safeguarding municipal staff by taking a series of measures to limit contact between employees and the public, and minimize exposure to COVID-19. For those employees that are at work, we have taken many steps to minimize the risk, including but not limited to: Staggering shift starting times to minimize the number of staff at dispatch; Increasing the frequency of cleaning our vehicles and facilities; Deploying staff to satellite locations to minimize the number in any one area; Providing hand cleaning stations to all crews; Changing our punch clock operating procedures to a touchless operation; Changing how we do our business to minimize staff interactions. Where possible, separating workplaces using physical distancing guidelines. Many of the essential services that the City provides require the employees to work in crews to perform the work safely. Guidelines around COVID – 19 do not replace existing health and safety regulations. Work that required crews before this emergency, still requires crews during the emergency. St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has reopened to the public. However, visitors must arrange an appointment to visit and tour the facility. Check out the museum's webpage or Facebook page for more information. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen.

In the coming weeks, residents and staff of the City of St. Catharines will notice new garbage, recycling and organic waste bins at City Hall, St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre and Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre. These bins will offer new options for recycling different types of material, as well as organics. “The installation of these bins marks an important first step in our new waste management strategy,” said Director of Engineering, Facilities and Environmental Services Anthony Martuccio. “Our goal is to increase our waste diversion rate by providing better opportunities for staff and residents to dispose of recycling and organic waste.” The installation of the new garbage and recycling bins is part of a pilot project for the City’s Waste Management Strategy, which includes a waste diversion target of 65 per cent at municipal facilities. The pilot consists of removing the single container recycling and garbage bins and replacing them with multi-container bins that further separate recycling. These bins are also being strategically placed throughout facilities in common areas. Additionally, where possible, the City is adding organics bins, which were not in facilities prior to the pilot. The pilot program will have a staged roll out starting with City Hall, the St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre and Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre. Additional City facilities will join the pilot in 2021. Also included in the strategy is the development of a corporate waste management policy and a waste management guide for both staff use and public events.

The first St. Catharines CIP was launched in 2004 in order to offer financial incentive programs to the private sector to stimulate projects that support local community renewal objectives and strategies. The incentives offset a portion of project costs related to redevelopment, reuse and rehabilitation of the built environment. “This latest version of the CIP is a progressive plan in alignment with the City’s Strategic Plan and the land use framework established in our Official Plan,” said Senior Planner Bruce Bellows. “It takes a proactive approach to revitalizing, reshaping and positioning our City as an attractive place to live and do business.” Since 2004, the City has approved 98 CIP applications with a commitment of approximately $20.75 million. Once all projects are completed as approved, they will represent the generation of approximately 2,100 new residential dwelling units, 280 permanent new jobs and an estimated increase in property tax assessment of approximately $396 million. The previous CIP, which was released in 2015, offered five financial incentive programs to the private sector to stimulate new investment in community renewal projects including brownfield remediation, building facade improvement and rehabilitation of vacant building space. In spring of 2019 the City paused the CIP to undertake a full review of the program and its alignment with strategic plan objectives, long-term sustainability and maximizing value. With the review complete, City Council has now signed off on changes that include a greater emphasis on redevelopment projects that include provision for affordable housing, rehabilitation of commercial buildings and aging plazas, heritage preservation and restoration, and brownfield remediation. Formal passage of the by-law will be before Council on Nov. 16. Following the legislated procedures, the new CIP is expected to come into effect mid-December 2020.

Some facilities have reopened to the public with enhanced safety measures, such as screening of staff, physical distancing measures, masks requirements, appointment-only access, occupancy limits, frequent disinfection protocols and other protocols. COVID-19 continues to present a threat to the health and safety of our community. We all have a part to play in slowing the spread. Please follow the advice of Public Health, Provincial recommendations and regulations. Current Province of Ontario COVID-19 response framework level: Orange-Restrict State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment Lake Street Service Centre Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

A Transportation Master Plan is a long-range strategy that will ultimately guide the future of transportation within St. Catharines to support community growth. Designed as a strategy to assist City staff to proactively plan for the future of the City, the TMP supports infrastructure implementation, behaviour change and policy directions. “The TMP will guide the future of transportation with long-term goals of community resilience, growth, health, and environmental sustainability,” said Manager of Transportation Services Brian Applebee. “This is a new vision for transportation in St. Catharines that involves innovative ideas and recommendations.” The TMP is being developed using a ‘complete streets’ approach, which Applebee describes as the foundation upon which decisions can be made to implement facilities, routes and corridors designed for people of all ages, abilities and modes of travel including walking, cycling, taking transit and driving. “A well-designed complete street-based Transportation Master Plan will promote activity, livability and connectivity and result in a network of transportation infrastructure and services that enables people to travel seamlessly to their destination of choice using any given mode of transportation,” added Applebee. To-date, the City has gathered input from interactive online engagement tools, engagement pop-ups at Brock University, working sessions with internal and external stakeholders and public input sessions. The draft TMP recommendations will be presented to the community on Dec. 3, 2020, via an online meeting, which the City will stream on YouTube. This will not be a meeting of Council but an opportunity for the TMP project team to communicate draft recommendations to the public and receive input. Input from the public following this meeting will be used to inform potential refinements to the draft recommendations and to identify key considerations that should be addressed prior to finalizing the TMP and bringing it forward to Council for adoption in the first quarter of 2021. To find out more about the TMP and register to participate in the Public Input Session on Dec. 3, visit www.engageSTC.ca/TMP.

The first St. Catharines CIP was launched in 2004 in order to offer financial incentive programs to the private sector to stimulate projects that support local community renewal objectives and strategies. The incentives offset a portion of project costs related to redevelopment, reuse and rehabilitation of the built environment. “This latest version of the CIP is a progressive plan in alignment with the City’s Strategic Plan and the land use framework established in our Official Plan,” said Senior Planner Bruce Bellows. “It takes a proactive approach to revitalizing, reshaping and positioning our City as an attractive place to live and do business.” Since 2004, the City has approved 98 CIP applications with a commitment of approximately $20.75 million. Once all projects are completed as approved, they will represent the generation of approximately 2,100 new residential dwelling units, 280 permanent new jobs and an estimated increase in property tax assessment of approximately $396 million. The previous CIP, which was released in 2015, offered five financial incentive programs to the private sector to stimulate new investment in community renewal projects including brownfield remediation, building facade improvement and rehabilitation of vacant building space. In spring of 2019 the City paused the CIP to undertake a full review of the program and its alignment with strategic plan objectives, long-term sustainability and maximizing value. With the review complete, City Council has now signed off on changes that include a greater emphasis on redevelopment projects that include provision for affordable housing, rehabilitation of commercial buildings and aging plazas, heritage preservation and restoration, and brownfield remediation. Formal passage of the by-law will be before Council on Nov. 16. Following the legislated procedures, the new CIP is expected to come into effect mid-December 2020.

As we emerge from the impacts of COVID-19 on our community, the recent decisions of Council will help drive our collective return to prosperity.” Changes to the City’s Official Plan were triggered by direction to study the potential redevelopment of industrial land located at 282 to 285 Ontario Street to allow for mixed-use purposes. This change required an amendment to the Official Plan, and as such a comprehensive city-wide Land Needs Assessment was completed by the City’s Planning and Building Services department. “This latest version of the Official Plan represents three years of dedicated research, growth management calculations, policy analysis and collaboration with the Province, Region, public and stakeholders to ensure our city has adequate lands for employment, population and housing targets to 2041 and beyond,” said Director of Planning and Building Services Tami Kitay. The city is expected to grow by roughly 31,000 people by 2041, which according to the Land Needs Assessment will require over 14,000 new dwelling units to accommodate that growth. The City is also expected to accommodate for the provision of 18,000 new jobs during this time. The recommendations approved at Council mean the re-designation of 60 hectares of Employment Land to Mixed Use Land, which will provide for a variety of housing and employment opportunities. This included the properties at 282 to 285 Ontario and lands west and south of the Niagara Health St. Catharines site on Fourth Avenue. “These changes reflect a very significant re-alignment to the City’s land-use structure and landscape,” said Senior City Planner Bruce Bellows. “They provide opportunities for new housing, jobs and accommodation of growth within our finite urban area, and as such, enabling protection of our world class agricultural lands at the same time. The changes provide a balance towards complete community, and a footprint for sustainable growth management for the benefit of future generations.” Changes to the City of St. Catharines’ Official Plan will now go before the Niagara Region for final approval.

Some facilities have reopened to the public with enhanced safety measures, such as screening of staff, physical distancing measures, masks requirements, appointment-only access, occupancy limits, frequent disinfection protocols and other protocols. COVID-19 continues to present a threat to the health and safety of our community. We all have a part to play in slowing the spread. Please follow the advice of Public Health, Provincial recommendations and regulations. Current Province of Ontario COVID-19 response framework level: Orange-Restrict State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facility Closures Currently closed City facilities include: St. Catharines City Hall: select services open by appointment Lake Street Service Centre Buchanan House Morningstar Mill / Decew Falls All of the City's fire stations All Older Adult Centres including Dunlop Drive, West St. Catharines, and Port Dalhousie Bill Burgoyne, Merritton Centennial and Haig Bowl arenas Happy Rolph's Animal Farm: site open for outdoor recreational use, animals not present The Meridian Centre Merritton Community Centre St. Catharines Enterprise Centre Lakeside Park Carousel While city facilities are closed to the public, residents can still access City services online, or contact Citizens First by emailing citizensfirst@stcatharines.ca or calling 905-688-5600, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Alternative options for those needing to make a payment can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions.

Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Avoid gatherings of over five people Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Facilities COVID-19 screening is currently required to access all City facilities.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

On Monday, City Council approved the 2021 Operating and Capital Budgets, representing a 1.86 per cent increase to the municipal portion of property tax in the year ahead for the median home. The modest increase comes as the City continues to see an upswing in operational costs and decreased revenues as a result of COVID-19. Specifically, in 2021, the City projects non-tax revenue decreases of roughly 4.5 per cent, while at the same time an increase in operational costs of roughly $574,000, both largely related to the pandemic. In addition, other revenues related to City facility operations, such as the Meridian Centre and parking operations, are also being impacted. In total these items amount to a roughly $4.2 million impact on the 2021 budget, representing a roughly 3.9 per cent increase to the budget over 2020. Recognizing that many households have seen their finances adversely impacted by COVID-19 the City has made every effort to prevent the above financial pressures from being passed on to taxpayers in 2021. The City used increased transfers from reserves — $2.7 million from the Civic Project Fund; $160,000 from the Hydro Reserve Fund; and $157,700 from the Tax Stabilization Reserve — in addition to a $1.9 million decrease in capital project funding from the Operating Budget to offset COVID-19 related costs to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on taxes. For the average homeowner, with a property value assessed at $254,000, the City portion of the property tax bill will increase by 1.86 per cent, amounting to an additional $29.98 for the year. “The 2021 budget represents a balanced approach to ensure fiscal sustainability for our City, while at the same time delivering essential municipal services and supporting our community’s needs as we look to recovery once COVID-19 is contained,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “Thank you to City staff, Budget Chair Mat Siscoe and to Council for their efforts to table a responsible budget that addresses pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.” While the City managed to keep increases low, the 2021 budget still represents progress toward the strategic goals of building social wellbeing, economic prosperity, environmental stewardship and culture in the city. Important infrastructure investments, under the $40.3-million 2021 Capital Budget, will continue in the year ahead. The 2021 Capital Budget includes $8.2 million in roads investment, including $1.8 million for the reconstruction of St. David’s Road and Townline Road; $4.1 million for Community, Recreation and Culture Services, including $1 million for city-wide trail improvements and an additional $1.2 million for active transportation priorities such as bike trails; $1.5 million for shoreline protection; and $5.1 million for buildings and facilities, including $1.2 million in upgrades at Merritton Arena. “This was a very challenging budget year, and our residents should be proud of all the work that has gone into development of a budget that offsets the financial impacts of COVID-19, not only for the City but for taxpayers,” said Chief Administrative Officer Shelley Chemnitz, adding, “at the same time we continue to make important investments in the future of our City and to deliver the important services our residents rely on every day.” “There were a lot of competing priorities this year, and I want to commend staff and Council for building a budget that balances the needs of the community in maintaining services while relieving residents from any large increases in their tax bills during this difficult time,” said Budget Standing Committee Chair Coun. Mat Siscoe.

State of Emergency On April 3, 2020, the City of St. Catharines, along with the Region and other Niagara municipalities declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a surge of local cases of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments were deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

We need to make this lockdown effective by staying home – period. Let’s aim to start 2021 with a reduction in cases that will point the way for a much better year for everyone.” The City’s approach to the shutdown is based on limiting contact where possible, responding to the social, mental and physical needs of the community, maintaining enhanced safety protocols, and offering innovative ways to stay connected to the community via virtual programs. “The City is doing everything possible to ensure our community stays safe and healthy and we look forward to welcoming everyone back as soon as possible,” said Director of Community, Recreation and Culture Services Phil Cristi. Based on direction from the Province, the following will be instituted as part of province-wide shutdown: City Hall Access to services at City Hall, such as Citizens First Customer Service, will continue to be available by appointment only Where possible, services will be provided through remote means St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre Closed to the public Farmers Market Open Saturdays only, 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., with enhanced safety measures One patron per vendor Increased facility monitors will be onsite to manage lines Masks are required Local food vendors only Arenas Closed to the public Community Centres (Russell Avenue and Port Weller) Closed to the public Older Adult Centres Closed to the public St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre Closed to the public Contact aquatics@stcatharines.ca to request refunds St. Catharines Public Library Closed until Jan. 3, 2021 Holds pickup only starting Jan. 4, 2021 Recreational Programming In-person programming cancelled until further notice The City will continue to deliver virtual programming and connecting with older adults via phone In addition to the Framework guidance, members of the public are reminded of the following: Restrict close contacts to your household members only and essential supports. Those who live alone may join with another household for support. All in-person activities should be limited outside of the home to essential activities only, this includes work, school, fitness and exercise, access to healthcare, and the purchase of food or drink, gasoline, and automobile maintenance.

Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Mayor, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why are we declaring an emergency? We want to highlight how serious the COVID-19 situation is, and the importance of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. The actions the City, and residents, take over the coming weeks will be critical if a rapid increase in cases is to be prevented. Rapid local transmission could overwhelm the health care system and have dramatic impacts on the health of residents and City staff, possibly impacting the delivery of services. The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City is continuing with its current efforts such as facility closures while continue its ongoing efforts to deliver important services to its residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments were deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

We need to make this lockdown effective by staying home – period. Let’s aim to start 2021 with a reduction in cases that will point the way for a much better year for everyone.” The City’s approach to the shutdown is based on limiting contact where possible, responding to the social, mental and physical needs of the community, maintaining enhanced safety protocols, and offering innovative ways to stay connected to the community via virtual programs. “The City is doing everything possible to ensure our community stays safe and healthy and we look forward to welcoming everyone back as soon as possible,” said Director of Community, Recreation and Culture Services Phil Cristi. Based on direction from the Province, the following will be instituted as part of province-wide shutdown: City Hall Access to services at City Hall, such as Citizens First Customer Service, will continue to be available by appointment only Where possible, services will be provided through remote means St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre Closed to the public Farmers Market Open Saturdays only, 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., with enhanced safety measures One patron per vendor Increased facility monitors will be onsite to manage lines Masks are required Local food vendors only Arenas Closed to the public Community Centres (Russell Avenue and Port Weller) Closed to the public Older Adult Centres Closed to the public St. Catharines Kiwanis Aquatics Centre Closed to the public Contact aquatics@stcatharines.ca to request refunds St. Catharines Public Library Closed until Jan. 3, 2021 Holds pickup only starting Jan. 4, 2021 Recreational Programming In-person programming cancelled until further notice The City will continue to deliver virtual programming and connecting with older adults via phone In addition to the Framework guidance, members of the public are reminded of the following: Restrict close contacts to your household members only and essential supports.

Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. During a special meeting on Friday, March 27, Council approved a series of measures aimed at supporting residents and businesses with the costs of municipal taxes and services. The approved measures, which include some previously announced, are as follows: Deferring the April 30 interim tax instalment to June 30; June 30 to July 31; and Sept. 30 to Oct. 30 Waiving tax penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving water and wastewater penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving accounts receivable penalty and interest charges until June 30 Waiving charges for any cheques or pre-authorized payments returned for non-sufficient funds or payments stopped by the payer Amending the 2020 final tax levy instalment dates to July 31 and October 30 Deferring the 2020 water and wastewater increase from April 1 to Aug. Waiving payment for on-street parking, municipal parking lots and garages Suspending any water service disconnections for non-payment of water and wastewater billings until June 30 Waiving late fees for 2020 dog licences Waiving late fees for 2020 general business licences Pre-authorized payments for tax instalments were deferred until June 30 but monthly pre-authorized payments will continue unless suspended in writing by the payer. The City will continue to process pre-authorized payments for water, unless suspended in writing by the payer. If you have any further questions related to the deferal of April interim tax instalments check out our Tax Payment Deferal FAQ. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever New cough Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, and rarely, death How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Self isolation Individuals asked or ordered to self isolate due to recent travel or possible exposure should: Not go to work, child care, or other public areas for 14 days If you develop symptoms within 14 days of your self-isolation period, you must remain in self-isolation for an additional 14 days from the day your symptoms started OR 24 hours after your symptoms have stopped, whichever is longer Separate themselves from others from others Sleep in a separate room Have a bathroom in your home dedicated to only you (if possible) Maintain a distance of two metres from other people Not have guests or visitors over Clean hands often Not use public transportation, ride sharing companies or taxis Cancel non-urgent appointments until the end of the monitoring period Avoid close contact with others, including those in their home as much as possible Make alternate arrangements to support children and other dependents Ask a friend or family member to help get a supply of groceries and other necessities, the isolating individual(s) should not under any circumstances go themselves Individuals in self-isolation who need to go out for any reason, call the Public Health Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Info Line at 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or 1-888-505-6074, and a nurse will provide you with detailed instructions to follow.

Specifically, City Council has approved a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12-month period. Applications are now open for the program and must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. The application-based program allows for all property-tax payers, including both owners and tenants, to pay their outstanding 2020 tax account, including any penalty and interest charged, in addition to their 2021 taxes, through pre-authorized payments over 12 equal instalments. These instalments will be paid on the 15th of each month from Feb. 15, 2021 to Jan. 15, 2022. No penalty and interest would be charged for accounts on this pre-authorized plan. “For those property owners who are facing financial challenges as a result of the pandemic this provides some flexibility and relief,” said City Treasurer Kristine Douglas, adding, “not only does it allow for these individuals to avoid penalties and interest, but it allows for payments to be spread across more manageable sums.” Those applying for the program will be expected to provide proof of financial hardships experienced as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, landlords whose tenants make property tax payments will be expected to allow such tenants to undertake the application process and access the program.

We need to make this lockdown effective by staying home – period. Let’s aim to start 2021 with a reduction in cases that will point the way for a much better year for everyone.” The City’s approach to the shutdown is based on limiting contact where possible, responding to the social, mental and physical needs of the community, maintaining enhanced safety protocols, and offering innovative ways to stay connected to the community via virtual programs. “The City is doing everything possible to ensure our community stays safe and healthy and we look forward to welcoming everyone back as soon as possible,” said Director of Community, Recreation and Culture Services Phil Cristi.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

Council approved both measures on Monday night, bolstering the extensive work of several City departments in supporting local businesses. With the hopes of drawing more shoppers to the downtown and other commercial areas for their essential needs, parking in all City lots, garages and on-street spaces will be free until the end of April. For more information on parking visit stcatharines.ca/Parking. While parking will be free, the City will continue to enforce parking restrictions related to safety, such as fire routes, as well as restrictions for loading zones and curbside pickup spaces. Additionally, the City’s temporary outdoor patio program will continue until the end of 2021. The program, first introduced in spring 2020, allows restaurant and bar operators to expand outdoor business areas to offset limitations on indoor dining under COVID-19 emergency orders. Staff will also examine the return of temporary downtown road closures during the warmer months to allow for expanded patio operations on weekends. “The impacts of the pandemic have been particularly hard on our local small businesses that play such an important role in the functioning of a robust local economy, delivering jobs, and helping to maintain our city as the vibrant destination it has become,” said Director of Economic Development Brian York, adding, “the hospitality sector especially has seen severe impacts which the City is working to offset through the means it has available.” The return of free parking and extension of the patio program enhances ongoing work on behalf of the City to aid local business, such as the PickupSTC.ca project, recently expanded to LoveSTC.ca, providing a one-stop online portal for residents to access and shop local businesses providing curbside pickup and online services. The City’s economic development team, together with partners, has launched a host of initiatives under its Pandemic Recovery Plan, including the extension of the Digital Mainstreet program; reinvention of downtown events, such as the STC Holiday Square, to bring residents downtown in a safe environment; and advocacy / marketing efforts.

Nominations open today, Jan. 22, for the City’s annual Volunteer and MyHoodSTC Awards. The awards, returning this year in a digital format, will recognize volunteers and good neighbours from across the city during Canada’s National Volunteer Week from April 18 to 24. “This year has been a trying one for a community, and, despite all the challenges there are individuals who have stepped up day after day to help carry our community through these challenges,” said Community and Events Supervisor Brianne Wilson, adding, “these are real heroes that keep our community moving forward, they build our community and inspire others to do the same with their dedication.” Volunteer awards are divided into three categories, the Volunteer Recognition Award; Mayor’s Adult Volunteer of the Year; and the Margaret and Robin MacLennan Youth Volunteer of the Year Award. “Young and old alike, our community is filled with dedicated and compassionate volunteers, we’re looking to residents to nominate these individuals and help us share their stories,” said Wilson. The MyHoodSTC Awards will also return, recognizing two residents — one Youth Award and one Connection Award — from each of the city’s six wards. The MyHoodSTC Awards recognize those who have made a difference in the neighbourhood they call home. The MyHoodSTC Youth Award applies to individuals under 25 years of age who have taken on leadership roles in their neighbourhoods, while the Connection Award salutes those who have initiated efforts and activities improving the quality of life, culture, and/or inclusivity in their neighbourhoods.

Council approved both measures on Monday night, bolstering the extensive work of several City departments in supporting local businesses. With the hopes of drawing more shoppers to the downtown and other commercial areas for their essential needs, parking in all City lots, garages and on-street spaces will be free until the end of April. For more information on parking visit stcatharines.ca/Parking. While parking will be free, the City will continue to enforce parking restrictions related to safety, such as fire routes, as well as restrictions for loading zones and curbside pickup spaces. Additionally, the City’s temporary outdoor patio program will continue until the end of 2021. The program, first introduced in spring 2020, allows restaurant and bar operators to expand outdoor business areas to offset limitations on indoor dining under COVID-19 emergency orders. Staff will also examine the return of temporary downtown road closures during the warmer months to allow for expanded patio operations on weekends. “The impacts of the pandemic have been particularly hard on our local small businesses that play such an important role in the functioning of a robust local economy, delivering jobs, and helping to maintain our city as the vibrant destination it has become,” said Director of Economic Development Brian York, adding, “the hospitality sector especially has seen severe impacts which the City is working to offset through the means it has available.” The return of free parking and extension of the patio program enhances ongoing work on behalf of the City to aid local business, such as the PickupSTC.ca project, recently expanded to LoveSTC.ca, providing a one-stop online portal for residents to access and shop local businesses providing curbside pickup and online services. The City’s economic development team, together with partners, has launched a host of initiatives under its Pandemic Recovery Plan, including the extension of the Digital Mainstreet program; reinvention of downtown events, such as the STC Holiday Square, to bring residents downtown in a safe environment; and advocacy / marketing efforts.

""Council recognizes the challenges local businesses have experienced during the ongoing pandemic. Small businesses are vital to the backbone of our economy and this is just one of the few tools the City has to support them and try to reduce the financial burden,"" said Mayor Walter Sendzik. ""This is a small, but important, move to assist them as we continue to navigate the pandemic and enter recovery."" Business Licence fees for 2021 will be waived for amusement arcades, auctioneers, hawker/peddlers (e.g. food trucks), public halls, refreshment stands, restaurants and theatres. “The types of businesses included in the waiving of fees are based on the anticipated impact that COVID-19 will have on them during 2021,” said City Clerk Bonnie Nistico-Dunk. “Not being able to hold their annual events, programs or welcome residents into their establishments has been very difficult and this is something we can do at a municipal level to lessen the burden.” The motion passed by Council to waive 2021 business licence fees will have an estimated cost of $92,000 on the City’s budget.

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19?

On Monday City Council approved a motion that will see the City certified as a living wage employer. St. Catharines already meets the support level of requirements, meaning all its full-time employees are paid a living wage of at least $18.12 an hour. As part of this certification the City has pledged to meet champion level requirements by 2024. These requirements would see all part-time staff and employees of City contractors brought up to at least this minimum threshold for a living wage by 2024. “Council is proud to support the City of St. Catharines becoming a Living Wage certified employer,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “We join a growing list of Niagara companies that believe in the principles of a living wage as a means to generate greater economic opportunity for everyone, and to call attention to this vital quality-of-life measure. Thank you to Couns. Porter and Miller for leading this initiative.” A living wage is calculated by the Ontario Living Wage Network to show how much a household – two adults working full-time supporting two small children – must earn per hour in order to make ends meet and enjoy modest participation in their civic and cultural community. The commitment to a living wage is an extension of the City’s social strategic goal to build strong, inclusive neighbourhoods, providing a high quality of life for all residents. The City is the fifth Ontario municipality to undergo certification, joining 16 other Living Wage employers across St. Catharines and 46 across the region. Beyond providing for its own employees, the City hopes to lead other employers in the community by example. ""Public sector employers are important employers to the local economy. By paying a living wage, the City of St. Catharines is taking action to address working poverty in the community. The unanimous vote of the St. Catharines city council to seek certification for paying a living wage sets a strong example for employers in the community, region and province,” said Ontario Living Wage Network Program Manager Anne Coleman. The Niagara Poverty Reduction Network (NPRN), which has spearheaded local living wage certification efforts, was quick to praise the City for its leadership. “The City of St. Catharines deserves congratulations and thanks for moving toward becoming a living wage employer. NPRN began working with the City in hopes of achieving this goal three years ago. We’re delighted to see the result. No one should have to live in poverty,” said NPRN Chair Aidan Johnson.

On Monday night, following a public meeting on proposed 2021 water / wastewater rates, Council approved the 2021 Water and Wastewater Budget, including $6.9 million in contributions to capital infrastructure replacements and investments. While some capital spending prescribed under the City’s 10-year water and wastewater financial plan will be pushed back to offset the financial impacts of COVID-19, the City will continue to meet the standards of service residents rely on. “Clean, affordable drinking water is something every resident relies on,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “Thank you to our team for developing a budget that allows us to maintain and enhance our water and wastewater infrastructure, while at the same time ensuring rates remain affordable.” In total $4.5 million will be contributed to watermain replacement, aiding in the prevention of water loss due to aging infrastructure, and about $2.4 million will be directed to sanitary sewer replacement and pollution control projects. These investments will continue to ensure residents can rely on safe drinking water delivered by the City in an environmentally sustainable way. Infrastructure investments, alongside increasing Regional water costs, will see the average homeowner paying an additional $16.14 for water / wastewater in 2021. This increase is smaller than in recent years as the City continues efforts to offset costs for homeowners dealing with the financial impacts of the pandemic. Even with a slight increase St. Catharines water / wastewater rates are the third lowest in Niagara. “We recognize for everyone this is a challenging year, and while we are keeping rate increases low, we are continuing to make investments into the water-wastewater system, ensuring our residents can continue to turn on the tap and trust the water delivered is not only affordable but up to the highest standards of quality and cleanliness,” said City Treasurer Kristine Douglas. The Water and Wastewater Budget includes money paid to the Niagara Region for operation of its portion of the water / wastewater system, totalling roughly $35.3 million. This amount charged by the Region, which increased by 3.7 per cent this year, represents 63 per cent of the overall Water and Wastewater Budget expenditures.

They are especially seeking farmers and/or those that produce products containing locally grown ingredients, to ensure balance and diversity of products at the market. Each week the market offers consumers direct access to local foods at the peak of their freshness and flavour, along with a wide variety of other items, including flowers, handmade goods, VQA wines and more. While the market operates year-round, spring and summer see the market bloom into its busiest season, packed full of local bounty – some harvested just before the market day. “Seeing local growers and producers interact with consumers, feature their high-quality products and share their stories with the community is one of the best features of our market. It’s a vibrant place to be on market day,” adds Chakarova. “Our visitors want to talk to the people who grow their food, and they want to support local agriculture and the local economy.” Applications and full details on the market, including a list of existing vendors, rules and regulations, selection criteria and market stall rental rates can be found online at www.stcatharines.ca/farmersmarket. Applications are open until March 22.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

On Monday, City Council unanimously approved the establishment of a full-time permanent diversity, equity and inclusion staff position for the City of St. Catharines. The position, which was approved on International Women’s Day, will enhance the ongoing work to increase diversity and inclusion in City operations, and the community at large. “It’s fitting that this decision was made on International Women’s Day, a time when we stop and reflect on the roles of women as leaders and role models in our community and the work that needs to be done to not only recognize and improve gender diversity, but diversity and inclusion as a whole - be it sexual orientation, race, or ability,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik, adding, “this decision builds on the foundation the City of St. Catharines has created to establish ourselves as an inclusive and compassionate community. It is an investment that ensures our efforts continue with a whole new, and strengthened, lens of equity and inclusion.” The new position builds on numerous diversity initiatives, including the signing of the Leadership Accord on Gender Diversity and the work of the City’s LGBTQ2+, Anti-Racism, and Equity and Inclusion Advisory Committees. Acting as a liaison for these committees the new position will allow these committees to better utilize the diverse skill sets and abilities of City staff in their efforts, while providing specialized expertise in the area to advance corporate equity and inclusion initiatives. The City remains committed to building a community that respects and celebrates diversity, inclusiveness, and equity in all its efforts.

With this in mind, the City will begin enforcing the three-hour time limit for on-street parking and surface lots starting Wednesday, March 17. The move comes as the City continues to offer free parking at on-street spaces, lots and garages in support of local businesses. Ongoing free parking has seen some individuals who would typically park in garages downtown for extended periods moving to on-street spaces and surface lots, causing a reduction in turnover at these spaces and in turn reducing the amount of available parking for patrons accessing businesses. “We’re not doing away with free parking, but there is a need for a bit tighter enforcement,” said Manager of Revenue Lisa Read, adding, “this will allow us to continue to ensure residents can easily access downtown businesses and services, while ensuring varying parking needs are met by the right resources.” Those wishing to park for periods longer than three hours can still park free of charge at the Ontario Street and Carlisle Street Garages. Parking at on-street spaces, surface lots and garages will remain free until April 30, 2021. Ahead of the reintroduction of time limits the City will undertake an education campaign to ensure downtown visitors are aware of the change. The City will continue to enforce safety-related parking restrictions such as those for fire routes, accessible parking spaces and loading zones.

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens.

Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

It’s important we support their efforts so our residents can continue to enjoy the vibrant, compassionate and creative city we have become.” Applications are currently open for the SCCIP Culture Days Activity Program; Core and Midsized Sustaining Programs; Arts Development Program; and Culture Builds Community Program. With an application deadline of March 25, the Culture Days Activity Program supports artists, organizations and businesses who are planning to run events related to Culture Days, a month-long national celebration of creativity and the arts from Sept. 24 to Oct. 24.

This funding supports St. Catharines-based, established professional non-profit arts organizations with a mission to develop, create, produce, present, and disseminate artistic work in any artistic discipline.

Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19?

Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

On Monday, City Council approved the adoption of a new Transportation Master Plan. The document is the product of extensive public consultation — including technical workshops, in-person open houses and online information sessions — and study that first began in 2017. The TMP will provide a roadmap for the development of new transportation infrastructure and redevelopment for decades to come, with an eye towards meeting changing transportation needs; increased active transportation; public transit use; and changing technologies. “We’re taking a user-focussed approach to the future of transportation in our city, the TMP ensures we are ready for shifting needs and modes of transportation while delivering on long-term goals of community resilience, growth, health, and environmental sustainability,” said Manager of Transportation Services Brian Applebee. To do that the plan takes a complete street approach, creating space for not just traditional car-based traffic, but transportation avenues for active transportation such as cycling and pedestrians. The plan puts pedestrians first as the City works to create walkable, sustainable neighbourhoods. It’s a lens through which new transportation corridors can be designed and existing street redevelopment can deliver on the goals of: Support for the local economy and tourism initiatives Opportunities for passive physical activity Development of vibrant communities through integrated transportation and land-use planning Increase efficiency for existing rights of way Access and mobility for individuals of all ages and abilities Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions Balancing multiple modes of transportation Improved road safety “The traditional ways in which we view transportation are changing, here in the city, the region, and the province. From the ground floor we need to be looking at the transportation network from the outside in, meaning focusing on the most vulnerable of users first before the vehicular modes,” said Applebee, adding, “balancing the needs of sustainable transportation modes, while also accommodating the cars, trucks and buses that drive commerce and business, is at the core of the complete streets approach, an approach that will leave our transportation system ready for the future.” Several areas of the plan were modified Monday night. Revisions include the removal of a Municipal Class Environmental Assessment that would allow for a potential roadway from Scott Street to YMCA Drive through John Page Park. “Council took a transformational step in addressing climate change with its approval of the Transportation Master Plan,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “The last plan of this nature was developed 55 years ago. This new plan will guide future Councils and staff on how we build a city that is less dependant on cars and more focused on all kinds of movement abilities from pedestrians to cycling to enhanced transit. Compliments to City staff for getting this long overdue strategic plan completed.” Development of the plan was funded in part by the Federal Gas Tax Fund (FGTF). The Federal Gas Tax Fund is a permanent and stable source of funding for municipal infrastructure. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario delivers the Fund directly to Ontario’s municipalities, except Toronto, twice a year, on a per capita basis.

Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

With a draft being finalized for a new Climate Adaptation Plan (CAP), the City of St. Catharines is hosting an online open house from April 30 to May 14, allowing residents the opportunity to review the plan, ask questions and provide feedback. “While we are working as an organization to do our part in preventing climate change through emission reduction targets and other initiatives, we must be prepared for the impacts that are already coming with a changing climate,” said Climate Change Adaptation Coordinator Olivia Groff, adding, “the Climate Adaptation Plan does just that, shoring up City resources and processes against the projected impacts of climate change to protect both City assets and the health and safety of residents.” Based on the latest climate projections, by 2050 St. Catharines will experience hotter summers; warmer and wetter winters; longer and wetter springs; and shorter falls, all driving increased extreme weather events including flooding, heat waves and intense winter storms. Building on two rounds of public engagement through the Niagara Adapts partnership with Brock University and other Niagara municipalities, the CAP outlines six goals: Prepare for hotter and drier summers Prepare for and respond to extreme weather events Develop a flood prevention strategy Improve stormwater management including the use of green infrastructure Prepare for high Lake Ontario water levels Re-think how the City addresses Climate Change Based on these goals, 28 action items have been developed, ranging from increasing the urban tree canopy to shoreline protection.

Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Vaccine delivery in Niagara is being overseen by Niagara Region Public Health. For information on vaccine delivery, eligibility, booking and more please visit Public Health's vaccine page.

On Monday night, City Council approved a Licensing and Administrative Monetary Penalty System (AMPS) for STRs, such as those operated through online portals like AirBnB and VRBO. These new tools compliment amendments made to the City’s Zoning By-law late in 2020 that redefined STRs as home-based businesses. The amendments, combined with licensing and AMPS, will allow the City to better regulate, and enforce compliance with City by-laws, as they relate to STRs. Both will be phased into effect starting January 2022. Until that time STRs are not permitted under the City’s Zoning By-law. Short-term rental operations have historically not been permitted in residences in St. Catharines. Certain properties operating as STRs became frequent sites of complaints related to noise, parking, property standards and waste. In 2019 the City began extensive public consultation and research on how to best regulate STRs and address problems with some operators. The Zoning By-law amendments moved STRs into the regulatory framework by permitting them in residences provided they operate as a home-based business at the operator’s primary residence. This effectively means operators will only be able to operate an STR as a secondary use from one residence, specifically the unit they live in. This addresses issues of full-time STRs absorbing housing stock, while still allowing homeowners to gain ancillary income through renting of their home. “This is a tremendous step towards a better housing landscape in our City. Our residents can still rent their home if they are headed out of town, and visitors to the region can still utilize short-term rentals,” said Director of Planning and Building Services Tami Kitay, adding, “at the same time we can better enforce rules surrounding STRs, penalizing those few bad actors, and ensure residential areas continue to provide long-term housing options for those who call the City home.” Monday’s addition of Licensing and AMPS rounds out the regulatory framework, requiring STR operators to apply for a licence with the City, ensuring the properties follow various City by-laws, the Fire Code, Building Code and other safety regulations. The creation of an AMPS provides the City with enforcement mechanisms related to by-law and licensing compliance, allowing for monetary penalties to be leveed through an internal process. In addition to monetary penalties through the AMPS the licensing by-law establishes a system of demerit points associated with various infractions ranging from Fire and Building Code violations to waste, parking and noise related issues. Infractions carry point weights ranging from two to 10 points. Demerit points will remain active against a licence for two years, with penalties, including licence suspension, incurred based on demerit point totals. “The development of this Short Term Rental licensing and regulation program is a strong step forward to better addressing some of the issues we’ve seen increasing over the years – including noise and property standards complaints, parking issues and more associated with STRs,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “Thanks to City staff for getting this new program in place and to Councillor Bill Phillips for his advocacy and leadership on this issue.” As the system is phased in, three new by-law enforcement officers will be brought on board in 2022, allowing for enhanced by-law enforcement on evenings and weekends when STR issues typically occur. These officers will expand the City’s by-law enforcement complement, addressing not only STR complaints but other important by-law issues such as property standard complaints.

With the announcement of the retirement of current CAO Shelley Chemnitz, Council embarked on a recruitment process to select a new CAO, ultimately selecting Oakes to fill the role. Chemnitz leaves the position after over 30 years with the municipality. “Having worked with David for many years, he has the vision and leadership to lead St. Catharines forward. This past year alone, he has gone above and beyond to meet the challenges that have been created by the global pandemic. I believe he has the necessary skills, vision and experience to be the CAO of St. Catharines,” said Chemnitz. Oakes will officially transition into the CAO position on Aug. 1, 2021, leaving his current role as Deputy CAO, a position he has filled since 2018. “Council has been very impressed with Mr. Oakes during his time as Deputy CAO,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “He has a strong track record working with many departments at the City, and he has experience working at the Region. Council was looking for someone that could lead the corporation through a period of recovery, and we believe Mr. Oakes is the ideal leader that will guide our City for years to come.” Beyond his most recent experience as Deputy CAO with the City, Oakes brings a considerable leadership track record. He first joined the City as a Community Development Officer in 2000, before serving as Director of Economic Development and Director of Parks, Recreation, and Culture Services. Oakes left the City of St. Catharines in 2016 to take on the role of Director of Economic Development for the Niagara Region, before returning to the City as Deputy CAO in 2018. “I am so proud of the work we’ve done to build a liveable, dynamic City over recent years. We’ve maintained the trust the public places in us as public servants to provide critical services and infrastructure. I’m excited to continue that in this new role, Shelley will be missed, and I hope to build on her experience and work as we drive prosperity, compassion, environmental stewardship and cultural growth in our community,” said Oakes.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Vaccine delivery in Niagara is being overseen by Niagara Region Public Health. For information on vaccine delivery, eligibility, booking and more please visit Public Health's vaccine page.

While the Niagara Region have upper-tier DCs in place, St. Catharines is currently the only municipality in Niagara that does not have lower-tier DCs. The Province’s Development Charges Act sets out the mandatory process of calculating development charges, and, as a result, the City has undertaken the Development Charges Background Study. This study includes background information on the infrastructure per capita provided over the past 10 years and determines the potential revenue that the City may generate with DCs as well as the recommended DCs amounts that the City should charge. It also includes exemptions and policies on the application of the charges. The City’s total capital projects benefitting growth over the next 21 years are estimated to cost $200 million, and include everything from additional water services to expansions of parks and recreations services and facilities, additional buses, library expansion, additional public works equipment, expansion of active transportation and more. Of the estimated total, about $59 million would be eligible to be funded through development charges.

The crosswalk was installed last week at the St. Paul Street pedestrian crossover located in front of the FirstOntario PAC, with a design developed in consultation with the City’s LGBTQ2+ and Anti-racism Advisory Committees. The design is a modified version of the Human Rights and Equity Pride Flag. That design builds on the familiar rainbow Pride Flag with the addition of black and brown stripes to represent queer and trans black, indigenous and people of colour folks. Additionally, blue and pink stripes to represent the trans community. The modified design also features a purple chevron, intersecting with white, recognizing the traditional lands of the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe, and the Two Row Wampum agreement. Mayor Walter Sendzik joined LGBTQ2+ Advisory Committee Chair Liam Clarke-Coward to celebrate the opening on Wednesday, reaffirming the City’s commitment to creating an inclusive community that celebrates the diversity of all its members while delivering a high quality of life regardless of sexual orientation, gender, or background. “The City of St. Catharines has made a commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity and this new crosswalk is a very visible symbol and reminder of that commitment. Thank you to the LGBTQ2+ Advisory committee for their work on the design and implementation of the Pride Crosswalk,” said Sendzik. “This design is a visible acknowledgement of the city’s solidarity with our LGBTQ2+ and BIPOC communities here in St. Catharines and to visitors from afar. We want to ensure our community is a place where everyone feels seen and welcomed.” The crosswalk’s installation adds to ongoing work to foster social well being, inclusivity and diversity in the city, including the signing of the Leadership Accord on Gender Diversity; and the creation of the LGBTQ2+ and Anti-racism Advisory Committees, ensuring the voices of historically marginalized equity-seeking groups are heard in the decision making process. “We want equity-seeking groups to know they are heard, they are seen and they are valued as important members of our community, the crosswalk is a way to visibly represent that every day in a very noticeable way,” said Deputy CAO David Oakes, adding, “St. Catharines is a community that not only recognizes, but embraces inclusivity. Diverse voices and viewpoints do nothing but strengthen us and foster mutual understanding.” The crosswalk was installed using pre-formed thermoplastic material; a heavy-duty, durable, intersection-grade product which is applied with an adhesive to the asphalt and then heated using a propane torch essentially melting it into the road surface. The method creates a much more durable surface, lasting six to eight times longer than traditional traffic paint.

Earlier this year City Council had approved temporary free parking in response to the provincial restrictions in an effort to support businesses that continued to operate during the shutdown. With reopening set to take place later this month, paid parking will return on June 2. “As businesses reopen under the phased provincial framework, drawing both visitors and employees downtown, demand for parking, most notably convenient on-street meter spaces, will continue to increase,” said Lisa Read, manager of revenue. “As we prepare for demand to increase, bringing regular parking operations and enforcement back online is critical in ensuring there are spaces for those who need them as we work to rebuild our local economy in the wake of COVID-19.” Free curbside parking will continue at designated spaces downtown, in Port Dalhousie and on Facer Street, offering 15-minute parking for individuals who are accessing local businesses for pickup and takeout. Those wishing to utilize the paid parking are also reminded that they can use Honk Mobile app for contactless payment at parking lots and on-street spaces. The app is available via the Google Play and Apple App Store. For more information, visit www.honkmobile.com. Monthly permit holders for garages already received notification that automatic payments would resume on May 31 as part of the return of paid parking. Beach Parking begins June 2 June 2 also marks the start of paid parking at St. Catharines beaches as part of the beach strategy approved by City Council. Access to beaches remains free for all visitors, but parking enforcement and fines will be stepped up in nearby special provision areas, alongside the introduction of $3-per-hour paid parking at beach lots and the meters on Lakeport Road in Port Dalhousie with a non-extendible three-hour time limit, between June 2 and Sept. 30. Offsite long-term parking will be provided free of charge, with connections to beaches via the City’s active transportation network. St. Catharines residents can still apply for a Resident Beach Parking Pass, allowing for free parking with no time limit at the Sunset Beach and Lakeside Park lots. Passes are available to St. Catharines residents only and can be registered to up to two licence plates, but are limited to one per household. Passes do not guarantee a parking spot. Details can be found online at www.stcatharines.ca/beaches. The City is currently processing requests and mailing out passes. Due to the volume of passes, we are asking for the patience of community members. In the interim, residents attending the beach without a pass will be provided with a temporary beach pass (with proof of residency) that will be valid until June 13. After June 14, resident parking beach passes will be required to park at both beach lots, or vehicles will be subjected to the hourly cost and time restrictions.

With the announcement of the retirement of current CAO Shelley Chemnitz, Council embarked on a recruitment process to select a new CAO, ultimately selecting Oakes to fill the role. Chemnitz leaves the position after over 30 years with the municipality. “Having worked with David for many years, he has the vision and leadership to lead St. Catharines forward. This past year alone, he has gone above and beyond to meet the challenges that have been created by the global pandemic. I believe he has the necessary skills, vision and experience to be the CAO of St. Catharines,” said Chemnitz. Oakes will officially transition into the CAO position on Aug. 1, 2021, leaving his current role as Deputy CAO, a position he has filled since 2018. “Council has been very impressed with Mr. Oakes during his time as Deputy CAO,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “He has a strong track record working with many departments at the City, and he has experience working at the Region. Council was looking for someone that could lead the corporation through a period of recovery, and we believe Mr. Oakes is the ideal leader that will guide our City for years to come.” Beyond his most recent experience as Deputy CAO with the City, Oakes brings a considerable leadership track record. He first joined the City as a Community Development Officer in 2000, before serving as Director of Economic Development and Director of Parks, Recreation, and Culture Services. Oakes left the City of St. Catharines in 2016 to take on the role of Director of Economic Development for the Niagara Region, before returning to the City as Deputy CAO in 2018. “I am so proud of the work we’ve done to build a liveable, dynamic City over recent years. We’ve maintained the trust the public places in us as public servants to provide critical services and infrastructure. I’m excited to continue that in this new role, Shelley will be missed, and I hope to build on her experience and work as we drive prosperity, compassion, environmental stewardship and cultural growth in our community,” said Oakes.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

While the Niagara Region have upper-tier DCs in place, St. Catharines is currently the only municipality in Niagara that does not have lower-tier DCs. The Province’s Development Charges Act sets out the mandatory process of calculating development charges, and, as a result, the City has undertaken the Development Charges Background Study. This study includes background information on the infrastructure per capita provided over the past 10 years and determines the potential revenue that the City may generate with DCs as well as the recommended DCs amounts that the City should charge. It also includes exemptions and policies on the application of the charges. The City’s total capital projects benefitting growth over the next 21 years are estimated to cost $200 million, and include everything from additional water services to expansions of parks and recreations services and facilities, additional buses, library expansion, additional public works equipment, expansion of active transportation and more. Of the estimated total, about $59 million would be eligible to be funded through development charges. A video presentation of the Development Charges Background Study along with the complete study and a public feedback survey can now be found at www.EngageSTC.ca/DevelopmentCharges. Public feedback will be compiled for Council prior to a public meeting to be held on July 12.

The crosswalk was installed last week at the St. Paul Street pedestrian crossover located in front of the FirstOntario PAC, with a design developed in consultation with the City’s LGBTQ2+ and Anti-racism Advisory Committees. The design is a modified version of the Human Rights and Equity Pride Flag. That design builds on the familiar rainbow Pride Flag with the addition of black and brown stripes to represent queer and trans black, indigenous and people of colour folks. Additionally, blue and pink stripes to represent the trans community. The modified design also features a purple chevron, intersecting with white, recognizing the traditional lands of the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe, and the Two Row Wampum agreement. Mayor Walter Sendzik joined LGBTQ2+ Advisory Committee Chair Liam Clarke-Coward to celebrate the opening on Wednesday, reaffirming the City’s commitment to creating an inclusive community that celebrates the diversity of all its members while delivering a high quality of life regardless of sexual orientation, gender, or background. “The City of St. Catharines has made a commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity and this new crosswalk is a very visible symbol and reminder of that commitment. Thank you to the LGBTQ2+ Advisory committee for their work on the design and implementation of the Pride Crosswalk,” said Sendzik. “This design is a visible acknowledgement of the city’s solidarity with our LGBTQ2+ and BIPOC communities here in St. Catharines and to visitors from afar. We want to ensure our community is a place where everyone feels seen and welcomed.” The crosswalk’s installation adds to ongoing work to foster social well being, inclusivity and diversity in the city, including the signing of the Leadership Accord on Gender Diversity; and the creation of the LGBTQ2+ and Anti-racism Advisory Committees, ensuring the voices of historically marginalized equity-seeking groups are heard in the decision making process. “We want equity-seeking groups to know they are heard, they are seen and they are valued as important members of our community, the crosswalk is a way to visibly represent that every day in a very noticeable way,” said Deputy CAO David Oakes, adding, “St. Catharines is a community that not only recognizes, but embraces inclusivity. Diverse voices and viewpoints do nothing but strengthen us and foster mutual understanding.” The crosswalk was installed using pre-formed thermoplastic material; a heavy-duty, durable, intersection-grade product which is applied with an adhesive to the asphalt and then heated using a propane torch essentially melting it into the road surface. The method creates a much more durable surface, lasting six to eight times longer than traditional traffic paint.

In an effort to support business recovery City Council has approved the waiving of business licensing and sidewalk patio fees in 2022 for businesses in certain sectors most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The move continues efforts that saw fees waived in 2020 and 2021. Business licensing fees will be waived for: Amusement arcades Auctioneers Hawkers / peddlers such as food trucks Public halls Refreshment stands Restaurants Theatres In addition, businesses operating sidewalk patios will not have to pay City fees typically associated with such operations. “The entertainment and hospitality industries have been extremely hard hit by the pandemic, but it is these businesses that are so crucial not only as employers, but as key players in establishing our City as a destination and breathing new life into our streets,” said Director of Economic Development and Tourism Services (EDTS) Brian York. “As a City we remain committed to supporting them in whatever ways we can, including eliminating some of the costs associated with them doing business during the recovery period.” The continued waiving of fees comes alongside other efforts to support local business. Expanded temporary outdoor patio permissions are being granted again in 2021 to allow eateries to safely reopen with larger operational footprints serving more visitors; and weekend downtown road closures return this weekend to provide for further patio space and attract visitors to the City core. The City is not stopping with short-term supports for businesses. Looking to long-term recovery, EDTS has outlined a roadmap to support business while shoring up future economic resiliency in its Pandemic Recovery Strategy.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

This week the centre launched Social Media: The Business Edit, a four-part online series providing guides, tutorials and the opportunity for questions and tailored advice, all aimed at assisting entrepreneurs in improving the social media presence of their business. The St. Catharines Enterprise Centre (SCEC) has teamed up with 47 other small business centres in Ontario to form the Covid-19 Recovery Network, developing the new training series as part of its COVID-19 recovery support efforts. “A robust online presence has become increasingly important for businesses to succeed, especially in the post-pandemic context. Buyer habits are trending towards an increase in online purchases so it is crucial for businesses to inhabit an online retail space,” said SCEC small business consultant Rob Belchior, adding, “social media is obviously a part of everyday life for many of us, so supporting our business community in reaching audiences and customers online, where they are is critical.” A recent survey of Niagara businesses conducted by Niagara’s Rapid Economic Response Team placed increased online presence as the second highest priority for businesses in Niagara. With the SCEC continuing an array of efforts to support local business through pandemic recovery, and the importance of online presence for business, the centre is taking a greater focus on supporting entrepreneurs in driving business online. Social Media: The Business Edit, kicks off on July 8, running weekly until July 29. Participants will be able to access the series’ guides and tutorials, while having the ability to ask question of experts and receive advice. Course materials will be posted weekly in the new St. Catharines Small Business Support Network Facebook group. Interested parties can register via the SCEC website at investinSTC.ca/SmallBusiness. Those who miss the first instalment can still register for later portions of the series. Tutorials include: The Building Blocks of Social Media and Business; An In-depth Look at Content Creation; Social Media and Advertising; and The Social Media Storefront. Beyond the series the SCEC is continuing to assist local small businesses in establishing themselves and navigating pandemic recovery. The SCEC offers a wide range of resources and webinars for small businesses as well as one on one consultations. About the St. Catharines Enterprise Centre: The St. Catharines Enterprise Centre is one of 47 small business enterprise centres which serve as a resource to Ontario’s small businesses and startups. The small business enterprise centres have adapted their services to form the Ontario Small Business COVID-19 Recovery Network. The network serves to support small businesses as they launch, grow or adapt.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments While City Hall remains closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City.

Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

This week the centre launched Social Media: The Business Edit, a four-part online series providing guides, tutorials and the opportunity for questions and tailored advice, all aimed at assisting entrepreneurs in improving the social media presence of their business. The St. Catharines Enterprise Centre (SCEC) has teamed up with 47 other small business centres in Ontario to form the Covid-19 Recovery Network, developing the new training series as part of its COVID-19 recovery support efforts. “A robust online presence has become increasingly important for businesses to succeed, especially in the post-pandemic context. Buyer habits are trending towards an increase in online purchases so it is crucial for businesses to inhabit an online retail space,” said SCEC small business consultant Rob Belchior, adding, “social media is obviously a part of everyday life for many of us, so supporting our business community in reaching audiences and customers online, where they are is critical.” A recent survey of Niagara businesses conducted by Niagara’s Rapid Economic Response Team placed increased online presence as the second highest priority for businesses in Niagara. With the SCEC continuing an array of efforts to support local business through pandemic recovery, and the importance of online presence for business, the centre is taking a greater focus on supporting entrepreneurs in driving business online. Social Media: The Business Edit, kicks off on July 8, running weekly until July 29. Participants will be able to access the series’ guides and tutorials, while having the ability to ask question of experts and receive advice. Course materials will be posted weekly in the new St. Catharines Small Business Support Network Facebook group. Interested parties can register via the SCEC website at investinSTC.ca/SmallBusiness. Those who miss the first instalment can still register for later portions of the series. Tutorials include: The Building Blocks of Social Media and Business; An In-depth Look at Content Creation; Social Media and Advertising; and The Social Media Storefront. Beyond the series the SCEC is continuing to assist local small businesses in establishing themselves and navigating pandemic recovery. The SCEC offers a wide range of resources and webinars for small businesses as well as one on one consultations. About the St. Catharines Enterprise Centre: The St. Catharines Enterprise Centre is one of 47 small business enterprise centres which serve as a resource to Ontario’s small businesses and startups. The small business enterprise centres have adapted their services to form the Ontario Small Business COVID-19 Recovery Network. The network serves to support small businesses as they launch, grow or adapt.

North is Freedom: The Legacy of the Underground Railroad will open on Sunday, Aug. 1, helping mark Emancipation Day in Canada. The exhibit, a photographic essay by Canadian photographer Yuri Dojc, celebrates the descendants of freedom seekers who escaped slavery in the United States in the years before the American Civil War. The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre has partnered with the Central Ontario Network for Black History (CONBH) to bring this exhibit to the local community until July 15, 2022. The Museum has been a member of CONBH since its inception and a proud supporter of their projects. About 30,000 men, women and children fled north to freedom, settling from the Canadian Maritimes to as far west as the Manitoba border. Some arrived alone, while others found their way to Canada with the help of a clandestine network of “conductors” and “stations”, known as the Underground Railroad. Many came to what is now Ontario, to places such as Windsor, Chatham, Buxton, the Niagara Peninsula — including the City of St. Catharines, — Owen Sound, and larger cities like Hamilton and Toronto. Some 150 years later, Dojc’s work features 24 images celebrating the history of descendants and their ancestors’ courage. Black and white, young and old, those highlighted are the descendants of once-enslaved Africans who have contributed to the growth of this nation. “The story of the Underground Railroad and of freedom seekers is an integral part of our community’s story and the descendants of these brave individuals have helped shape our city in so many important ways,” said Kathleen Powell, the City’s supervisor of historical services. “We are so pleased to partner with the Central Ontario Network for Black History to host this compelling and thought-provoking exhibit featuring amazing stories of courage and perseverance.” A virtual opening for the exhibit is being scheduled for Sunday, Aug. 1, as part of the Museum’s 2021 Emancipation Day celebrations. The virtual opening will be streamed via YouTube at 2 p.m., and will also be available to replay afterwards, on the Museum’s YouTube page. Details can be found at www.stcatharines.ca/northisfreedomopening. Once open, the exhibit will be available for viewing to all visitors to the Museum during operating hours. The St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre is open to the public seven days a week, with some adjusted hours due to COVID-19. Admission to the Museum is by donation. Please check out the Museum’s website, at www.stcatharinesmuseum.ca, for more information about the exhibit, operating hours and COVID-19 protocols.

Emergency Orders Enforcement Currently under provincial orders certain non-essential businesses are required to remain closed while others must operate under certain safety protocols. Residents who are concerned with individuals or groups violating Provincial emergency orders can report them: During business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday: via our online form for investigation, via phone at 905.688.5600 or via email at CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments When City Hall is closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City.

Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

With COVID-19 restrictions slowly lifting recreation and leisure teams from the City of St. Catharines, Fort Erie, Port Colborne, Niagara Falls, Welland, Pelham, West Lincoln, Lincoln, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Thorold, Grimsby and the Niagara Parks Commission are joining together to host Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara from noon, Aug. 27 to midnight, Sept. 6. The online scavenger hunt, hosted on the GooseChase app, invites Niagara residents from across the region to reconnect with their neighbouring municipalities and rediscover the rich natural landscapes and history they offer. Using the app participants will be invited to snap photos or videos as they explore locations and attractions across Niagara to complete missions, each mission completed will net points, with participants able to track their progress against others. “It adds a bit of fun, friendly competition while inviting residents to get out and enjoy all Niagara has to offer. We’ve all been trying to stay home as much as possible, but as restrictions slowly lift, we want our residents to reconnect with their neighbouring communities and truly enjoy all of Niagara,” said St. Catharines community and events coordinator Andrea Connelly-Miele. The missions are designed in such a way to provide participants with a wholistic glimpse of Niagara, its history and its natural beauty. More than 20 missions are planned, including exploring the Friendship Trail in Port Colborne; checking out an armored vehicle at the Lake Street Armoury in St. Catharines; Niagara Parks Power Station trivia; and more. Prizes will be awarded to the most creative family or team entry and to point leaders. First-, second- and third-place packages for point leaders include gift cards to local businesses and Niagara-themed merchandise packages from the Niagara Parks Commission. The most creative family or team will pick up a one-night stay at Great Wolf Lodge, including waterpark access, alongside a Niagara Parks Commission family prize pack. To enter download the free GooseChase app via the Apple Apps Store or Google Play Store and search for the game code XD4MKQ to find Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara. Further details can be found via the Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara Facebook event page.

Specifically, the City is looking to the public to provide input, via an online survey, to help identify their preferences when it comes to recreation programming, but also to provide new ideas for novel recreation programs. It is an opportunity for facility users to ensure their interests and passions are reflected in recreation programming; in addition to providing potential instructors the ability to pitch a possible course they could lead. “The impacts of the pandemic on our programming have been extensive. We want to take those impacts and use them to create something positive. As we emerge from the pandemic, we have this unique opportunity to examine our programming and find new ways to entertain and educate our residents, creating a recreation landscape that serves a wider range of interests and needs,” said Lori Mambella, manager, Programs and Culture Services. Members of the public can visit engageSTC.ca/RecIdeas and complete a short survey to provide their input. The survey allows residents to select specific programming areas they are interested in seeing expanded, alongside the ability to provide open-ended ideas and feedback, including offering their services as a potential instructor.

With COVID-19 restrictions slowly lifting recreation and leisure teams from the City of St. Catharines, Fort Erie, Port Colborne, Niagara Falls, Welland, Pelham, West Lincoln, Lincoln, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Thorold, Grimsby and the Niagara Parks Commission are joining together to host Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara from noon, Aug. 27 to midnight, Sept. 6. The online scavenger hunt, hosted on the GooseChase app, invites Niagara residents from across the region to reconnect with their neighbouring municipalities and rediscover the rich natural landscapes and history they offer. Using the app participants will be invited to snap photos or videos as they explore locations and attractions across Niagara to complete missions, each mission completed will net points, with participants able to track their progress against others. “It adds a bit of fun, friendly competition while inviting residents to get out and enjoy all Niagara has to offer. We’ve all been trying to stay home as much as possible, but as restrictions slowly lift, we want our residents to reconnect with their neighbouring communities and truly enjoy all of Niagara,” said St. Catharines community and events coordinator Andrea Connelly-Miele. The missions are designed in such a way to provide participants with a wholistic glimpse of Niagara, its history and its natural beauty. More than 20 missions are planned, including exploring the Friendship Trail in Port Colborne; checking out an armored vehicle at the Lake Street Armoury in St. Catharines; Niagara Parks Power Station trivia; and more. Prizes will be awarded to the most creative family or team entry and to point leaders. First-, second- and third-place packages for point leaders include gift cards to local businesses and Niagara-themed merchandise packages from the Niagara Parks Commission. The most creative family or team will pick up a one-night stay at Great Wolf Lodge, including waterpark access, alongside a Niagara Parks Commission family prize pack. To enter download the free GooseChase app via the Apple Apps Store or Google Play Store and search for the game code XD4MKQ to find Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara. Further details can be found via the Reconnect to Rediscover Niagara Facebook event page.

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments When City Hall is closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens. Further information Knowledge of COVID-19, including ways to limit transmission, is important for all residents as the City works to limit the spread of the virus. What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new (novel) coronavirus is a new virus in this family which we have not previously seen. Symptoms include: Fever / chills Cough Runny nose or stuff / congestion, not related to allergies Difficulty breathing Decrease or loss of taste or smell Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Fatigue, extreme tiredness or muscle aches How can you limit the spread There are simple measures every resident can take to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community, including: Washing hands often with soap and water Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if hand washing is not possible Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Social distancing: stay home and only leave for food and other essentials, preferably only once per week Covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with a tissue or arms and sleeves Avoid touching of the face, eyes, mouth and eyes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces Staying home if sick Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities Avoiding sharing of personal items Wear a mask when physical distancing is difficult or not an option Vaccinations Getting a vaccine when available is critical in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

After extensive public engagement with the community and stakeholders – including the development industry and the City’s Development Studies Task Force, Council approved a development charges background study and bylaw Monday night, paving the way for development charge bylaw to come into effect January 1, 2022. Development charges are fees imposed on land development and redevelopment projects to help pay for the cost of infrastructure required to provide municipal services to new development, such as roads; transit; water and sewer infrastructure; fire services infrastructure; and park amenities and community centres. St. Catharines is currently the only municipality in Niagara that does not collect lower-tier development charges. For 12 years, this put the City at a competitive advantage and encouraged growth and interest in the community. However, most growth-related infrastructure built in that time was primarily funded from the tax levy and/or water/wastewater rates. While the revenue will depend on development levels, a consultant hired to conduct the study has indicated the City could potentially collect millions of dollars in development charges on an annual basis to support infrastructure costs related to development and redevelopment. “Years ago, the City of St. Catharines made a smart decision to attract investment and redevelopment and now, the time has come for Council to make another smart decision that better reflects the current state of investment attraction in St. Catharines,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “This is a fair, balanced approached that will ensure that the costs of new development do not fall to the taxpayer and that growth will pay for growth in the future. Development charges will better position the City to invest in infrastructure and public realm improvements that benefit everyone.” The charges – which will be applied to both residential and non-residential projects - will be city wide, allowing for more efficient use of funds and ensuring all growth that may benefit from the service has contributed towards it. The City’s charges, once they come into effect, will be lower than many municipal comparators and opportunities will exist for exemptions and grant programs to support projects such as affordable housing, employment creation and development in the urban core. The recently approved bylaw includes a transition period for developers with projects that are already underway. The charges themselves will be collectable beginning January 2022. “Reinstating development charges is part of the City’s commitment towards better fiscal responsibility, stability and sustainability,” said Tami Kitay, the City’s Director of Planning and Building Services. “This transformational shift corrects an unbalance whereby growth will pay for their fair share of growth and will assist with capital budget forecasting and financing, strategic decision making, and investment back into the community.” Back to Search Copyright © 2014 The Corporation of the City of St. Catharines AccessibilityCareersCommentsContactsDisclaimersRequirementsSite Map PO Box 3012, 50 Church St., St. Catharines, ON L2R 7C2 City Hall Hours: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Phone & Email Service: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. TTY: 905.688.4TTY(4889) Tel : 905.688.5600 | Fax: 905.688.4077 Email: CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca Designed by eSolutionsGroup"

State of Emergency On Jan. 12, 2021, the Province of Ontario, declared a State of Emergency. What is a declaration of emergency? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act the Premier, or their designate, has the authority to declare an emergency in response to a situation, or impending situation, that presents a major danger that could result in serious harm to residents or substantial damage to property. Why did the Province declare an emergency? The declaration underscores the continued importance of efforts to flatten the transmission curve, reminding residents that even as faith-based holidays approach and the weather improves they must continue to do their part by following the advice of public health officials, and orders put in place by the Province, to: Self isolate and stay home whenever possible Maintain physical separation of two metres Limit contact to their own household Wash their hands regularly Routinely disinfect surfaces Observe mandatory closures of non-essential businesses and outdoor recreational amenities Follow mandatory 14-day quarantines when returning from travel outside of the province Declaring an emergency allows us to not only draw attention to how important public cooperation is and how serious the COVID-19 situation could become, but also allows the City to act more quickly in its decision making in response to the virus. Are we more at risk now that an emergency has been declared? No, the declaration does not mean the risk is greater, it does however recognize with the beginning of community spread and the efforts on behalf of the City, residents and businesses to reduce the spread are more important than ever. This potential for increased spread in the community meets the criteria of potential immediate risk to declare an emergency. Does this impact how the City will deliver services? At this time the City facilities are closed to the public. However we will continue to offer essential services to residents. Currently there is no impact on these core services. The declaration means, should things rapidly escalate or change, the City will be able to move swiftly to ensure services such as water and transportation are not interrupted. See our Contact page for more information. What does this mean to me? It means residents must continue to do their part in limiting the spread of the virus, following the suggestions of public health, and orders from the Province of Ontario. Those found violating Provincial orders could face fines. Payments When City Hall is closed to the public, residents have several payment options for property tax, water bills and parking tickets that can be done from the comfort and safety of their own home. Water and tax payments can be made via online banking through a resident’s financial provider. Cheques can also be mailed to the City. Details on these methods of payment are available at www.stcatharines.ca/paymentoptions. All payments can also be made via cheque at the City Hall drop box, located at the James Street entrance. Do not deposit cash via the drop box. The City also offers pre-authorized payment for water / wastewater and property taxes. Preauthorized debit agreements are available online at www.stcatharines.ca/preauthorizedpayment. Taxpayers can use the City’s online e-bill portal to access water and tax information. A link to the portal, and information on how to register, is available at www.stcatharines.ca/ebilling. Residents who have purchased or sold a property can use our online form to ensure their information is up to date and to notify the City of a new water account or account closure. COVID-19 Property Tax Payment Plan Council has approved the creation of a Special Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan for 2021 which would allow all tax payers whose taxes were paid in full by Feb. 28, 2020 — and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic — to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest free over a 12 month period. Applications must be received by Jan. 29, 2021. For more information visit the 2021 Pre-authorized Property Taxes COVID-19 Payment Plan Page. Business Licences New Business Licences will still be processed if accompanied with a cheque via the James Street drop box at City Hall, and issued once the facility reopens. Business Licence renewals can be processed if submitted via the James Street drop box with a cheque, and issued once City Hall reopens.

After extensive public engagement with the community and stakeholders – including the development industry and the City’s Development Studies Task Force, Council approved a development charges background study and bylaw Monday night, paving the way for development charge bylaw to come into effect January 1, 2022. Development charges are fees imposed on land development and redevelopment projects to help pay for the cost of infrastructure required to provide municipal services to new development, such as roads; transit; water and sewer infrastructure; fire services infrastructure; and park amenities and community centres. St. Catharines is currently the only municipality in Niagara that does not collect lower-tier development charges. For 12 years, this put the City at a competitive advantage and encouraged growth and interest in the community. However, most growth-related infrastructure built in that time was primarily funded from the tax levy and/or water/wastewater rates. While the revenue will depend on development levels, a consultant hired to conduct the study has indicated the City could potentially collect millions of dollars in development charges on an annual basis to support infrastructure costs related to development and redevelopment. “Years ago, the City of St. Catharines made a smart decision to attract investment and redevelopment and now, the time has come for Council to make another smart decision that better reflects the current state of investment attraction in St. Catharines,” said Mayor Walter Sendzik. “This is a fair, balanced approached that will ensure that the costs of new development do not fall to the taxpayer and that growth will pay for growth in the future. Development charges will better position the City to invest in infrastructure and public realm improvements that benefit everyone.” The charges – which will be applied to both residential and non-residential projects - will be city wide, allowing for more efficient use of funds and ensuring all growth that may benefit from the service has contributed towards it. The City’s charges, once they come into effect, will be lower than many municipal comparators and opportunities will exist for exemptions and grant programs to support projects such as affordable housing, employment creation and development in the urban core. The recently approved bylaw includes a transition period for developers with projects that are already underway. The charges themselves will be collectable beginning January 2022. “Reinstating development charges is part of the City’s commitment towards better fiscal responsibility, stability and sustainability,” said Tami Kitay, the City’s Director of Planning and Building Services. “This transformational shift corrects an unbalance whereby growth will pay for their fair share of growth and will assist with capital budget forecasting and financing, strategic decision making, and investment back into the community.” Back to Search Copyright © 2014 The Corporation of the City of St. Catharines AccessibilityCareersCommentsContactsDisclaimersRequirementsSite Map PO Box 3012, 50 Church St., St. Catharines, ON L2R 7C2 City Hall Hours: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Phone & Email Service: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. TTY: 905.688.4TTY(4889) Tel : 905.688.5600 | Fax: 905.688.4077 Email: CitizensFirst@stcatharines.ca Designed by eSolutionsGroup"

Specifically, all City employees — with the exception of those unable to receive the vaccine due to a Human Rights Code exemption — will be required to be fully vaccinated. With scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccines in curbing the spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of the Delta Variant to unvaccinated individuals, the City is adding vaccine requirements to its existing COVID-19 employee safety protocols such as mask requirements, daily screening and increased disinfection efforts. “As a public-sector employer we need to lead by example and that includes doing everything we can to protect both our employees and the public from the risks of COVID-19, our employees are the most critical asset we have and we are doing everything we can to keep them safe and healthy so they can continue to deliver the services our residents rely on,” said CAO David Oakes, adding, “vaccines are critical in protecting our employees health and safety, but they are also another tool moving us forward out of the pandemic.” The City is instituting the policy with a phased-in approach, providing employees who have not yet been vaccinated adequate time to receive a two-dose vaccine regimen. The employee vaccination policy applies to all City employees, students working in the organization and volunteers, with the exception of volunteer members of boards, commissions or advisory committees.
