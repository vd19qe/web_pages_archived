Out of an abundance of caution for our clients, we are temporarily suspending our Saturday take out lunches. This decision was made because of the City of Welland State of Emergency declaration and because we want to ensure that there is no crowding or congregating to prevent the spread of COVID 19, especially in the vulnerable population that we serve. OUR FOOD BANK IS STILL OPEN Tuesday to Friday mornings from 9am-12pm. We are distributing groceries to people in need, including many options that do not require cooking facilities. This measure is temporary and we look forward to starting Saturday lunches again very soon.

Thanks to a grant provided by Niagara Prosperity Initiative through the Niagara Region, we have been able to expand our hours to the afternoon, reduce barriers and provide more people with access to healthy food. There have been many people who have taken advantage of the afternoon hours already.

Latest News Words of Comfort Posted Aug 12th, 2020 Thanks to a generous donation from the Canadian Bible Society, we were able to offer Bibles, devotionals and “Words of Comfort” booklets (written specifically to give hope during COVID) to everyone who came to our food bank for food. Over the course of June and July we distributed 152 Bibles, 64 Youth Bibles, 184 Words of Comfort booklets, and 175 Inspire Justice devotionals. These materials were so appreciated by the people who received them, including “Sarah.” Sarah, a single mom with four children who came to our food bank and received bags of food, a Bible and devotional, couldn’t say enough about how receiving the Bible from CBS impacted her and her children’s lives. She said she loved how the special highlighting in the Bible allows her to see God's love specifically to those who are suffering. She also loves the devotional. She said the way the devotionals are written encompasses God's character in such a beautiful way. Sarah said, “It is hard to understand and to put into words the unconditional love of the Lord but this devotional has been an amazing tool to learn more about God.” Her four kids also received the Bible and the devotional books. They too love reading and learning from the books. Sarah also said, “The way they explain God’s word is simplified so that you can remember it and share it with others. It truly speaks to the heart. The explanation is very strong and the words are very refreshing. The examples they give are very strong. I am able to understand it right away.” Thank you Canadian Bible Society for equipping us to reach out to people like Sarah with words of hope and comfort from God’s Word during this challenging time. We are very grateful for your partnership. Read more Coming full circle Posted Aug 4th, 2020 ""My grandma didn't want to ask for help. She was like, 'Getting help? Yikes!'
