21055,20200515,tripadvisor.mediaroom.com,https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/caen-content-integrity-policy,text/html,text/html,en,"CA EN Press Center | Resources Go back to Tripadvisor Media Centre About Tripadvisor Investor Relations Resources Contact Us Newsroom Press Releases In the News Logo & Guidelines Content Integrity Policy Our Approach to Content Integrity At Tripadvisor, we've created a community where members can read one another's travel reviews and plan and book their perfect trips. Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted.

56557,20200522,tripadvisor.mediaroom.com,https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/caen-content-integrity-policy,text/html,text/html,en,"CA EN Press Center | Resources Go back to Tripadvisor Media Centre About Tripadvisor Investor Relations Resources Contact Us Newsroom Press Releases In the News Logo & Guidelines Content Integrity Policy Our Approach to Content Integrity At Tripadvisor, we've created a community where members can read one another's travel reviews and plan and book their perfect trips. Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use.

The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme.

When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.

In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items (""Interactive Areas""). If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area. To the extent that any entity that is one of the Tripadvisor Companies provides any form of private communication channel between Account Holders, you agree that such entity(ies) may monitor the substance of such communications in order to help safeguard our community and the Services. You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging. In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites. The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections. By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor’s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor. You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that: Is false, unlawful, misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing (or advocates harassment of another person), threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable; Is patently offensive to the online community, such as that which promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; Would constitute, encourage, promote or provide instructions for conduct of an illegal activity, a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate the rights of any party in any country of the world, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, national or international law, including, without limitation, the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any rules of any securities exchange, including but not limited to, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange; Provides instructional information about illegal activities such as making or buying illegal weapons, violating someone’s privacy or providing or creating computer viruses; May infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.

When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items (""Interactive Areas""). If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging. In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites.

Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections. By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor’s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor. You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that: Is false, unlawful, misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing (or advocates harassment of another person), threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable; Is patently offensive to the online community, such as that which promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; Would constitute, encourage, promote or provide instructions for conduct of an illegal activity, a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate the rights of any party in any country of the world, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, national or international law, including, without limitation, the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any rules of any securities exchange, including but not limited to, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange; Provides instructional information about illegal activities such as making or buying illegal weapons, violating someone’s privacy or providing or creating computer viruses; May infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Information Retention We will retain copies of your information for as long as you maintain your account or as necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Statement, unless applicable law requires a longer retention period. In addition, we may retain your information for the duration of any period necessary to establish, exercise or defend any legal rights. Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted. Our use of any information we collect through cookies is subject to this Statement, which is linked on every page of our website. Statement Changes and Notification We may update this Statement in the future. If we believe any changes are material, we will let you know by doing one or more of the following: sending you a communication about the changes, placing a notice on the website and/or posting an updated Statement on the website.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted. Our use of any information we collect through cookies is subject to this Statement, which is linked on every page of our website.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content.

The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features.

Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items (""Interactive Areas"").

The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging.

Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov. BY LISTING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS. LIABILITY DISCLAIMER PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION LIMITS THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies?

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors.

We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences.

This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.

Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted. Our use of any information we collect through cookies is subject to this Statement, which is linked on every page of our website. Statement Changes and Notification We may update this Statement in the future. If we believe any changes are material, we will let you know by doing one or more of the following: sending you a communication about the changes, placing a notice on the website and/or posting an updated Statement on the website.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.

In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items (""Interactive Areas""). If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area. To the extent that any entity that is one of the Tripadvisor Companies provides any form of private communication channel between Account Holders, you agree that such entity(ies) may monitor the substance of such communications in order to help safeguard our community and the Services. You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging. In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites. The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections. By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor’s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor. You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that: Is false, unlawful, misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing (or advocates harassment of another person), threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable; Is patently offensive to the online community, such as that which promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; Would constitute, encourage, promote or provide instructions for conduct of an illegal activity, a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate the rights of any party in any country of the world, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, national or international law, including, without limitation, the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any rules of any securities exchange, including but not limited to, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange; Provides instructional information about illegal activities such as making or buying illegal weapons, violating someone’s privacy or providing or creating computer viruses; May infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it.

Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

If you are creating a Tripadvisor account for commercial purposes and are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a company, organisation or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorised to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in this Agreement shall refer to such entity and the individual acting on behalf of the company shall be referred to as a “Business Representative”. Through your use of the Services you may encounter links to third party sites and apps or be able to interact with third party sites and apps.

Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items (""Interactive Areas""). If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.

You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging. In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites. The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections. By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor’s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme.

You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors.

Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy.

This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the Help Center to make your objections.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.

Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner. In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ for useful information on how to do this. If you delete your cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Services might be degraded or restricted. Our use of any information we collect through cookies is subject to this Statement, which is linked on every page of our website. Statement Changes and Notification We may update this Statement in the future. If we believe any changes are material, we will let you know by doing one or more of the following: sending you a communication about the changes, placing a notice on the website and/or posting an updated Statement on the website.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

Do Not Track Signals Our website is not designed to currently respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal requests from browsers. This is due to the lack of global standardised interpretation that defines “Do Not Track” signals. Once the industry has settled on standards related to this issue, we may re-evaluate this approach. Cookies We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising. What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your Device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your internet browser and contain basic information about your internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to a website every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your Device and improve your experience by, among other things, providing you with personalised content. We also use cookies to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly when you use our Services. Other cookies help us understand your preferences. The cookies we use fall into three categories. Category Example Essential These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around the website and use all its features. Without these cookies, the website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We may also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes. You cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool, as such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the features of the website. Analytics and customisation We use these cookies to help us understand how the website is being used and how we can improve your experience of it. These cookies can provide us with information to help us understand which parts of the website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how visitors reach the website. We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on the website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the website. Advertising Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select ads that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same ad from continuously reappearing for you. We also use cookies to make it easy to share content from the website with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social media sites may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on the website and allow you to share content across both the website and the social media site via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please check your social media site’s terms of use and privacy policy. We also work with third-party advertisers to give you access to travel content that might be of interest and may set cookies on our Services to provide you with advertising that matches your interests and preferences. These ""third-party cookies"" collect information about your browsing behaviour and interaction with ads or the Services more generally. This information also helps us limit the number of times you may see the same ads and improve your online experience. Cookie Consent Tool To give you control, we provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first-party and third-party cookies placed through our website and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool by clicking here or at any time through the “Cookie Consent” link at the bottom of every page or in our cookie banner.

Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe. We believe the best travel advice comes from other travelers. At Tripadvisor, our members can submit reviews of their experiences at hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Over the past 15 years, we have received more than 760 million reviews and opinions from our members, covering virtually every country in the world. We believe in ""the right to write."" The Tripadvisor community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our 490 million monthly users should feel confident sharing their opinions. When you stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community we’ve built which helps customers do just that. We believe every experience counts, not just the ones where you paid the bill. If you have a party of 12 at a restaurant, we believe that all of them should have a voice. That's what Tripadvisor stands for. Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine consumers to share their experiences. In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Tripadvisor, we don’t seek third-party verification. We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence Tripadvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking. We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment. We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized. Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors. These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Tripadvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site. How Tripadvisor identifies and blocks fraud We have more than 15 years of experience learning what normal reviews and reviewing behavior tend to look like on our platform. We're experts at spotting patterns of fraudulent activity. We capture and record thousands of data points per hour and insert them into our proprietary fraud detection processes. We run reviews through automatic filters to identify moderation or integrity issues prior to publication. This process allows Tripadvisor to analyze and categorize massive amounts of data quickly and thoroughly. We have a staff of more than 300 people all over the world working to manage content and to identify, block and remove fraud. Once reviews are published, we allow business owners and community members to flag content for our review if they believe it is fraudulent. All reports from our community and owners are reviewed and analyzed by our team of content specialists. We proactively engage with companies trying to hire people to write reviews as well as property owners attempting to buy fake reviews in order to catch those that try to circumvent our systems. How Tripadvisor penalizes businesses found to engage in fraudulent activity We block or remove the fake reviews. Each fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business’s rank in our Traveler Ranking. We may disqualify properties engaging in fraud from any special recognition, such as Travelers' Choice Awards and the Certificate of Excellence. We aggressively pursue companies that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we remove all of the fake reviews they've posted, and we penalize their clients. You may be surprised that Tripadvisor doesn’t simply remove the listing on our site for a business caught engaging in review fraud. In fact, that's exactly what some of these businesses want us to do, so they can prevent consumers from researching and commenting on them. But we believe consumers have the right to know what other Tripadvisor users are saying. Finally, we believe it's important for our community to be informed. With over 760 million reviews and opinions on Tripadvisor, and over 490 million travelers using our site each month, we're confident that we're taking the right steps to keep our content fresh and useful.

Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights.You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made ""public"" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.

In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for holiday rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals. By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.
