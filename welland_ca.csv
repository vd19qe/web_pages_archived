5391,20200417,welland.ca,https://www.welland.ca/Transit/Inter-MunicipalTransit.asp,text/html,text/html,en,"Inter-Municipal Transit Skip to Main Content Menu Listen Inter-Municipal Transit St. Catharines, Welland and Niagara Falls, along with the Niagara Region are working together to consider transit requirements for an integrated transit system. Work is underway to develop options for a joint transit system that meets the needs of all municipalities, in response to a motion from Niagara Regional Council (March, 2015) and subsequent support by the City of St. Catharines, City of Welland and City of Niagara Falls. Intermunicipal transit is a priority because: It moves people to work, school and health services It supports current GO Bus and future GO Rail Service in Niagara It facilitates economic development It contributes to a high quality of life for Niagara residents It supports sustainable development Intermunicipal transit is related to other critical transportation initiatives by the Region and City Councils, including Niagara’s Transportation Master Plan, a comprehensive strategic planning document that will define the policies, programs and infrastructure improvements needed to address Niagara's transportation needs now through to 2041, including GO Transit. Impact on Niagara GO Train Service The recent inclusion of Niagara GO service in the Provincial Government's 2016 budget indicates that GO Train service is a priority for the Province. While intermunicipal transit is not a prerequisite to GO Rail service in Niagara, an integrated system will enhance transit offerings to residents, and indicate to the Provincial Government that preparations are in place for GO and a streamlined transit system throughout Niagara's communities is a priority. Intermunicipal transit is just one initiative underway to support Niagara GO. The Niagara Transit Service Delivery and Governance Strategy Update January 2017 Since January 2016, the Inter-municipal Transit Working Group of Mayors, CAO’s and transit managers from St. Catharines, Welland and Niagara Falls with support from the Regional Chair and CAO, have been working together to develop options for integrated transit services for Niagara. The group has been working with Dillon Consulting to develop options for an integrated transit system that works for all of Niagara. Focused on the transit user, the working group has been working cooperatively make improvements to the existing Niagara Region Transit services during the pilot project period – to make the existing transit services the best they can be. A service delivery and governance strategy for the future of public transit in Niagara is being presented to local municipal councils for consideration this January and February. The Niagara Transit Service Delivery and Governance Strategy report commissioned by the Working Group provides strategic recommendations for the improvement of transit service throughout Niagara. In October 2016 Dillon Consulting provided an update to Niagara’s municipalities and sought feedback from municipal councils and the St. Catharines Transit Commission. In November the team consulted with the community at public meetings and through an online survey. The feedback from councils and the community helped shape the consultant’s final recommendations. The final report presents a governance strategy that recommends a consolidated transit model. This would see St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland Transit systems combine their services into one large consolidated transit system to serve the entire Niagara region. The consolidated transit model would allow local municipalities to maintain control over transit system planning and allows the Region to be involved in the funding and decision making of inter-municipal connections. The recommendation for consolidation calls for the creation of a new governing body such as a municipal service board or commission made up of representatives from St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Welland and Niagara Region with advisory representation from Niagara’s municipalities involved with connecting transit services. The report recommends improvements to inter-municipal transit services in Niagara by: Increasing the frequency of inter-municipal service so that buses arrive every 30 minutes during peak periods Extending service hours so that transit is available later in the evening Extending full weekend service that would have inter-municipal transit operating on Sundays. Eliminating duplicate routes and services to be –reinvested Improving integration with other municipal transit systems; Creating a new Niagara-West inter-municipal transit link Adding new dynamic transit services for low-demand and rural areas Integrating fare strategy, payment technology and trip-planning. The report also outlines the next steps to be taken to create a consolidated transit system for Niagara including financial and legal considerations to be taken by local service bodies and municipalities. The report will be presented to the city councils of St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland starting Jan. 16. It is expected that the city councils will refer the consultant’s report to municipal staff for a detailed review and report back in Feb. 2017 before any decisions are taken. The Niagara Transit Service Delivery and Governance Strategy will be presented to Niagara Regional Council in spring 2017, once the local councils of St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland have had the opportunity to review and consider the direction. If the municipalities of St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland agree to create a consolidated transit system to service Niagara, Regional Council will have to provide “triple majority” support for this service direction before steps can be taken to consolidate. A strong, efficient and effective public transit system is critical for Niagara’s future economic growth and prosperity. Inter-municipal transit enables residents to access education, employment, recreation and social services - key elements in a strong, vibrant economy. Local and inter-municipal connections will support daily GO train service coming to Niagara.

Garage and Yard Sales Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Having more than five people gatherings is prohibited in Ontario. This poses a challenge for garage/yard sale hosts to mandate There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to five people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Additional Resources and Information (i.e. Government links) Federal and Provincial Government : Please Refer to the Government of Canada Link for Information to Travellers Arriving in Canada.

The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Having more than five people gatherings is prohibited in Ontario. This poses a challenge for garage/yard sale hosts to mandate There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to five people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Having more than ten people gatherings is prohibited in Ontario. This poses a challenge for garage/yard sale hosts to mandate There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Volunteer Firefighter Recruitment is suspended until further notice, and the Open House scheduled for March 28th was cancelled Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Having more than ten people gatherings is prohibited in Ontario. This poses a challenge for garage/yard sale hosts to mandate There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Having more than ten people gatherings is prohibited in Ontario. This poses a challenge for garage/yard sale hosts to mandate There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.

Garage and Yard Sales Updated June 11 Garage and Yard Sales Could Bring More than People to Your Home Don’t Let COVID-19 be an unwanted visitor in your Front Yard Garage and Yards sales pose a public health risk to homeowners and yard sale buyers. The Facts Are: a majority of people are following social distancing guidelines and won’t attend garage/yard sales Gatherings are not to exceed more than 100 people There are alternatives: Preparing for a garage/yard sale doesn’t have to be a quick turn-around project. Take time to organize the items and put them in a safe place to sell later. Hosting a sale when the Ontario government allows for larger gatherings will benefit everyone and lessen the spread of COVID-19. Selling items on seller market websites (Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace) can help generate revenue while purging your home of unwanted items. Precautions and social distancing are essential if you plan to take this route. An Internet Transaction Zone is available at Niagara Regional Police Services. Find more information and how to access this service, visit niagarapolice.ca/en/community/Internet-Transaction-Zone.aspx# Residents Who Want to Host a Garage/Yard Sale The following guidelines will assist with proper public health and lessen the spread of COVID-19: Limit the number of individuals to ten people (Current Ontario Emergency Management Orders) at any given time during the sale Ensure the ability to practice physical distancing Limit the physical touching of items for sale Have handwashing or sanitizing available Have items marked with prices, minimizing the need for personal interaction Request exact change whenever possible Garbage, Recycling, & Organics Garbage, Recycling & Organics information can be found on the Niagara Region website.
