Not sure why it took us until now to start celebrating but better late than never. What’s… https://t.co/TsJJcvvqYq Search: Thanks to the support of so many local companies (shout outs below) we have been able to distill, bottle and distribute 50,000+ 750mL bottles of sanitizer to first responders all across Ontario. And the need is still there. So we will continue to make and share sanitizer to first responders for as long as they need it, free of charge. But since we understand that the need is there for so many others, we are distilling more of our own grape & rye based spirits (which we would normally be turning into gin + whisky) and making it available to the wider community. Each bottle of sanitizer takes the resources of two bottles of whisky or gin to produce. Option 1 – Sanitizer 750mL bottles ($25 each or 6-pack for $150): this helps cover the packaging, the ethanol (it takes 6L of our wine or 15L of our rye mash to make one bottle), the glycerin and hydrogen peroxide to the WHO guidelines and the labour it takes to distill and bottle. Option 2 – $20 Contribute to the cause: We are still running a skeleton crew but continuing to create sanitizer for first responders full-time. If you wanted to help us keep the lights on and make more for first responders, but aren’t in need of hand sanitizer yourself, we’ve added a donation option since so many people have asked. Your donation allows us to continue to provide sanitizer to first responders free of charge using our own alcohol. We will be distilling and bottling over the next few days to have these bottles available for contactless distillery pick-up or delivery starting April 6th.

But since we understand that the need is there for so many others, we are distilling more of our own grape & rye based spirits (which we would normally be turning into gin + whisky) and making it available to the wider community.

Option 1 – Sanitizer 750mL bottles – both glass and spray bottles ($20 each): this helps cover the packaging, the ethanol (it takes 6L of our wine or 15L of our rye mash to make one bottle), the glycerin and hydrogen peroxide to Health Canada guidelines and the labour it takes to distill and bottle. Option 2 – $20 Contribute to the cause: We are still running a skeleton crew but continuing to create sanitizer for first responders full-time.

And the need is still there. So we will continue to make and share sanitizer to first responders for as long as they need it, free of charge. But since we understand that the need is there for so many others, we have been distilling more of our own grape & rye based spirits (which we would normally be turning into gin + whisky) and making it available to the wider community. Each bottle of sanitizer takes the resources of two bottles of whisky or gin to produce. Option 1 – Sanitizer 750mL bottles – both glass and spray bottles ($20 each): this helps cover the packaging, the ethanol (it takes 6L of our wine or 15L of our rye mash to make one bottle), the glycerin and hydrogen peroxide to Health Canada guidelines and the labour it takes to distill and bottle. Option 2 – $20 Contribute to the cause: We are still running a skeleton crew but continuing to create sanitizer for first responders. If you wanted to help us keep the lights on and make more for first responders, but aren’t in need of hand sanitizer yourself, we’ve added a donation option since so many people have asked. Your donation allows us to continue to provide sanitizer to first responders free of charge using our own alcohol. Natural Product Number: 80098209 Beverage grade alcohol (BUT DON”T DRINK IT) SDS Sheet ORDER NOW If you are a first responder or critical essential service and are in need of sanitizer, please email info@dillons.ca and we will be in touch to help.

But since we understand that the need is there for so many others, we have been distilling more of our own grape & rye based spirits (which we would normally be turning into gin + whisky) and making it available to the wider community.
