All facility rental groups will proceed with the regular rental process as a method to book their appointment at the Community Centre. People who wish to use the walking track will now need to book an appointment. They can do so by contacting Recreation Services from Tuesday to Saturday from 9:00am to 4:00pm at 905-957-3346 ext. 4688. The walking track is open from 9:00am to 9:00pm, seven days per week. Walking track appointments will be limited to one hour bookings. Participants of Preschool Skating, Adult Skating and Shinny do not need individual appointments at this time.
