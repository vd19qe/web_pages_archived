Strategy A Guide to Building a More Resilient Business by Martin Reeves and Kevin Whitaker July 02, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary Mainstream business education and managerial practice is largely focused on managing performance. But as the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the painful fragility of many of our systems, leaders are focusing on resilience — a concept rarely taught in today’s business schools. What is resilience? How do you manage and measure it? And how can you build a more resilient enterprise? Dio5050/Getty Images Leer en español We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. In the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, we have become painfully aware of the fragility of supply chains, health care, and other critical systems. Many leaders have announced the intention to build back their businesses more resiliently, but not many know how to do so. Few business schools teach resilience, and today’s managerial toolkit is dominated by financial performance management. As a result, very few companies are able to explicitly design for, measure, and manage resilience. Why Resilience Is Important We can usefully define resilience as a company’s capacity to absorb stress, recover critical functionality, and thrive in altered circumstances. Resilience is especially important today because the business environment is becoming more dynamic and unpredictable. This is a result of several enduring forces stressing and stretching business systems — from accelerated technological evolution to a greater interconnectedness of the global economy to broader issues such as rising inequality, species depletion, and climate change. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share There is no better example of system stress than the coronavirus crisis. Humans impinging on the natural environment have enhanced the risk of cross-species infections. Dense urban populations facilitated the rapid initial outbreak of the disease. International travel facilitated its global spread. Extended global supply chains have broken down. Economic activity has been massively disrupted, and inequalities and social tensions have been exacerbated. And Covid-19 is not a one-off. SARS, MERS, and Ebola forewarned an inevitable global pandemic, and there is every reason to expect that we will see others in the future. Furthermore, the same circumstances are also conducive to the spread of a cyber-virus and to economic instability that could result from climate change or social tensions. The Challenge of Measuring and Managing Resilience Traditional management approaches have several important limitations that make measuring and achieving resilience difficult: Companies have been designed predominantly to maximize shareholder value from dividends and stock appreciation. Very few companies even attempt to measure resilience beyond merely disclosing specific material risks. Companies and shareholders often focus on maximizing short-term returns. In contrast, resilience requires a multi-timescale perspective: forgoing a certain amount of efficiency or performance today for the sake of more-sustained performance in the future. Companies have been mainly focused on creating and executing stable plans, which works well when causal relationships are clear, predictable, and unchanging. Resilience deals with what is unknown, changeable, unpredictable, and improbable — and has significant consequences. In the current model of corporate capitalism, each company is treated as an economic island to be optimized individually. While this simplifies management and accountability, it masks the extent of economic and social interdependence between different stakeholders. In contrast, resilience is a property of systems: an individual company’s resilience means little if its supply base, customer base, or the social systems upon which it depends are disrupted. Managing for resilience therefore requires more than just grafting new ideas or tools onto today’s approaches. It requires a fundamentally different mental model of business — one that embraces complexity, uncertainty, interdependence, systems thinking, and a multi-timescale perspective. Of course, many companies already undertake some form of risk management — but mostly to understand and minimize exposure to specific, known risks. Resilience must deal also with unidentified risks, and it must consider the adaptations and transformations a company must make to absorb environmental stress and even turn it to advantage. Building Resilient Enterprises Companies can structure their organizations and decision processes for resilience by embracing six principles of long-lasting systems: Redundancy buffers systems against unexpected shocks, albeit at the expense of short-term efficiency. It can be created by duplicating elements (such as by having multiple factories that produce the same product) or by having different elements that achieve the same end (functional redundancy). Diversity of responses to a new stress helps ensure that systems do not fail catastrophically, albeit at the expense of the efficiencies obtainable through standardization. In business, this requires not only employing people from different backgrounds and with different cognitive profiles but also creating an environment that fosters multiple ways of thinking and doing things. Modularity allows individual elements to fail without the whole system collapsing, albeit while forgoing the efficiency of a tightly integrated organizational design. Because a modular organization can be divided into smaller chunks with well-defined interfaces, it is also more understandable and can be rewired more rapidly during a crisis. Adaptability is the ability to evolve through trial and error. It requires a certain level of variance or diversity, obtained through natural or planned experimentation, in combination with an iterative selection mechanism to scale up the ideas that work best. Processes and structures in adaptive organizations are designed for flexibility and learning rather than stability and minimal variance. Prudence involves operating on the precautionary principle that if something could plausibly happen, it eventually will. This calls for developing contingency plans and stress tests for plausible risks with significant consequences — which can be envisioned and prepared for through scenario planning, war games, monitoring early warning signals, analyzing system vulnerabilities, and other techniques. Embeddedness is the alignment of a company’s goals and activities with those of broader systems. It is critical to long-term success because companies are embedded in supply chains, business ecosystems, economies, societies, and natural ecosystems. Articulating a purpose — the way in which a corporation aims to serve important societal needs — is a good way to ensure that the company does not find itself in opposition to society and inviting resistance, restriction, and sanction. Beyond these structural options, a company can deploy migration strategies, such as shifting its business portfolio mix across products, channels, geographies, or business models to maximize opportunities and minimize adversity. The principal lever for this is capital allocation. Most companies tend to spread resources relatively equally across different businesses and units, but extreme circumstances usually need more-decisive reallocation, which requires both the business intelligence and the mental agility to see new risks and opportunities before they become apparent to competitors. A key concept here is sufficiency: Many companies will be seeing and piloting new models under changing conditions, but only those that allocate sufficient capital with sufficient speed will succeed in shifting the center of gravity of their business. Then there are strategies of environmental shaping. To a latecomer in an established market, the business environment is a given. But a pioneer in an emerging opportunity can shape the environment. By imagining possible new realities, especially in dynamic environments, and then realizing them through shaping and persuasion, companies can reduce their exposure to unfavorable shocks. Migration and shaping go beyond risk mitigation by creating and exploiting new opportunities to flourish. Finally, companies can increase their resilience through collaboration with other players. Business ecosystems, such as digital platforms, can increase their collective resilience through access to new capabilities, through increased flexibility, and by reducing the fixed cost of entry into businesses where assets can now be shared. Shared platforms essentially create “real” insurance against the unexpected through investment in shared execution, adaptation, and innovation mechanisms. The Benefits of Resilience When confronted with unanticipated stress, a company that employs resilience principles has multiple advantages that play out sequentially: First is an anticipation benefit, representing the ability to recognize threats faster. Though this may not be immediately manifested in performance, it can be detected via other signals, such as when a company articulates its resilience plans (something most companies were slow to do in the case of Covid-19). It can also drive advantages in subsequent phases. Next is an impact benefit, representing the ability to better resist or withstand the initial shock. This can be achieved through better preparation or a more-agile response. Then there is a recovery speed benefit, representing the ability to rebound from the shock more quickly by identifying the adjustments needed to return to the prior operating level and implementing them swiftly and effectively. Finally, there is an eventual outcomes benefit, representing increased fitness for the new post-shock environment. Cumulatively, the four gaps produce a significant difference in value. As we observed in China during the initial Covid-19 shock, most sectors and companies came down rapidly and synchronously, but during the recovery phase there was a marked divergence in company performance. How to Become a More Resilient Company Crises are opportunities for change. With Covid-19, companies have a unique opportunity and necessity to revisit their business models to build greater systemic resilience, starting with the following six actions. Seek advantage in adversity. Don’t merely endeavor to mitigate risk or damage or restore what was; rather, aim to create advantage in adversity by effectively adjusting to new realities. Look forward. In the short run, a crisis many appear tactical and operational, but on longer timescales, new needs and the incapacitation of competitors create opportunities. Crises can also be the best pretext for accelerating long-term transformational change. One of the key roles for leaders is therefore to shift an organization’s time horizons outward. Take a collaborative, systems view. In stable times, business can be thought of as performance maximization with a given business model in a given context. Resilience, by contrast, concerns how the relationships between a business’s components or between a business and its context change under stress. It requires systems thinking and systemic solutions, which in turn depend on collaboration among employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Measure beyond performance. The health of a business is not captured only by measures of value extracted, which tend to be backward-looking. Measuring flexibility, adaptation, and other components of resilience is critical to building a sustainable business. This can be done quite simply by looking at either benefits or capabilities. Prize diversity. Resilience depends on being able to generate alternative ways of reacting to situations, which in turn depends on the ability to see things with fresh eyes. Resilient businesses prize cognitive diversity and appreciate the value of variation and divergence. Change as the default. Alibaba founder Jack Ma sees change, not stability, as the default. Resilience is less about occasional adjustments under extreme circumstances and more about building organizations and supporting systems predicated on constant change and experimentation. This is partly to avoid rigidity and partly because iterative incremental adjustment is far less risky than a massive one-shot adjustment. With the mainstream of business education and managerial practice focused on managing performance, resilience represents not just an opportunity to mitigate risk but also an opportunity for competitive advantage for enterprises who choose to focus on it. Andy Warhol famously said that in the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. In today’s business world, transient high performance is commonplace; it is sustained performance by resilient companies that stands apart.

Executive Summary Though many people have (very) strong opinions about whether women are managing the pandemic better, it is still too soon to capture data that makes this narrative foolproof. But regardless of how robust the evidence might be, this moment, unlike any we’ve ever known, opens new options for the future. This group of talented leaders may become the first visible wave of role models for the generations to come, redefining the way we pick leaders in politics and business. In short, tales of strong female leaders succeeding through this crisis could lead to a change in the overarching narrative of what a strong leader looks like. Though only time will tell if this new narrative survives the crisis, it would not just elevate the overall quality of our leaders — it would likely increase our trust in the result of our choices.

Countries with women in leadership have suffered six times fewer confirmed deaths from Covid-19 than countries with governments led by men. Unsurprisingly, the media has swelled with stories of their pragmatism, prowess — and humanity. Will these positive outcomes influence our collective readiness to elect and promote more women into power? In both business and politics, leaders of the world have spent the past few months facing a real-time leadership test, played out in the full view of an impatient global audience. A huge crisis, unlike anything seen in our lifetimes, renders experience and expertise irrelevant. Leaders today must learn to lockdown and reopen countries while walking the tightrope between balancing the health of their populations with that of their economies. Their evaluations will be as public as their performances. Instantaneous, global, social-media-documented scrutiny puts their every action and every communication in full view. Whatever the future brings, one thing is certain: those in charge will be judged on how they manage this crisis — and nowhere are the stakes higher than in government. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Heads of states are reluctant participants in this leadership contest, subjected to daily reviews of virus statistics, with journalists as judges. The best way to evaluate leaders’ performance has always been to look at how their teams and followers are performing, especially compared to others. But the pandemic and its grim count of death tolls introduces entirely new pressures: standardized, data-driven global metrics invite people everywhere to easily compare, at the click of a mouse, the relative effectiveness of their elected officials. In this competition, few comments have received more attention than the stellar performance of female leaders. An avalanche of articles have highlighted the female-led countries managing the crisis better. It is claimed their superior performance reflects well-established gender differences in leadership potential. Numerous pieces have dug into individual strengths, celebrating Angela Merkel’s data-driven trustworthiness, Jacinda Ardern’s empathetic rationality, and Tsai Ing-wen’s quiet resilience. We are aware of the (many) nuances and limitations of the data under debate. Generalizations stoking the “gender wars” are an easy way to attract popular debate and discussion. Many people have (very) strong opinions about whether women are managing the pandemic better, and everyone is entitled to their own opinions — but not to their own data. For those who wish to poke holes at the “women are better leaders” arguments, here’s a menu of legitimate qualifiers. Too Few to Tell (sample size): There are not (yet) enough women running countries to legitimately examine gender effects. Women only govern 18 countries or 545 million people globally. That’s 7% of the world’s population — an achievement, nonetheless statistically insignificant. It Wasn’t Her (conflating factors): Scientific studies show leaders typically account for around 30% of the variability in a group’s (including a nation’s) performance. This is not trivial but suggests a range of things determine outcomes unrelated to the leader. Every nation confronted this crisis with its own mix of advantages and disadvantages (e.g., educational level, income, income inequality, weather conditions, density, general demographic profile, etc.). Incumbents inherited existing contexts with consequences. They were dealt a hand and have limited credit and blame for how it turned out. This is less true when a leader has been in charge for a long time and has influenced the starting conditions. It’s the Culture (or, correlation isn’t causality): Correlations can be caused by other factors. Even if you agree that women-led countries are handling the crisis better, there are (at least) two other elements to consider. First, countries do better because they have women in charge. Second, countries have women in charge because they were already doing better (less sexism, more inclusivity, removal of glass ceilings blocking competent women from reaching the top in the first place). You don’t have to be a math whiz to see that if a country (consciously or unconsciously) rejects 50% of its talent for leadership roles, it ends up with less — and lesser — talent. Only the Best (selection bias): One of the paradoxical consequences of sexism is that it elevates the quality of female leaders. Because women need to work harder to persuade others that they have the leadership talent it takes, they end up being more qualified and more talented when they are selected for leadership roles. As a consequence, our high-performing covid-response countries may simply be enjoying the fruits of their higher standards for women, rather than that women are, in themselves, superior. One could then argue, from a fairness standpoint, we should make it easier for less competent women to get to the top. That’s what a Frenchwoman, Françoise Giroud argued 30 years ago. A better solution for the challenges facing us in 2020 would be to make it harder for incompetent men to become leaders. Regardless of how robust the evidence might be, or how logical and data-driven the arguments, add to the mix a change in receptivity of the zeitgeist. A small number of female leaders have emerged as a benchmark for what competent leadership looks like — and been applauded for it. Could this be the moment, then, to replace our old, obsolete leadership archetypes with more pragmatic and meritocratic models? A crisis is often defined as the time between the old being not-ready-to-die, and the new not-quite-ready-to-move-in. Will our post-covid world say goodbye to our persistent preference for tough, bold, and reckless leaders, primarily male and obsessed with themselves? Will we be mature enough to adopt a more balanced perception of leadership talent, one based more on increasing group welfare than on individual showmanship? The roller-coaster ride of gender equality over the past few decades may be depressing to some. But this moment, unlike any we’ve ever known, opens new options for the future — millions of them, in fact. This group of talented leaders may become the first visible wave of role models for the generations to come, redefining the way we pick leaders in politics and business. In short, tales of strong female leaders succeeding through this crisis could lead to a change in the overarching narrative of what a strong leader looks like. Society at large may become less surprised and more accepting of leaders (s)elected on their expertise, intelligence, curiosity, humility, empathy, and integrity. Though only time will tell if this new narrative survives the crisis, we hope it will. It would not just elevate the overall quality of our leaders — it would likely increase our trust in the result of our choices. The world didn’t need a pandemic to realize that people are generally better off when their leaders are smart, honest, and modest. But we are glad to see the public, and especially the media, fall in love with the leaders who display these qualities — daily and publicly — while keeping their nations safe at the same time. It’s a lesson we think will bear fruit, and multiply. If our free content helps you to contend with these challenges, please consider subscribing to HBR.

Economics & Society Are Our Management Theories Outdated? by Gianpiero Petriglieri June 18, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Management thinking and practice have reached an inflection point. This “mid-life crisis” of management bears much resemblance to the same phenomenon in our own lives, but in this case we are preoccupied as much with the death of capitalism and our global system as we are with the mortality of our own bodies. Only by bidding adieu to the instrumental character of management can we start to reshape it into something new, something freer and more meaningful that’s focused more on what we’re trying to achieve and why, rather than how to do it faster and more efficiently. Marcelo Santos/Getty Images Leer en español “Where are the new management theories?” an acute observer of management trends asked me at a gathering of executives, academics, and journalists focused on the future of work. It was a few months ago, and no one expected the future to arrive as quickly as it has, or in the way that it has. I had heard that question before — it’s a staple of those gatherings — but I’ve been thinking about it a lot since work as we knew it has ground to a halt. Theories bind analysis and action and, especially in times of change, when the future becomes unpredictable and anxiety is running high, managers need theories to provide clarity and reassurance. Scientific management. Human relations. Competitive advantage. Shareholder value maximization. Disruptive innovation. These are only a few of the theories that have moved management over the past century, offering it a rationale, a script, and at times a justification for action. They have shaped management, too, conveying an image of who managers must be. Take scientific management — best known as Taylorism — arguably the most enduring management theory of them all. It suggests that a manager’s job is to increase efficiency in a production system. The manager then, rendered in the image of Dr. Taylor, must be a detached engineer who sifts through data to counter the most common source of error: people. I should know about new theories since I am, after all, a management professor. But I’ve been drawing a blank. To be sure, there was no lack of new management hacks even before the upheaval of the past few months. Management stories abound, covering the whole range from epic to comedic to outright tragic tales. Executives have visions, pledge their allegiance to evidence, and even pen manifestos. But new theories? They seem to be nowhere in sight. Even management academics are distraught, doubting that old management theories still apply in organizations ruled by algorithms, and wondering whether anyone is up to developing new ones. But this lack of new theories is a concern not just for me, my conference friend, many a manager, and the authors I just cited. It affects you, too. Regardless of your age, and whether you are a manager or not, you are caught with us in a mid-life crisis of management. The signs of that crisis transpire in many an everyday experience. Perhaps you feel uneasy and restless, sensing that we will not be going back to “normal” in the workplace, if we even still have one. Or you feel stuck and swing between frustration and despair, wondering who is in charge and what is yet to come. You feel anger at the system, not to mention mistrust; you feel loneliness and dearth of meaning. Those aren’t just signs of grief at the way life has forced us to change in the past few months and weeks — our unease and despair have been brewing since long before that. The more we reach for new theories, however, the more uneasy and stuck we become. That’s because the issue that sparks mid-life crises is unlike most of the challenges that management is fit to analyze and solve. It is an existential one. And yet it must be faced. Our lives depend on it. It is the issue of death — and the question of what to do with whatever freedom, time, and energy we have left. You read that right. I am arguing that the unease that many have felt at work over the past months and years and feel most acutely now, in the face of a global health and social crisis, is not due to managers’ inability to prepare for the future. It is due to management’s unwillingness to contemplate a shortage of its own future that is only becoming more obvious and urgent. A shortage of future that concerns management as an idea and a practice, not just the fate of individual managers. Such denial, still on display in many organizations even today, is dangerous as well as unfortunate. Mid-life crises are often unpleasant but productive affairs. Death, when we can confront it, forces us to consider not just how we live, but also why we exist. It mobilizes our intellect and imagination towards better ways and bigger whys. While it begins as the absence of meaning and hope, a mid-life crisis can be a source of both. It can transform us — changing us in pervasive and permanent ways. It can free us up — helping us defy dated obligations. And it can humanize us — deepening connections with others and ourselves. That humanization is much needed, as many have been pointing out, but it must go much further than the usual rhetoric of purposeful leadership, an airbrushing of humanism to make management nicer. It must become its core. There is much to gain, if we can work through the crisis. But first let us consider where it comes from. * * * A mid-life crisis needs not be sparked by the realization of our actual, physical death. It can be sparked by awareness that the world as we knew it, or a worldview we held dear, is failing. (Though, indeed, a failing worldview often begets physical death, since fraying social bodies amplify the frailty of the individual ones that make them up.) Mid-life crises erupt at existential turning points, between a state that is no longer viable and one that is not yet conceivable. Seen that way management has been having a mid-life crisis for a while. Because capitalism — the worldview that most management theories and tools have long been drafted to sustain and advance — is at an existential juncture. We are no longer just asking how to make it work. Many now wonder why (and for whom) it exists. Some are even asking if it is viable any more. “Capitalism as we know it is dead,” Marc Benioff declared, three weeks into the 2020s. Speaking from the main stage to a packed auditorium at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Salesforce CEO made an unlikely eulogist. Benioff was inviting his peers to put to rest the ultra-capitalism concerned only with itself, obsessed with growth and profits and blind, if not outright hostile, to its environmental and social context. The strand of capitalism on display daily in macro trends like the emergence of “winners take all” societies, and micro moves like a concern for ailing markets during a pandemic. We might debate whether ultra-capitalism is dead. But as the planet burns, inequality rises, people suffer, and geopolitics become ever more tense, there are few doubts that it is deadly. Much of the harm ultra-capitalism does occurs through its management, more precisely, through the unquestioned practice of a dehumanized view of how management works and should work. It’s an instrumental view that casts it as a technology of sorts, a means to an end, a tool to maximize efficiency, alignment, and performance—even when seemingly acting with concern and care for people. It neglects anything that does not affect performance, and its influence reaches so deep we often use it to manage even our own selves, say, every time we tell ourselves that we ought to sleep, exercise, or read a novel so we can be more productive at work, rather than because our lives are healthier and richer and freer for it. Consider, for example, most management research or popular management writing. It is predicated on a portrait of management, when done well, as the way to predict and solve practical problems. And it is dedicated to offering prescriptions for managers to address those problems. How do I make decisions? How can I be heard? How can I stay productive? How do I help my team succeed? In many circumstances, the theories and tools that help answer instrumental questions suffice. But they are of little help when existential questions surface, such as, How long will we be around? Do we matter? Are we in charge? Those are mid-life questions, for individuals. And they are the very questions we ask ever more often of management at this existential juncture. * * * Those questions are growing louder, and those who were meant to bury ultra-capitalism, if anything, are rushing to its deathbed to resuscitate it, arguing that their previous success makes them best equipped to solve social ills, or selling out our health and privacy for profit. Trying to change the world without wanting to change our world is a classic sign of mid-life and a common defense when our worldviews collapse. Only offering to lend one’s hand and means can be a way to assure that one will remain valuable and central even in a new world. (It’s also a way to pursue the most ultra-capitalist of aspirations—a revolution without revolutionaries). “Everything must change so that everything can stay the same,” utters the Prince of Salina facing his loss of standing in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s masterpiece “The Leopard.” I have heard the quote used as a positive example of managerial pragmatism, but in the novel, the fictional Prince urging his family to forge bonds with the armies of a rival monarch and the family of a business leader is the epitome of shapeshifting power. He is interested only in remaining in place and postponing collapse until after he is gone. His words, I am afraid, would not be out of place in the mouth of those who seek new ideas and tools only to remain in charge. Ultimately, however, this approach is not enough. If we want to change the world, we need to change our world first. That means that those who aspire to give birth to a new brand of capitalism must kill the old brand of management first. When I say that we must kill management, I do not mean terminating managers, the people. Replacing them with algorithms, for example, risks making management more instrumental than it already is. The AI-run workplace achieves degrees of control that surpass Frederick Taylor’s wildest dreams. Replacing old managers with new managers will not do either. It would be useless, if new ones embody the same principles with a different style. Instead, When I say we need to kill management, I mean putting to rest the way we conceive and portray and practice management. We — you and me, people who attend gatherings and read magazine features on the future of work, and everyone else who brings management to life in words, in writing, or in their daily work — need to change our conception of management, of its function in any enterprise. What do we replace it with? We need a truly human management, one that makes room for our bodies and spirits alongside our intellect and skills. That cares for what work does and feels and means to us, not just for what we can do at work and how. A management that abjures the relentless pursuit of efficiency and alignment — and celebrates, or even just acknowledges the inconsistencies that make us human. A management that pursues existential growth as passionately as it pursues instrumental growth — that is, one that pursues the expansion of our consciousness alongside that of our powers. One where we can be fully human, with all our contradictions, in pluralistic institutions. A human management will demand that we incorporate a concern for the freedom and well-being of those we manage as much as for their productivity; that we consider the environmental as well as the economic consequences of strategic choices; that we stop pleading powerlessness in the face of the tyranny of technology and take responsibility to reject technologies that enable tyranny. That we hear and amplify a broader set of voices, not only those that fit a narrow view of management and of its concerns, but also those that defy it, and in so doing, enliven it. That kind of management might advance a capitalism based on curiosity and compassion, therefore one that is much better at innovation and inclusion than its current form. One can see glimpses of such a human view of management already. You can see them in the CEOs who talk about caring about purpose as much as about profit. You can see them in people’s longing for meaning and community at work. But for those claims not to ring hollow and those longings not to go unmet, management as we know it, really, it has to die. There is no other way. Because, in truth, it does not have a problem. It is the problem. *** The challenge facing management is not the lack of new theories; it is the strength of the old ones. It is impossible to build the future using the blueprints of the past. It is like going to a plastic surgeon to restore our looks when we should see a psychoanalyst to free our mind instead. That is what management could use more of these days, I have argued in a recent paper on which this essay is based. More psychoanalysis, that is. I kid you not. Especially the branch of psychoanalysis concerned with systems of organization and people’s experience in organizations. A line of work that challenges organizations’ dysfunctional cultures and people’s fascination with neurotic leaders, one that aims to free us up from constraints of the past. You could call psychoanalysis a theory, or a tool. I would not disagree. (There’s my management theory for our times). But I am using it here as shorthand for a subversive conversation. A relationship that helps us examine why we fear what we want and what our theories cost us when they become beliefs. That is, when solutions to old problems become reasons for our stuckness. Seen through this lens, the essence of a mid-life crisis is confinement. Theories that we learned early on, and kept us going, have come to keep us captive. For individuals, those are usually personal theories about how to get on. You must always work hard. (What for?) You can rest after the next promotion. (Really?) Prove that you can make it alone. (But why?) Always work to fit in. (At what cost?) For management, these are theories we picked up at school, from books, and from role models at work. Popular theories like the ones I mentioned earlier, or more local ones in our organizations. Managers, say, must put shareholders first, or keep people in line. Those theories might have kept us safe and made us successful, at one point. They worked for us and so we worked for them. Until their magic stopped, usually because we could not change, were confronted with death, or both. Those theories fail us then because they show us how to keep going without telling us why. When change is needed or death is in the horizon, that will neither soothe us nor suffice us. The question we need to answer is no longer, “what works best?”; it is “what is worth living for?” Psychoanalysis asks that question and in so doing frees us when the confinement becomes too much. “People come for psychoanalysis—or choose someone to have a conversation with—when they find that they can no longer keep a secret,” writes renowned British analyst Adam Phillips. “What was once private has become, in spite of oneself, unbearable.” A mid-life crisis is a euphemism for the realization that the instrumental answers that theories generate from data do not fit existential questions. Theories are of limited use without a purpose. They are, eventually, unbearable. So is the idea of management we have clung to for a century. This is why existential threats, when we confront them, can end up freeing us up. They broaden our horizon, by reminding us that we need more than theories and that we are more than tools. With insight and support, we often emerge from a mid-life crisis with more spacious view of who we are, more forgiving, more generous, more resolute and tolerant at once, more likely to balance our concern for the mechanics and morals of our actions. If it can face its own mid-life crisis, then, management might be on the brink of a real transformation. It might even use the current health and social crises as opportunities to demonstrate, not just tout, its commitment to humanity. For that, however, we do not need new theories of management. We need a broader purpose for it. And we need that purpose to emerge not in bold pronouncements but in ongoing conversations, with ourselves and others, that challenge instrumental theories. Those conversations are far more useful at existential junctures like this. They are a far better means to free us up and join us in bringing about a human turn in management—and ultimately in our relationships with each other, with technology, and with the planet in the workplace. Those who are still skeptical of pronunciations such as “capitalism as we know it is dead,” and mistrust the commitment to transformation of those who have benefited from ultra-capitalism, base their critique on a sound principle. We usually like to change the world if we can, but not to the extent that it puts our identities are at stake. Unless we are in a mid-life crisis, that is. Then, an existential view suggests, people are often capable of becoming a threat to their old world-views, of killing an old self that gets in the way of the future. If efficiency is the aim of instrumentalism, freedom is the aim of existentialism. Deepening our humanity, in business, politics, and every other field, requires an equal devotion to both. The day that freedom is as central as efficiency to its practice, we might declare management dead and welcome it to a new life.

Strategy A Guide to Building a More Resilient Business by Martin Reeves and Kevin Whitaker July 02, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary Mainstream business education and managerial practice is largely focused on managing performance. But as the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the painful fragility of many of our systems, leaders are focusing on resilience — a concept rarely taught in today’s business schools. What is resilience? How do you manage and measure it? And how can you build a more resilient enterprise? Dio5050/Getty Images Leer en español We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. In the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, we have become painfully aware of the fragility of supply chains, health care, and other critical systems. Many leaders have announced the intention to build back their businesses more resiliently, but not many know how to do so. Few business schools teach resilience, and today’s managerial toolkit is dominated by financial performance management. As a result, very few companies are able to explicitly design for, measure, and manage resilience. Why Resilience Is Important We can usefully define resilience as a company’s capacity to absorb stress, recover critical functionality, and thrive in altered circumstances. Resilience is especially important today because the business environment is becoming more dynamic and unpredictable. This is a result of several enduring forces stressing and stretching business systems — from accelerated technological evolution to a greater interconnectedness of the global economy to broader issues such as rising inequality, species depletion, and climate change. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share There is no better example of system stress than the coronavirus crisis. Humans impinging on the natural environment have enhanced the risk of cross-species infections. Dense urban populations facilitated the rapid initial outbreak of the disease. International travel facilitated its global spread. Extended global supply chains have broken down. Economic activity has been massively disrupted, and inequalities and social tensions have been exacerbated. And Covid-19 is not a one-off. SARS, MERS, and Ebola forewarned an inevitable global pandemic, and there is every reason to expect that we will see others in the future. Furthermore, the same circumstances are also conducive to the spread of a cyber-virus and to economic instability that could result from climate change or social tensions. The Challenge of Measuring and Managing Resilience Traditional management approaches have several important limitations that make measuring and achieving resilience difficult: Companies have been designed predominantly to maximize shareholder value from dividends and stock appreciation. Very few companies even attempt to measure resilience beyond merely disclosing specific material risks. Companies and shareholders often focus on maximizing short-term returns. In contrast, resilience requires a multi-timescale perspective: forgoing a certain amount of efficiency or performance today for the sake of more-sustained performance in the future. Companies have been mainly focused on creating and executing stable plans, which works well when causal relationships are clear, predictable, and unchanging. Resilience deals with what is unknown, changeable, unpredictable, and improbable — and has significant consequences. In the current model of corporate capitalism, each company is treated as an economic island to be optimized individually. While this simplifies management and accountability, it masks the extent of economic and social interdependence between different stakeholders. In contrast, resilience is a property of systems: an individual company’s resilience means little if its supply base, customer base, or the social systems upon which it depends are disrupted. Managing for resilience therefore requires more than just grafting new ideas or tools onto today’s approaches. It requires a fundamentally different mental model of business — one that embraces complexity, uncertainty, interdependence, systems thinking, and a multi-timescale perspective. Of course, many companies already undertake some form of risk management — but mostly to understand and minimize exposure to specific, known risks. Resilience must deal also with unidentified risks, and it must consider the adaptations and transformations a company must make to absorb environmental stress and even turn it to advantage. Building Resilient Enterprises Companies can structure their organizations and decision processes for resilience by embracing six principles of long-lasting systems: Redundancy buffers systems against unexpected shocks, albeit at the expense of short-term efficiency. It can be created by duplicating elements (such as by having multiple factories that produce the same product) or by having different elements that achieve the same end (functional redundancy). Diversity of responses to a new stress helps ensure that systems do not fail catastrophically, albeit at the expense of the efficiencies obtainable through standardization. In business, this requires not only employing people from different backgrounds and with different cognitive profiles but also creating an environment that fosters multiple ways of thinking and doing things. Modularity allows individual elements to fail without the whole system collapsing, albeit while forgoing the efficiency of a tightly integrated organizational design. Because a modular organization can be divided into smaller chunks with well-defined interfaces, it is also more understandable and can be rewired more rapidly during a crisis. Adaptability is the ability to evolve through trial and error. It requires a certain level of variance or diversity, obtained through natural or planned experimentation, in combination with an iterative selection mechanism to scale up the ideas that work best. Processes and structures in adaptive organizations are designed for flexibility and learning rather than stability and minimal variance. Prudence involves operating on the precautionary principle that if something could plausibly happen, it eventually will. This calls for developing contingency plans and stress tests for plausible risks with significant consequences — which can be envisioned and prepared for through scenario planning, war games, monitoring early warning signals, analyzing system vulnerabilities, and other techniques. Embeddedness is the alignment of a company’s goals and activities with those of broader systems. It is critical to long-term success because companies are embedded in supply chains, business ecosystems, economies, societies, and natural ecosystems. Articulating a purpose — the way in which a corporation aims to serve important societal needs — is a good way to ensure that the company does not find itself in opposition to society and inviting resistance, restriction, and sanction. Beyond these structural options, a company can deploy migration strategies, such as shifting its business portfolio mix across products, channels, geographies, or business models to maximize opportunities and minimize adversity. The principal lever for this is capital allocation. Most companies tend to spread resources relatively equally across different businesses and units, but extreme circumstances usually need more-decisive reallocation, which requires both the business intelligence and the mental agility to see new risks and opportunities before they become apparent to competitors. A key concept here is sufficiency: Many companies will be seeing and piloting new models under changing conditions, but only those that allocate sufficient capital with sufficient speed will succeed in shifting the center of gravity of their business. Then there are strategies of environmental shaping. To a latecomer in an established market, the business environment is a given. But a pioneer in an emerging opportunity can shape the environment. By imagining possible new realities, especially in dynamic environments, and then realizing them through shaping and persuasion, companies can reduce their exposure to unfavorable shocks. Migration and shaping go beyond risk mitigation by creating and exploiting new opportunities to flourish. Finally, companies can increase their resilience through collaboration with other players. Business ecosystems, such as digital platforms, can increase their collective resilience through access to new capabilities, through increased flexibility, and by reducing the fixed cost of entry into businesses where assets can now be shared. Shared platforms essentially create “real” insurance against the unexpected through investment in shared execution, adaptation, and innovation mechanisms. The Benefits of Resilience When confronted with unanticipated stress, a company that employs resilience principles has multiple advantages that play out sequentially: First is an anticipation benefit, representing the ability to recognize threats faster. Though this may not be immediately manifested in performance, it can be detected via other signals, such as when a company articulates its resilience plans (something most companies were slow to do in the case of Covid-19). It can also drive advantages in subsequent phases. Next is an impact benefit, representing the ability to better resist or withstand the initial shock. This can be achieved through better preparation or a more-agile response. Then there is a recovery speed benefit, representing the ability to rebound from the shock more quickly by identifying the adjustments needed to return to the prior operating level and implementing them swiftly and effectively. Finally, there is an eventual outcomes benefit, representing increased fitness for the new post-shock environment. Cumulatively, the four gaps produce a significant difference in value. As we observed in China during the initial Covid-19 shock, most sectors and companies came down rapidly and synchronously, but during the recovery phase there was a marked divergence in company performance. How to Become a More Resilient Company Crises are opportunities for change. With Covid-19, companies have a unique opportunity and necessity to revisit their business models to build greater systemic resilience, starting with the following six actions. Seek advantage in adversity. Don’t merely endeavor to mitigate risk or damage or restore what was; rather, aim to create advantage in adversity by effectively adjusting to new realities. Look forward. In the short run, a crisis many appear tactical and operational, but on longer timescales, new needs and the incapacitation of competitors create opportunities. Crises can also be the best pretext for accelerating long-term transformational change. One of the key roles for leaders is therefore to shift an organization’s time horizons outward. Take a collaborative, systems view. In stable times, business can be thought of as performance maximization with a given business model in a given context. Resilience, by contrast, concerns how the relationships between a business’s components or between a business and its context change under stress. It requires systems thinking and systemic solutions, which in turn depend on collaboration among employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Measure beyond performance. The health of a business is not captured only by measures of value extracted, which tend to be backward-looking. Measuring flexibility, adaptation, and other components of resilience is critical to building a sustainable business. This can be done quite simply by looking at either benefits or capabilities. Prize diversity. Resilience depends on being able to generate alternative ways of reacting to situations, which in turn depends on the ability to see things with fresh eyes. Resilient businesses prize cognitive diversity and appreciate the value of variation and divergence. Change as the default. Alibaba founder Jack Ma sees change, not stability, as the default. Resilience is less about occasional adjustments under extreme circumstances and more about building organizations and supporting systems predicated on constant change and experimentation. This is partly to avoid rigidity and partly because iterative incremental adjustment is far less risky than a massive one-shot adjustment. With the mainstream of business education and managerial practice focused on managing performance, resilience represents not just an opportunity to mitigate risk but also an opportunity for competitive advantage for enterprises who choose to focus on it. Andy Warhol famously said that in the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. In today’s business world, transient high performance is commonplace; it is sustained performance by resilient companies that stands apart.

Economics & Society Are Our Management Theories Outdated? by Gianpiero Petriglieri June 18, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Management thinking and practice have reached an inflection point. This “mid-life crisis” of management bears much resemblance to the same phenomenon in our own lives, but in this case we are preoccupied as much with the death of capitalism and our global system as we are with the mortality of our own bodies. Only by bidding adieu to the instrumental character of management can we start to reshape it into something new, something freer and more meaningful that’s focused more on what we’re trying to achieve and why, rather than how to do it faster and more efficiently. Marcelo Santos/Getty Images Leer en español “Where are the new management theories?” an acute observer of management trends asked me at a gathering of executives, academics, and journalists focused on the future of work. It was a few months ago, and no one expected the future to arrive as quickly as it has, or in the way that it has. I had heard that question before — it’s a staple of those gatherings — but I’ve been thinking about it a lot since work as we knew it has ground to a halt. Theories bind analysis and action and, especially in times of change, when the future becomes unpredictable and anxiety is running high, managers need theories to provide clarity and reassurance. Scientific management. Human relations. Competitive advantage. Shareholder value maximization. Disruptive innovation. These are only a few of the theories that have moved management over the past century, offering it a rationale, a script, and at times a justification for action. They have shaped management, too, conveying an image of who managers must be. Take scientific management — best known as Taylorism — arguably the most enduring management theory of them all. It suggests that a manager’s job is to increase efficiency in a production system. The manager then, rendered in the image of Dr. Taylor, must be a detached engineer who sifts through data to counter the most common source of error: people. I should know about new theories since I am, after all, a management professor. But I’ve been drawing a blank. To be sure, there was no lack of new management hacks even before the upheaval of the past few months. Management stories abound, covering the whole range from epic to comedic to outright tragic tales. Executives have visions, pledge their allegiance to evidence, and even pen manifestos. But new theories? They seem to be nowhere in sight. Even management academics are distraught, doubting that old management theories still apply in organizations ruled by algorithms, and wondering whether anyone is up to developing new ones. But this lack of new theories is a concern not just for me, my conference friend, many a manager, and the authors I just cited. It affects you, too. Regardless of your age, and whether you are a manager or not, you are caught with us in a mid-life crisis of management. The signs of that crisis transpire in many an everyday experience. Perhaps you feel uneasy and restless, sensing that we will not be going back to “normal” in the workplace, if we even still have one. Or you feel stuck and swing between frustration and despair, wondering who is in charge and what is yet to come. You feel anger at the system, not to mention mistrust; you feel loneliness and dearth of meaning. Those aren’t just signs of grief at the way life has forced us to change in the past few months and weeks — our unease and despair have been brewing since long before that. The more we reach for new theories, however, the more uneasy and stuck we become. That’s because the issue that sparks mid-life crises is unlike most of the challenges that management is fit to analyze and solve. It is an existential one. And yet it must be faced. Our lives depend on it. It is the issue of death — and the question of what to do with whatever freedom, time, and energy we have left. You read that right. I am arguing that the unease that many have felt at work over the past months and years and feel most acutely now, in the face of a global health and social crisis, is not due to managers’ inability to prepare for the future. It is due to management’s unwillingness to contemplate a shortage of its own future that is only becoming more obvious and urgent. A shortage of future that concerns management as an idea and a practice, not just the fate of individual managers. Such denial, still on display in many organizations even today, is dangerous as well as unfortunate. Mid-life crises are often unpleasant but productive affairs. Death, when we can confront it, forces us to consider not just how we live, but also why we exist. It mobilizes our intellect and imagination towards better ways and bigger whys. While it begins as the absence of meaning and hope, a mid-life crisis can be a source of both. It can transform us — changing us in pervasive and permanent ways. It can free us up — helping us defy dated obligations. And it can humanize us — deepening connections with others and ourselves. That humanization is much needed, as many have been pointing out, but it must go much further than the usual rhetoric of purposeful leadership, an airbrushing of humanism to make management nicer. It must become its core. There is much to gain, if we can work through the crisis. But first let us consider where it comes from. * * * A mid-life crisis needs not be sparked by the realization of our actual, physical death. It can be sparked by awareness that the world as we knew it, or a worldview we held dear, is failing. (Though, indeed, a failing worldview often begets physical death, since fraying social bodies amplify the frailty of the individual ones that make them up.) Mid-life crises erupt at existential turning points, between a state that is no longer viable and one that is not yet conceivable. Seen that way management has been having a mid-life crisis for a while. Because capitalism — the worldview that most management theories and tools have long been drafted to sustain and advance — is at an existential juncture. We are no longer just asking how to make it work. Many now wonder why (and for whom) it exists. Some are even asking if it is viable any more. “Capitalism as we know it is dead,” Marc Benioff declared, three weeks into the 2020s. Speaking from the main stage to a packed auditorium at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Salesforce CEO made an unlikely eulogist. Benioff was inviting his peers to put to rest the ultra-capitalism concerned only with itself, obsessed with growth and profits and blind, if not outright hostile, to its environmental and social context. The strand of capitalism on display daily in macro trends like the emergence of “winners take all” societies, and micro moves like a concern for ailing markets during a pandemic. We might debate whether ultra-capitalism is dead. But as the planet burns, inequality rises, people suffer, and geopolitics become ever more tense, there are few doubts that it is deadly. Much of the harm ultra-capitalism does occurs through its management, more precisely, through the unquestioned practice of a dehumanized view of how management works and should work. It’s an instrumental view that casts it as a technology of sorts, a means to an end, a tool to maximize efficiency, alignment, and performance—even when seemingly acting with concern and care for people. It neglects anything that does not affect performance, and its influence reaches so deep we often use it to manage even our own selves, say, every time we tell ourselves that we ought to sleep, exercise, or read a novel so we can be more productive at work, rather than because our lives are healthier and richer and freer for it. Consider, for example, most management research or popular management writing. It is predicated on a portrait of management, when done well, as the way to predict and solve practical problems. And it is dedicated to offering prescriptions for managers to address those problems. How do I make decisions? How can I be heard? How can I stay productive? How do I help my team succeed? In many circumstances, the theories and tools that help answer instrumental questions suffice. But they are of little help when existential questions surface, such as, How long will we be around? Do we matter? Are we in charge? Those are mid-life questions, for individuals. And they are the very questions we ask ever more often of management at this existential juncture. * * * Those questions are growing louder, and those who were meant to bury ultra-capitalism, if anything, are rushing to its deathbed to resuscitate it, arguing that their previous success makes them best equipped to solve social ills, or selling out our health and privacy for profit. Trying to change the world without wanting to change our world is a classic sign of mid-life and a common defense when our worldviews collapse. Only offering to lend one’s hand and means can be a way to assure that one will remain valuable and central even in a new world. (It’s also a way to pursue the most ultra-capitalist of aspirations—a revolution without revolutionaries). “Everything must change so that everything can stay the same,” utters the Prince of Salina facing his loss of standing in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s masterpiece “The Leopard.” I have heard the quote used as a positive example of managerial pragmatism, but in the novel, the fictional Prince urging his family to forge bonds with the armies of a rival monarch and the family of a business leader is the epitome of shapeshifting power. He is interested only in remaining in place and postponing collapse until after he is gone. His words, I am afraid, would not be out of place in the mouth of those who seek new ideas and tools only to remain in charge. Ultimately, however, this approach is not enough. If we want to change the world, we need to change our world first. That means that those who aspire to give birth to a new brand of capitalism must kill the old brand of management first. When I say that we must kill management, I do not mean terminating managers, the people. Replacing them with algorithms, for example, risks making management more instrumental than it already is. The AI-run workplace achieves degrees of control that surpass Frederick Taylor’s wildest dreams. Replacing old managers with new managers will not do either. It would be useless, if new ones embody the same principles with a different style. Instead, When I say we need to kill management, I mean putting to rest the way we conceive and portray and practice management. We — you and me, people who attend gatherings and read magazine features on the future of work, and everyone else who brings management to life in words, in writing, or in their daily work — need to change our conception of management, of its function in any enterprise. What do we replace it with? We need a truly human management, one that makes room for our bodies and spirits alongside our intellect and skills. That cares for what work does and feels and means to us, not just for what we can do at work and how. A management that abjures the relentless pursuit of efficiency and alignment — and celebrates, or even just acknowledges the inconsistencies that make us human. A management that pursues existential growth as passionately as it pursues instrumental growth — that is, one that pursues the expansion of our consciousness alongside that of our powers. One where we can be fully human, with all our contradictions, in pluralistic institutions. A human management will demand that we incorporate a concern for the freedom and well-being of those we manage as much as for their productivity; that we consider the environmental as well as the economic consequences of strategic choices; that we stop pleading powerlessness in the face of the tyranny of technology and take responsibility to reject technologies that enable tyranny. That we hear and amplify a broader set of voices, not only those that fit a narrow view of management and of its concerns, but also those that defy it, and in so doing, enliven it. That kind of management might advance a capitalism based on curiosity and compassion, therefore one that is much better at innovation and inclusion than its current form. One can see glimpses of such a human view of management already. You can see them in the CEOs who talk about caring about purpose as much as about profit. You can see them in people’s longing for meaning and community at work. But for those claims not to ring hollow and those longings not to go unmet, management as we know it, really, it has to die. There is no other way. Because, in truth, it does not have a problem. It is the problem. *** The challenge facing management is not the lack of new theories; it is the strength of the old ones. It is impossible to build the future using the blueprints of the past. It is like going to a plastic surgeon to restore our looks when we should see a psychoanalyst to free our mind instead. That is what management could use more of these days, I have argued in a recent paper on which this essay is based. More psychoanalysis, that is. I kid you not. Especially the branch of psychoanalysis concerned with systems of organization and people’s experience in organizations. A line of work that challenges organizations’ dysfunctional cultures and people’s fascination with neurotic leaders, one that aims to free us up from constraints of the past. You could call psychoanalysis a theory, or a tool. I would not disagree. (There’s my management theory for our times). But I am using it here as shorthand for a subversive conversation. A relationship that helps us examine why we fear what we want and what our theories cost us when they become beliefs. That is, when solutions to old problems become reasons for our stuckness. Seen through this lens, the essence of a mid-life crisis is confinement. Theories that we learned early on, and kept us going, have come to keep us captive. For individuals, those are usually personal theories about how to get on. You must always work hard. (What for?) You can rest after the next promotion. (Really?) Prove that you can make it alone. (But why?) Always work to fit in. (At what cost?) For management, these are theories we picked up at school, from books, and from role models at work. Popular theories like the ones I mentioned earlier, or more local ones in our organizations. Managers, say, must put shareholders first, or keep people in line. Those theories might have kept us safe and made us successful, at one point. They worked for us and so we worked for them. Until their magic stopped, usually because we could not change, were confronted with death, or both. Those theories fail us then because they show us how to keep going without telling us why. When change is needed or death is in the horizon, that will neither soothe us nor suffice us. The question we need to answer is no longer, “what works best?”; it is “what is worth living for?” Psychoanalysis asks that question and in so doing frees us when the confinement becomes too much. “People come for psychoanalysis—or choose someone to have a conversation with—when they find that they can no longer keep a secret,” writes renowned British analyst Adam Phillips. “What was once private has become, in spite of oneself, unbearable.” A mid-life crisis is a euphemism for the realization that the instrumental answers that theories generate from data do not fit existential questions. Theories are of limited use without a purpose. They are, eventually, unbearable. So is the idea of management we have clung to for a century. This is why existential threats, when we confront them, can end up freeing us up. They broaden our horizon, by reminding us that we need more than theories and that we are more than tools. With insight and support, we often emerge from a mid-life crisis with more spacious view of who we are, more forgiving, more generous, more resolute and tolerant at once, more likely to balance our concern for the mechanics and morals of our actions. If it can face its own mid-life crisis, then, management might be on the brink of a real transformation. It might even use the current health and social crises as opportunities to demonstrate, not just tout, its commitment to humanity. For that, however, we do not need new theories of management. We need a broader purpose for it. And we need that purpose to emerge not in bold pronouncements but in ongoing conversations, with ourselves and others, that challenge instrumental theories. Those conversations are far more useful at existential junctures like this. They are a far better means to free us up and join us in bringing about a human turn in management—and ultimately in our relationships with each other, with technology, and with the planet in the workplace. Those who are still skeptical of pronunciations such as “capitalism as we know it is dead,” and mistrust the commitment to transformation of those who have benefited from ultra-capitalism, base their critique on a sound principle. We usually like to change the world if we can, but not to the extent that it puts our identities are at stake. Unless we are in a mid-life crisis, that is. Then, an existential view suggests, people are often capable of becoming a threat to their old world-views, of killing an old self that gets in the way of the future. If efficiency is the aim of instrumentalism, freedom is the aim of existentialism. Deepening our humanity, in business, politics, and every other field, requires an equal devotion to both. The day that freedom is as central as efficiency to its practice, we might declare management dead and welcome it to a new life.

Operations What Safe Shopping Looks Like During the Pandemic by Robert Shumsky and Laurens Debo July 24, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary Whether they stayed open through the pandemic or are just starting to reopen, retailers are confronting a variety of state guidelines to help them implement social distancing. While there is no one-sized-fits-all solution, the authors offer three general principles, based on the fundamentals of operations management, their research on traffic flow within stores, and the best information available about the transmission of the virus. First, lower density and speed up customer flow within stores. Second, manage variability to decrease the chances of customer “collisions.” And third, use nudges to encourage safe behavior.

To limit the spread of Covid-19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that individuals practice social distancing. When local conditions allow for retail stores to open, they confront a variety of guidelines that vary by state. For example North Carolina places specific limits on the number of customers allowed per square foot, while Oregon generally advises that the number of customers in the store should be limited so that customers can remain six feet apart. Whether or not customers are required by law to wear masks in stores depends on the state. How retailers implement these guidelines also varies among types of retailers and even within store categories. Grocery stores, for example, have adopted a wide variety of specific methods to ensure that customers remain apart. These variations are due to differences in the prevalence of the virus, diversity in local attitudes toward social distancing, and political forces. It is also difficult to formulate and implement guidelines that apply to all types of stores because of variations in store layout, customer flow, and the willingness of customers to comply with social-distancing advice. To make matters even more difficult, we still have a limited understanding of how Covid-19 is transmitted. Given this uncertainty as well as the challenges of finding a “one-size-fits-all” set of guidelines, here we describe three general principles to help retailers implement social distancing. These guidelines are based on the fundamentals of operations management, our own research on traffic flow within stores, and the best information available about the transmission of the disease. We also highlight how these principles impact the bottom line of retailers who are struggling to keep afloat while keeping their customers and employees safe. Principle 1: Less Density, Faster Flow All experts agree that to lower the risk of virus transmission, retailers must lower the density of people within the store. The easiest way to do that is to limit the number of customers in the store at any one time. The following equation, known as “Little’s Law,” highlights a tradeoff between density and sales and provides a powerful tool to understand the impact of social distancing on retail stores: Throughput through the store (in customers per hour) = Number of customers in the store ÷ Time spent in the store (in hours) One way to increase throughput (and sales) is to increase the number of people in the store. To maintain social distancing, however, this requires additional floor space. Therefore we see Harrods expanding to remote locations and restaurants seating customers in parking lots and on closed streets. For space-constrained retailers, however, Little’s Law says that throughput will rise only if customers spend less time in the store. Therefore, these retailers should at this time focus on the efficiency of the shopping experience. While in more normal times retailers may have encouraged slower, browsing behavior, displays should now be designed to encourage faster customer decision-making. Retailers might consider changing the music played in the store, creating an atmosphere conducive to faster movement instead of relaxation and contemplation. Customers may also spend significant time waiting for help on the floor and waiting for check-out. Therefore, managers should be vigilant about carefully staffing the store to match customer demand: You want patrons to be shopping rather than waiting. Home Depot and Walmart have been particularly effective at this. Retailers should also ensure staff provide value-added services, such as lending expertise, so that customers can make better decisions more quickly. Principle 2: Manage Variability To maximize efficiency and throughput, a store would look like a well-run manufacturing line: Customers would arrive at designated times and shop at a designated pace in order to maintain social distancing. Alas, in real life, customers choose their own arrival times and pace, injecting variability into the system. One way of managing variability is to think of aisles in the store as highways, and interactions between customers as potential collisions. Our goal is to reduce the risk of a collision. Therefore, imagine a rural highway with two lanes. If everyone travels at close to the same speed in each direction, no two cars will pass each other, and two-car collisions will be rare. On the other hand, if half the cars drive slowly and the other half drive as if they are in one of the Fast & Furious movies, cars frequently pass each other, and risks rise dramatically. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share If you imagine customers walking down the aisles in a supermarket, you’ll see that similar principles apply. Our research shows that if all shoppers travel at a similar pace there will be fewer interactions; if there are a wide variety of paces then shoppers come close to each other much more often. Traffic engineers have long known that variability in speed increases the risk of collision, hence the need for reasonable speed limits, as well as minimum speeds that we see on some roads. For retail stores, there are a variety of methods for reducing pace variability. For example, many U.S. grocery chains have scheduled shopping periods that are exclusively for customers who are 60 years or older. These customers may shop at a similar pace, reducing the number of interactions. Another option is to encourage customers to make appointments: Shoe stores, farmer’s markets, swimming pools, and museums are all using this method to limit customer density and reduce variability. Another popular approach to keep customers from colliding is to implement one-way movement within stores. Our research shows that this can be an effective method for reducing the number of close interactions among customers. When in-store flow is similar to the highway described above, one-way movement produced only one-quarter of the customer close calls than for two-way movement. Managers may also want to design areas for shopping at different paces: one region for fast shopping for staples, another for pre-prepared baskets of goods, and a third for slower browsing. The general idea is to separate customers into groups who move at similar speeds. Principle 3: Use Nudges to Encourage Safe Behavior Among Customers and Employees Again, retail customers are not widgets on an assembly line, and a significant challenge for retailers is to modify customer behavior without diminishing the retail experience. Here, retailers should apply techniques from behavioral science. Rather than displaying text signs (“Please wear a mask”), stores should display posters of mask-wearing local customers and employees giving their thumbs-up. This provides “in-group” models to emphasize shared identity, establish connections, and promote norms among customers. Stores may also provide “nudges” to encourage behavior. For example, instead of arrows and signs to direct flow, build temporary displays and subtle barriers — disguised as promotions — to help customers move in the safest way. In general, the retail environment should be re-designed to make social distancing requirements clear, consistent, a natural extension of normal behavior, and a socially positive experience. These same nudges can also help retailers protect the health and safety of their employees. Now, more than ever, low-paid employees who are usually “hidden” in the store have become essential workers. Stores must provide protective equipment to employees, give them time to frequently disinfect their workspaces, and design retail space so that they maintain social distancing. Retailers should encourage their employees to become involved in designing and implementing social distancing policies. A store could provide both monetary and non-monetary incentives to employees for their ideas of how to improve the customer experience while keeping themselves and their customers safe. Their working conditions have become potentially dangerous, and these employees should be motivated, empowered and given the tools to create innovative solutions to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. Competing on Caring Of course, whether or not retail stores in a community can open should be determined by the prevalence of Covid-19 and the assessment of public health experts. Given that local conditions allow for opening, then by applying these principles — and showing they care about the health of their customers and employees — retailers can gain a competitive advantage. Consumers have shown loyalty to businesses that are putting safety first: From the Polar Cave Ice Cream Parlour on Cape Cod to Hugo’s Tacos in Los Angeles, businesses have received tremendous local support for their focus on safety. By following these three principles, retailers can adopt and implement social distancing practices that will keep their customers safe and ensure their future business.

Creativity How to Brainstorm — Remotely by Art Markman July 20, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary In the age of Covid-19, many of us are not working together in the same rooms as we were in the past, but we still need to generate ideas. There are both disadvantages and advantages to brainstorming remotely but you can make the most of the advantages to come up with new solutions. For example, because the problem-solving work will happen virtually, you can bring people from different parts of your organization — with different backgrounds and perspectives — who might not have been able to attend in person. So don’t start with a list of people you want involved in your session. Instead, identify the roles and expertise you want and then find people who fit that description. You can also slow down the process and make it asynchronous to avoid groupthink. Illustration by Joanna Ławniczak Leer en español We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. In the age of Covid-19, many of us are no longer working together in the same rooms — but we still need to generate ideas collaboratively. Fortunately, even in a remote environment there are several approaches that can help you solve complex problems effectively. Get a wide reach When you and others work together to generate a new solution to a problem, it’s important to remember that you’re doing so by taking advantage of the collected knowledge in the heads of the people involved in the process. The description of the problem serves as a cue for them to reach into their memory and retrieve related information. Determining who is involved in a brainstorm is therefore critical. Prior to the pandemic, in many organizations it was often hard to get a broad group of people together, because of their varying schedules and/or locations. But because our default was to have in-person meetings, we didn’t engage much with people who couldn’t be physically present as part of the idea-generation process. And we knew that hybrid meetings in which some people are present and some are online are generally a horrible experience for those attending remotely. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share One advantage of working remotely is that it’s now easier to bring in a broader group of participants. You have to do this carefully, though. Don’t start with a list of people you want involved in your brainstorming session. Instead, identify the roles and expertise you want, and then find people who fit that description. Ask your colleagues for recommendations of people you might not know who have relevant expertise. This will help you ensure that the group you bring together is more diverse, bringing a range of different backgrounds and perspectives to the problem-solving task. Take advantage of scheduling difficulties When people are working remotely, it can be difficult to get everyone scheduled for meetings at the same time, particularly if people are spread across time zones. For brainstorming, though, this can be a blessing. Because you actually don’t need the group to be together to come up with the best ideas. The groupthink theory shows that, during idea generation, individuals think differently about a problem if they work alone. But when you bring the group together to generate ideas, they tend to think alike, converging on a common solution. So start your brainstorming process by having each person generate potential solutions on their own, or perhaps have them work in small groups to think about possibilities. What you want to avoid is having the entire group start throwing out ideas at one another—which isn’t ideal in a remote environment anyway. Make sure everyone has had a chance to engage and work on the problem first. One way to do that is to have small groups capture their ideas in a document. A second is to have group members send their initial thoughts to you and to compile them before anyone starts to discuss them. After that initial stage, collect the solutions that have been generated and send them around to the group to build on them. Create a shared document with the preliminary ideas that everyone can edit, and invite people to further develop the initial proposals. When you read over the collection of ideas that have come in, you might also find that some of the proposals would benefit from the expertise of someone who is not already part of the group. One great thing about having this process extend out over time is that it gives you opportunities to engage new people who can bring valuable perspectives to the problem. Then, later in the process, you can bring the entire group together to discuss the most promising ideas and to reach a consensus about a small number of options to be considered further. Get specific There’s a lot of research showing that the more distant you are from something in time, space, or socially, the more abstractly you think about it. This is called construal-level theory. In a remote working environment, this means that you are often physically distant from the site of the problems you’re trying to solve and you therefore think about them more abstractly. Initially, that abstraction can be a good thing. If you start with a general representation of a problem, you increase the chances that you’ll be reminded of something that comes from another area of your expertise. Abstraction, in other words, can help you to find good analogies to provide insight. The danger, though, is that you will stay up in the clouds, failing to come up with specific solutions. And it’s hard for people to respond to and build on generic ideas. We’re going through this process right now at the University of Texas, as we plan for our fall semester during the Covid-19 pandemic. I’m leading the working group that is planning our academic offerings. For the past several weeks, we’ve created a specific scenario for not only the mix of classes that would meet in-person and online but also other factors such as the maximum occupancy of classrooms and the use of cloth masks by students, staff, and faculty. Each week, more than 250 people comment on the scenario and point out potential problems. Not surprisingly, that means it changes considerably. Because the scenario is specific, it leads people to think about issues that might not have come up if the discussion remained abstract. For example, we’ve had to grapple with finding spaces for students on campus who have a class in-person followed by one taking place online. Where will those students sit to attend the online class? It’s not clear that this problem would have surfaced if we weren’t envisioning the solution in detail. This process of iterative design requires that everyone be willing to treat the elements of that design as tentative from the start. If key people start to defend early decisions, then group members disengage. But, when people see that the specific scenario changes from one version to the next, then they remain committed to improving it. Given the amount of uncertainty every organization is facing, there will be no shortage of tough problems to solve over the coming months and years. So it’s important to get brainstorming right whether you’re online or in the same room together. The lessons we learn from brainstorming in the virtual setting will very likely serve us well when we’re face-to-face again.

Executive Summary Hiring diverse employees is a top priority for many organizations. And yet, many companies continuously fail to bring in a diverse workforce. The authors share research that suggests a simple method for overcoming hiring managers’ implicit biases: by partitioning candidates into different categories, companies can nudge reviewers to select more candidates from diverse backgrounds without reducing candidate quality. While this strategy does have some limitations, it offers an easy-to-implement method for significantly improving diversity in hiring. Nash Photos/Getty Images Leer en español “We are committed to a balanced gender distribution and value a variety of backgrounds and experiences among our employees.” “All applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” “Experience the difference. Make the difference!” Statements like these are common in job postings these days. Hiring diverse employees has become a critical goal for organizations around the world. And yet, many companies are failing to bring in a diverse workforce. One reason for continued lack of diversity is that even if similarly qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds apply for job openings, recruiters, because of implicit biases, gravitate toward candidates with identities that fit a stereotype (e.g., men in the technology industry). Our research identified an economic, convenient, and effective intervention to nudge recruiters to select more diverse candidates: partitioning candidates into different categories. Our research built on the partition dependence bias, which occurs when people have to choose multiple options out of many available options. When the options are grouped together based on a given dimension, people tend to think, “Let’s choose some from each category.” Therefore, people tend to choose some options from each group, ultimately choosing more diverse options. Our paper recently published in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes describes eight experiments in which we asked people to review job candidates’ profiles or resumes and choose a few candidates to interview. We either categorized the candidates along a diversity-related dimension (e.g., gender, ethnicity, nationality, or university) or just randomly interspersed them. In every experiment, we found that when candidates were categorized on a given dimension, people chose more diverse candidates on that dimension. For instance, we conducted a study with 121 experienced HR professionals who had an average of eight years of HR-related experience. We asked them to download a zipped folder containing resumes of 16 job applicants who graduated from one of four top universities. In one version of the study, the order of the resumes was random and did not vary by university. In the other version, the resumes from each school were contiguous in the folder (i.e., the files in the folder were sorted alphabetically). All HR managers were asked to select four candidates to interview. We found that when the resumes were randomly interspersed, 14% of managers chose candidates from all four universities, but this number more than doubled to 35% when the resumes were grouped together by university. We found similar results when we grouped candidates by gender, either by listing them contiguously or by using a paper clip to hold their printed resumes together. We found similar results when grouping candidates by ethnicity and nationality. In two of the experiments, we found that grouping candidates together increased the diversity of the selected candidates without reducing the quality of the selected candidates. For example, when male and female candidates differed in their mean college GPAs, grouping men and women candidates led managers to choose more gender-diverse candidates but did not affect the average GPA of those selected. What about cases in which a manager can select only a single candidate rather than multiple candidates? Here, we presented people with brief profiles of six job candidates, three of which were European American, one African American, one Latin American, and one Asian American. In one condition of the experiment, all candidates were listed on a separate line on the screen. In another condition, European American candidates were listed contiguously on a single line, but minority applicants were listed individually on separate lines. When majority candidates were grouped together but minority candidates were listed separately, 15% more people chose a minority candidate. To implement this strategy in the workplace, when sending resumes of applicants to hiring managers, organizations can put all resumes of candidates from well-represented backgrounds in sub-folders, but put resumes of candidates from under-represented backgrounds in the main folder (without grouping them into sub-folders). The relevant group-related information (e.g., gender) can be collected in the application form, and the application website can be programmed to automatically put candidates from different groups into different folders. The folders can be named “Batch 1,” “Batch 2,” etc. to avoid explicitly drawing attention to the grouping. One limitation of our nudging strategy is that if managers have strong biases against a particular group, then putting candidates from that group into a separate category has no effect on their hiring decisions — they’re still unlikely to select someone from that group. This nudge is only likely to work when managers don’t have strong biases against a particular group. Importantly, this intervention does not restrict managers in any way — they are absolutely free to choose whichever candidates that they want. It only draws managers’ attention to qualified minority candidates who might otherwise not attract their attention. Overall, if companies want to bring in more diverse talent, they need to change the way they hire new employees. Our research identifies a simple but effective tool — partitioning candidates into different categories — that can help organizations build more diverse workforces without restricting managers’ choices.

Race When a Brand Stands up for Racial Justice, Do People Buy It? by Geeta Menon and Tina Kiesler July 31, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary As protests against racial injustice sweep the country, U.S. corporations have pursued a wide variety of strategies to express their solidarity with the BLM movement. But these corporate actions often fall flat, appearing inauthentic to many consumers. What can corporations do to effectively and authentically support racial justice? The authors suggest a 4-part framework to help businesses better understand how different types of brand actions are likely to be perceived, based on whether the action is corporation-oriented or societally-oriented, as well as whether the action is undertaken more passively as an ally, or more proactively as an activist. Ultimately, the authors argue that the most authentic brand actions are those that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions despite potential risk to the corporation. Illustration by Gracia Lam Leer en español “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” -Angela Davis, American political activist, academic, author Recent protests demanding social justice and the affirmation of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement have provoked a flurry of activity among corporations as they drop brands that have racist connotations, reposition other brands with ambiguous to outright offensive racial implications, explicitly state their solidarity with the movement, and donate money to racial justice causes. But do consumers perceive these actions as authentic — especially when many of these companies are not Black owned and/or have a lackluster history of Black corporate leadership? And will these strategies result in long-term brand loyalty? What is brand authenticity? The literature defines brand authenticity as the extent to which consumers perceive a brand to be faithful to itself (continuity), faithful to its customers’ expectations for the brand to deliver on its promises (credibility), motivated by caring and responsibility towards the community (integrity), and reflecting values that consumers consider important (symbolism). Continuity and credibility are focused solely on the company and its customers, so these actions can be said to have a corporate orientation. Integrity and symbolism, on the other hand, are more focused on social issues outside the immediate scope of the company, and so these actions can be said to have a societal orientation. While both orientations are important and valid ways of expressing a brand’s authenticity, actions with a societal orientation are likely to be perceived as more authentic when it comes to social issues such as racial justice. In addition to orientation, brands can also choose to participate in these actions more actively or more passively. Specifically, they can choose to play a supportive non-racist role as an ally, indicating support for change with limited action, or they can choose to be an activist proactively involved in anti-racist actions and campaigns. As marketing professors who have studied consumer relationships with brands, we present a framework to help companies understand how authentic their brand actions will appear to consumers. By examining the intersection of orientation (corporate or societal) and type of participation (ally or activist) as presented in the table below, several brand actions of varied levels of authenticity emerge. Corporation-Oriented Actions: Atone: To make amends for past wrongdoings. These are corporation-oriented actions that companies take as allies. Essentially the bare minimum, these actions show that the corporation is at least aware of the need to act given past brand decisions that fly in the face of social justice. For example, if a company has products with negative racial connotations, such as Quaker Oats’ brand Aunt Jemima, it can choose to discontinue the brand. However, atoning for past sins with a mere withdrawal or a repackaging of a product, while important, is both fairly passive and self-focused, and as such, consumers likely to view these actions as low in authenticity. Allure: To proactively attract consumers. These are actions that are still corporation-oriented, but are more proactive than mere atonements: A corporation can be an activist and support a cause in a way that’s also directly in their self-interest. For example, Aerosoles announced it would support racial justice and combat discrimination by donating 10% of sales proceeds to the NAACP. This is a proactive approach to supporting an important social issue, but it is still self-serving, since it will also bring in more revenue as consumers seek to support the cause through their purchases. As such, consumers are likely to view these sorts of actions as low-medium in authenticity. (Note that this is different from another popular strategy in which brands donate 100% of their profits or a fixed dollar amount. In these cases, corporations do not benefit as directly from increased sales, so we would rate this strategy medium-high in perceived authenticity.) Societally-Oriented Actions: Acknowledge: To recognize a broad social issue. These actions are relatively passive, but they acknowledge social issues in a wider context than limited, corporation-oriented actions. As allies, corporations take societally-oriented actions in support of racial justice that might not lead them to profit directly, but are also unlikely to have a negative impact on the business. Netflix’s curation of BLM content, for example, is an action that supports a social mission and aligns with their business model, but is unlikely to drive significant new revenue. As such, consumers are likely to view the authenticity of this brand action as medium-high. Advocate: To actively support a cause or policy. To quote Ibram Kendi, author of How To Be An Antiracist, “To be anti-racist is a radical choice in the face of history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness.” To advocate for important social issues in a manner that will feel truly authentic to consumers, corporations must take an active, societally-oriented approach — one that may have even a potentially harmful impact on business goals. Nike is a great example of a company that took a stand without obvious self-interest: When Colin Kaepernick was abandoned by the NFL after kneeling during the national anthem, Nike made the risky decision to use him as the face of their Just Do It campaign. Despite widespread backlash, the company did end up seeing a surge in sales. Because of the corporate risk and the implications for broad racial justice, this campaign exemplifies a high-authenticity action. Consumer Perceptions of Authenticity of Racial Justice Brand Actions Orientation of Action Level of Participation Ally Supportive, non-racist Activist Actively anti-racist Corporation-oriented Actions focused on being faithful to the corporation (continuity) and to its consumers’ expectations (credibility). Atone Makes amends for past wrongdoings, such as product withdrawal (Aunt Jemima), name change (Unilever’s Fair & Lovely), and more inclusive product offerings (Band Aid). Allure Proactively supports racial justice while attracting more customers (Aerosoles donating 10% of sales proceeds to the NAACP) Perceived Authenticity: Low Perceived Authenticity: Low-medium Societally-oriented Actions focused on caring for the community (integrity) and reflecting consumers’ values (symbolism). Acknowledge Recognizes a broad social issue while neither hurting nor benefitting the corporation financially (Netflix curating BLM content). Advocate Proactively supports racial justice even at a risk to the corporation (Nike using Kaepernick as the face of their campaign). Perceived Authenticity: Medium-high Perceived Authenticity: High Source: Geeta Menon and Tina Kiesler Today’s consumers are vocal about social issues, and they are quick to take disingenuous corporations to task. A majority of Americans of all generations — 60% of the U.S. population — say that how a brand responds to racial justice protests will influence whether they buy or boycott the brand in the future. Additionally, 60% say brands should take steps to address the root causes of racial inequity and 57% say brands must educate the public. And Millennial and Gen Z consumers have expectations of brand authenticity that far exceed those of generations before them. These adult consumers are the most racially and ethnically diverse in American history, and they want corporations to stand for something beyond traditional consumer benefits and product quality. A June 2020 survey found that 69% of Millennial and Gen Z consumers think brands should be actively involved in the BLM movement. To connect with these younger consumers, brands need to take a stand against racial injustice in a way that is authentic to the corporation as well as their customers. Armed with this framework for brand actions outlined in this article, corporations can strategically assess the level of authenticity of different actions, enabling them both to better understand the impact of past actions and to better gauge how future planned actions are likely to be perceived. For brands that want to build a reputation as role models with a significant societal impact, the way forward is clear: The most authentic brand actions are ones that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions. These are actions that come with some risk, but they are also most likely to be rewarded with real consumer loyalty.

Webster July 30, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary While it’s easy to dismiss those who believe in conspiracy theories as a minority fringe, recent research shows that certain conditions can make anyone more susceptible: specifically, feeling a lack of control makes people much more likely to believe in these theories. Luckily, it’s possible to inoculate yourself — and others — from susceptibility to dangerous conspiracy theories. The authors offer four strategies based around the idea of cultivating a promotion-focused mindset to help you and those you lead cope with uncertainty and regain a sense of control.

This year, we have had to protect ourselves not only from a deadly virus, but also from some very dangerous ideas. Around the world, conspiracy theories have flourished, claiming that the virus is everything from a hostile attack, a hoax perpetuated by Big Pharma, or even a side effect of 5G networks. And while these theories may seem ridiculous, they can cause serious harm. Belief in these views undermines people’s trust in established organizations and tested, scientific solutions, and can lead to destructive behavior such as rejecting medical recommendations in favor of unproven treatments, or burning cell towers out of fear of 5G technology. While it’s easy to dismiss those who believe in these theories as a minority fringe, our research suggests that certain conditions can make anyone (and yes, we mean anyone) more susceptible. Specifically, we’ve found that feeling a lack of control makes people much more likely to believe in conspiracies — a revelation that’s particularly significant against the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis. As the global pandemic rages on, we have all lost liberties we once took for granted. Our freedom to travel and connect with others has been severely limited, and we all face uncertainty about the economy, our health, and when we will have our normal lives back. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Why does this loss of control make conspiracy theories so appealing? Research shows that when people experience loss of control, they tend to search for illusory patterns in their environment. These patterns are appealing because they reduce the environment’s randomness, uncertainty, and disorder — even if the certainty they offer is both ludicrous and unpleasant (such as governments or tech companies plotting to infect the world). Luckily, it’s possible to inoculate yourself — and others — from susceptibility to these dangerous conspiracy theories. Our work shows that how people think about control determines their vulnerability to these theories. Specifically, we found that individuals with a “promotion-focused” mindset (i.e., those who tend to focus on achieving their goals and aspirations) are more resistant to conspiracy theories than those with a “prevention-focused” mindset (i.e., those who focus on protecting what they already have), because the promotion focus on shaping their own futures involves a greater sense of control. We ran several studies to explore the relationship between control and openness to conspiracy theories. In the first, we surveyed 278 online participants who were randomly assigned three different writing assignments that we expected would shift their sense of control. In the promotion condition, participants wrote about a hope or goal; in prevention, they wrote about an obligation; and in the neutral condition, they were simply asked to write about the daily activities of an acquaintance. Participants then evaluated various conspiracies. We found that the participants who had been primed to adopt a promotion mindset were more likely to reject conspiracies than those in the neutral condition, whereas those in the prevention and the neutral conditions did not differ. A follow up study with 202 college students confirmed these priming effects again: the writing tasks shifted people’s feeling of control, which in turn reduced their susceptibility to conspiracy theories. Finally, we surveyed 202 soldiers on an army base — individuals who face significant uncertainty every day. Rather than shifting their mindsets through writing tasks, we surveyed them to assess their preexisting beliefs about control. We found that soldiers who reported more promotion-oriented beliefs and a greater sense of control over their lives (i.e., statements such as “what happens in the future depends on me”) were less likely to endorse conspiracy theories. So, if a greater sense of control makes people less vulnerable to conspiracy theories, what can we do in a time of widespread uncertainty to help ourselves — and those around us — feel that sense of structure and control without resorting to conspiracies? Our work suggests a few strategies. What you can do as an individual Understand what is — and isn’t — in your control. Research shows that understanding your locus of control can help avoid feelings of powerlessness. Try visualizing three concentric circles: the smallest is what you can control directly, the next is what you can influence, and the largest is what is out of your control. Which areas are commanding most of your attention? Direct your focus and effort to the areas where you can experience more control and influence. Embrace Complexity. Conspiracies are appealing because they offer the simplicity of a “single story,” in contrast to our messy, nuanced reality. While complex stories involving intricate interactions between people, their situations, and random chance often feel less satisfying, becoming more comfortable with complexity will prepare us to better understand and cope with the challenges of real life. Consider whether you tend to seek out sources of information (such as television, the internet, and your friends) which feel comforting, but might also make your single stories more extreme. What you can do as a leader Create structure. While micromanagement can be harmful, too many leaders end up “macromanaging:” providing their teams with too little order, structure, and norms. Especially in these chaotic times, leaders should strive to create structure by engaging in open conversation and setting clear expectations. Recent work from Gianpiero Petriglieri described this phenomenon as “holding,” or leaders’ responsibility to help their people interpret their environments and stay oriented through a crisis, thwarting these negative psychologies. Use promotion-focused language. Emphasize the things that people do have control over, and empower them to proactively influence their own situations. For example, some leaders have been reluctant to mandate masks (despite definitive scientific evidence that they reduce the transmission of Covid-19) because these mandates can feel like a threat to people’s freedom. A more effective approach might be to reframe masks as a source of freedom and control, since wearing a mask empowers people to more safely interact with others (at appropriate social distance) and return to something that resembles normalcy. While it can be tempting to simply force people to follow scientific or common-sense guidelines, messages which make people feel powerless and take away their choices often backfire, unintentionally weakening their sense of control and make conspiracies more appealing. The Covid-19 crisis has limited our freedom to choose, move, and interact in our environments — freedoms that many of us have long taken for granted — and we must prepare for the psychological distress that inevitably results from this loss of control. While there’s no avoiding this loss, we can inoculate ourselves and our people against the threat of conspiracy theories by helping them to cope with uncertainty and regain a sense of control — wherever they can.

Here’s How to Stymie Transmission of Covid-19. by Scott E. Page July 28, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary As businesses begin to re-open offices, they must take steps to contain the spread of the Coronavirus. Doing so will require more than just creating distance and barriers between people. It will require an understanding of the networks of people and the networks of people and objects they interact with. The virus can be transmitted along two types of paths, a person-to-person one, and a person-to-object or place-to person one. Simply reducing the number of paths does not maximize risk reduction. Two companies may reduce the same number of transmission paths but one will be safer if it removes what are called bridging links. Those are people or objects that connect separate network clusters. Imagine Bob works on the the third floor but habitually goes to the fourth floor to get coffee. He could be a bridging link between the third floor network cluster and fourth floor network cluster. Companies can run a simple survey and observation over a couple of days or part of their office to map out a part of their network and aim to eliminate bridging links. One small sample could inform a larger office’s broader strategy for disrupting viral pathways. Yuichiro Chino/Getty Images Leer en español We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers.

As they do, the safety of their employees and customers — from both real and perceived risks — have become paramount concerns. Concerns over catching and spreading the coronavirus mean that the roughly 40% of workers able to work from home likely will continue to do so. But for the majority of workers, a physical return looms in at least some capacity. Work that requires physical interactions — construction, retail, food service, entertainment, sports, medical care, education, and salons – will require significant changes to the physical environment and individual behaviors. In designing those changes, leaders should aim for a path-breaking strategy: creating behavioral protocols and built environments that break transmission paths. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share While social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, and wiping down surfaces make those workplaces safer, limiting the spread of the virus depends on identifying and disrupting systems of connections. It will require mapping out transmission networks and breaking key links in those networks, a strategy quite similar to the one the intelligence community has long used to break up illegal networks. In other words, effective re-opening strategies focus on breaking up connecting paths rather than just reducing number of connections. Two workplaces might have equal numbers of potential connections through which the virus can spread; but if one workplace disrupts more pathways, it will be doing more to stop the spread of the virus. The logic works as follows: All networks are made up of nodes or points and connections between them. In the case of the virus, a connection is a transmission pathway between points. That path could be airborne respiratory droplets or some surface. Airborne transmission occurs through face to face interactions or, in some cases, from droplets lingering in the air. The masks and barriers we’ve all become accustomed to are part of the strategy to break this path. Surface, or fomite, transmission occurs when an object’s surface has been touched many times by many people who transmit the virus to the object, which is then transmitted again to another person touching that surface, be it a door handle, bathroom keys, a chair back, whiteboard markers, conference room desks, the steering wheel on a forklift, or any number of others. Both networks matter and must be understood. The first, a person-to-person (P2P) network, maps out which people physically interact with whom. It might seem that the key is to disconnect as many people from each other as possible, but that’s not as important as disconnecting key paths for the virus. For example, Barron Industries, a casting foundry in Oxford, Michigan, was required to remain open as a government supplier. It worked with the Economic Growth Institute and constructed a person to person network. That exercise revealed that certain individuals connected otherwise disconnected groups. In network theory, these are known as bridging links. In a pandemic, they can carry infection from one group to another, which is more damaging than it being carried from one person to another within a contained network. Therefore, breaking these paths by making bridging links virtual prevents widespread contagion. The second network, a person-object/place-person (POP) network connects people to objects (or places) and then those objects back to people. Drawing a POP network requires three simple steps: Make a list of people and a list of objects Draw edges connecting people to the objects that they touch or locations they visit Draw a line between two people if they touch a common object or visit a common location The diagram below shows a POP network for seven employees and five objects. The edges have been colored so as to identify which object the two people touch. The individuals identified as C, D, and E are connected because they all visit the coffee machine. The POP network reveals a path breaking strategy: remove the whiteboard. Doing so disconnects the network. While the coffee machine and the whiteboard each created the same number of connections, the whiteboard was far more important to the network as it created multiple bridges. Reducing the number of people who touch an object may also save time and costs. An even more powerful path breaking strategies overlays the POP network and the person-to-person network. The figure below shows a disconnected P2P network and a disconnected POP network, then combines them as a full transmission network. Though each intervention looks strong on its own, together the two successful interventions fail as a system. Node A bridges the two, creating clear transmission paths that need to be broken even further. If your workplace has just a few employees, you can construct the two networks with a survey followed by a day or two of observation. The resulting networks might look similar to the ones in the figure. In larger workplace, you can build up the networks by distinguishing between local and distance spaces. Ask people who they interact with in their immediate vicinities and who from more distant locations. If multiple people from different locations interact in close proximity with a common person — maybe someone who assigns rooms or hands out mail, then those connections need to be made virtual. Do the same for objects and places. You may find that people on different floors use a common stairwell creating a pathway between isolated floors. Far better, if you have two stairways for a three story building, you can assign each upper floor a separate stairway. You break the path. The key takeaway is that you need not construct full networks in order to identify people or locations that create bridging links that can become super-spreaders. Successful strategies look beyond reducing the number of connections and think about disrupting the networks those connections create. While it is true that each intervention that reduces contact — be it contactless pizza pedestals, paper menus, or plexiglass barriers — will help, the most effective re-opening strategies will leverage path breaking ideas. The process of developing those strategies requires that you identify the networks between people and people and objects in your workplace and then start disrupting viral pathways.

Managing people Reward Your Employees — Without Breaking the Bank by Sanjiv Das August 07, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary Due to the current economic slowdown, many companies are finding themselves unable to afford large annual bonuses. What can organizations do to reward top performers and keep morale high while limiting spending? The author, a CEO with one the largest housing specialty lenders in the U.S., discusses the advantage of smaller-scale, more frequent spot bonuses for improving employee satisfaction and performance. Based on scientific research and the author’s own experience, he suggests that spot bonuses offer a simple yet effective mechanism for rewarding employees during the pandemic. moodboard/Getty Images Leer en español As the ongoing public health crisis has metastasized into an economic slowdown, it’s difficult for many corporations to retain and reward their people. Many firms aren’t in the position to give their employees large annual bonuses. As the former CEO of CitiMortgage and now the CEO of Caliber Home Loans, I have seen how spot bonuses can be an effective alternative: We recently paid spot bonuses to almost all our employees to reward them for their diligent work in a tumultuous year. Indeed, companies can use a spot bonus like a scalpel to stimulate feelings of satisfaction among employees, incentivize group behaviors, and build a stronger sense of solidarity. A spot bonus is typically paid “on the spot” to individuals or a group of employees (and sometimes an organization’s entire workforce) for a specific behavior, action, or result. Because of their targeted nature, they tend to be a smaller amount of money than the annual incentive reward. In my experience, they typically range from a couple hundred dollars to a few thousand. According to research done by PayScale in 2018, these are the second most commonly used form of variable pay, tied with employee referral bonuses, after annual individual bonuses. There are many reasons you should consider using this type of compensation at your organization. First, a spot bonus can make your employees feel more satisfied — and more frequently. There’s a scientific basis to this point: In a 2001 study, neuroscientists discovered that the anticipation of monetary rewards generates a significant amount of activation in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the “reward circuitry” of the brain. In the same study, participants self-reported that they felt happier at the prospect of monetary gain. If your goal is to reward employees, then try engaging their reward circuitry more often. Instead of waiting an entire year to pay a bonus, consider introducing bonuses that employees can anticipate more frequently, such as recurring spot bonuses which are based on individual performance but also tied to the performance of the company. Not only will it more regularly stimulate “satisfied” brain activity among employees, but it will also help form a mental association between the results of the firm and individual performance. This may create more work for HR or your financial group, but your leadership team could determine the spot bonus pool for the year in advance and empower managers to allocate them accordingly throughout the year. Second, a spot bonus may improve team performance, especially if recipients are encouraged to spend this money on others. Because of the pandemic, many people are working longer hours and often doing so in isolation. Yet there is an increasing amount of research that indicates that interpersonal relationships can serve as a source of satisfaction at work. In a 2013 study, salespeople at a pharmaceutical company were divided into groups, those who received personal bonuses and those who got prosocial bonuses who were encouraged to spend these bonuses on others. Those who received prosocial bonuses spent more money buying gifts for each other like lunches for colleagues. These teams outperformed those that didn’t receive the prosocial bonuses. “When organizations give employees the opportunity to spend money on others … both the employees and the company can benefit, with increased happiness and job satisfaction and even improved team performance,” conclude the authors of the study. These findings suggest that you could pay prosocial spot bonuses that are meant to be gifted, in an effort to boost performance. Third, a spot bonus is an opportunity to demonstrate your organization’s priorities. Don’t just make it about the money. It’s not enough to only remit payments. You also have to explain how these bonuses are being paid because the firm is meeting its objectives. When my firm paid spot bonuses to almost all of our employees last year, we held an offsite in which we addressed the state of our business, described various transformation initiatives that were currently underway, and answered employee questions. Giving such a bonus presents an opportunity because you will have everyone’s attention, and they’re more likely to be open to what you and other leaders have to say. This is the time to share your vision, address queries, and inspire action. In this period of pandemic and recession, a spot bonus is a way to help employees through difficult times, as well as boost performance and morale.

Race When a Brand Stands up for Racial Justice, Do People Buy It? by Geeta Menon and Tina Kiesler July 31, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary As protests against racial injustice sweep the country, U.S. corporations have pursued a wide variety of strategies to express their solidarity with the BLM movement. But these corporate actions often fall flat, appearing inauthentic to many consumers. What can corporations do to effectively and authentically support racial justice? The authors suggest a 4-part framework to help businesses better understand how different types of brand actions are likely to be perceived, based on whether the action is corporation-oriented or societally-oriented, as well as whether the action is undertaken more passively as an ally, or more proactively as an activist. Ultimately, the authors argue that the most authentic brand actions are those that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions despite potential risk to the corporation. Illustration by Gracia Lam Leer en español “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” -Angela Davis, American political activist, academic, author Recent protests demanding social justice and the affirmation of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement have provoked a flurry of activity among corporations as they drop brands that have racist connotations, reposition other brands with ambiguous to outright offensive racial implications, explicitly state their solidarity with the movement, and donate money to racial justice causes. But do consumers perceive these actions as authentic — especially when many of these companies are not Black owned and/or have a lackluster history of Black corporate leadership? And will these strategies result in long-term brand loyalty? What is brand authenticity? The literature defines brand authenticity as the extent to which consumers perceive a brand to be faithful to itself (continuity), faithful to its customers’ expectations for the brand to deliver on its promises (credibility), motivated by caring and responsibility towards the community (integrity), and reflecting values that consumers consider important (symbolism). Continuity and credibility are focused solely on the company and its customers, so these actions can be said to have a corporate orientation. Integrity and symbolism, on the other hand, are more focused on social issues outside the immediate scope of the company, and so these actions can be said to have a societal orientation. While both orientations are important and valid ways of expressing a brand’s authenticity, actions with a societal orientation are likely to be perceived as more authentic when it comes to social issues such as racial justice. In addition to orientation, brands can also choose to participate in these actions more actively or more passively. Specifically, they can choose to play a supportive non-racist role as an ally, indicating support for change with limited action, or they can choose to be an activist proactively involved in anti-racist actions and campaigns. As marketing professors who have studied consumer relationships with brands, we present a framework to help companies understand how authentic their brand actions will appear to consumers. By examining the intersection of orientation (corporate or societal) and type of participation (ally or activist) as presented in the table below, several brand actions of varied levels of authenticity emerge. Corporation-Oriented Actions: Atone: To make amends for past wrongdoings. These are corporation-oriented actions that companies take as allies. Essentially the bare minimum, these actions show that the corporation is at least aware of the need to act given past brand decisions that fly in the face of social justice. For example, if a company has products with negative racial connotations, such as Quaker Oats’ brand Aunt Jemima, it can choose to discontinue the brand. However, atoning for past sins with a mere withdrawal or a repackaging of a product, while important, is both fairly passive and self-focused, and as such, consumers likely to view these actions as low in authenticity. Allure: To proactively attract consumers. These are actions that are still corporation-oriented, but are more proactive than mere atonements: A corporation can be an activist and support a cause in a way that’s also directly in their self-interest. For example, Aerosoles announced it would support racial justice and combat discrimination by donating 10% of sales proceeds to the NAACP. This is a proactive approach to supporting an important social issue, but it is still self-serving, since it will also bring in more revenue as consumers seek to support the cause through their purchases. As such, consumers are likely to view these sorts of actions as low-medium in authenticity. (Note that this is different from another popular strategy in which brands donate 100% of their profits or a fixed dollar amount. In these cases, corporations do not benefit as directly from increased sales, so we would rate this strategy medium-high in perceived authenticity.) Societally-Oriented Actions: Acknowledge: To recognize a broad social issue. These actions are relatively passive, but they acknowledge social issues in a wider context than limited, corporation-oriented actions. As allies, corporations take societally-oriented actions in support of racial justice that might not lead them to profit directly, but are also unlikely to have a negative impact on the business. Netflix’s curation of BLM content, for example, is an action that supports a social mission and aligns with their business model, but is unlikely to drive significant new revenue. As such, consumers are likely to view the authenticity of this brand action as medium-high. Advocate: To actively support a cause or policy. To quote Ibram Kendi, author of How To Be An Antiracist, “To be anti-racist is a radical choice in the face of history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness.” To advocate for important social issues in a manner that will feel truly authentic to consumers, corporations must take an active, societally-oriented approach — one that may have even a potentially harmful impact on business goals. Nike is a great example of a company that took a stand without obvious self-interest: When Colin Kaepernick was abandoned by the NFL after kneeling during the national anthem, Nike made the risky decision to use him as the face of their Just Do It campaign. Despite widespread backlash, the company did end up seeing a surge in sales. Because of the corporate risk and the implications for broad racial justice, this campaign exemplifies a high-authenticity action. Consumer Perceptions of Authenticity of Racial Justice Brand Actions Orientation of Action Level of Participation Ally Supportive, non-racist Activist Actively anti-racist Corporation-oriented Actions focused on being faithful to the corporation (continuity) and to its consumers’ expectations (credibility). Atone Makes amends for past wrongdoings, such as product withdrawal (Aunt Jemima), name change (Unilever’s Fair & Lovely), and more inclusive product offerings (Band Aid). Allure Proactively supports racial justice while attracting more customers (Aerosoles donating 10% of sales proceeds to the NAACP) Perceived Authenticity: Low Perceived Authenticity: Low-medium Societally-oriented Actions focused on caring for the community (integrity) and reflecting consumers’ values (symbolism). Acknowledge Recognizes a broad social issue while neither hurting nor benefitting the corporation financially (Netflix curating BLM content). Advocate Proactively supports racial justice even at a risk to the corporation (Nike using Kaepernick as the face of their campaign). Perceived Authenticity: Medium-high Perceived Authenticity: High Source: Geeta Menon and Tina Kiesler Today’s consumers are vocal about social issues, and they are quick to take disingenuous corporations to task. A majority of Americans of all generations — 60% of the U.S. population — say that how a brand responds to racial justice protests will influence whether they buy or boycott the brand in the future. Additionally, 60% say brands should take steps to address the root causes of racial inequity and 57% say brands must educate the public. And Millennial and Gen Z consumers have expectations of brand authenticity that far exceed those of generations before them. These adult consumers are the most racially and ethnically diverse in American history, and they want corporations to stand for something beyond traditional consumer benefits and product quality. A June 2020 survey found that 69% of Millennial and Gen Z consumers think brands should be actively involved in the BLM movement. To connect with these younger consumers, brands need to take a stand against racial injustice in a way that is authentic to the corporation as well as their customers. Armed with this framework for brand actions outlined in this article, corporations can strategically assess the level of authenticity of different actions, enabling them both to better understand the impact of past actions and to better gauge how future planned actions are likely to be perceived. For brands that want to build a reputation as role models with a significant societal impact, the way forward is clear: The most authentic brand actions are ones that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions. These are actions that come with some risk, but they are also most likely to be rewarded with real consumer loyalty.

Executive Summary While it’s easy to dismiss those who believe in conspiracy theories as a minority fringe, recent research shows that certain conditions can make anyone more susceptible: specifically, feeling a lack of control makes people much more likely to believe in these theories. Luckily, it’s possible to inoculate yourself — and others — from susceptibility to dangerous conspiracy theories. The authors offer four strategies based around the idea of cultivating a promotion-focused mindset to help you and those you lead cope with uncertainty and regain a sense of control.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. This year, we have had to protect ourselves not only from a deadly virus, but also from some very dangerous ideas. Around the world, conspiracy theories have flourished, claiming that the virus is everything from a hostile attack, a hoax perpetuated by Big Pharma, or even a side effect of 5G networks. And while these theories may seem ridiculous, they can cause serious harm. Belief in these views undermines people’s trust in established organizations and tested, scientific solutions, and can lead to destructive behavior such as rejecting medical recommendations in favor of unproven treatments, or burning cell towers out of fear of 5G technology. While it’s easy to dismiss those who believe in these theories as a minority fringe, our research suggests that certain conditions can make anyone (and yes, we mean anyone) more susceptible. Specifically, we’ve found that feeling a lack of control makes people much more likely to believe in conspiracies — a revelation that’s particularly significant against the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis. As the global pandemic rages on, we have all lost liberties we once took for granted. Our freedom to travel and connect with others has been severely limited, and we all face uncertainty about the economy, our health, and when we will have our normal lives back. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Why does this loss of control make conspiracy theories so appealing? Research shows that when people experience loss of control, they tend to search for illusory patterns in their environment. These patterns are appealing because they reduce the environment’s randomness, uncertainty, and disorder — even if the certainty they offer is both ludicrous and unpleasant (such as governments or tech companies plotting to infect the world). Luckily, it’s possible to inoculate yourself — and others — from susceptibility to these dangerous conspiracy theories. Our work shows that how people think about control determines their vulnerability to these theories. Specifically, we found that individuals with a “promotion-focused” mindset (i.e., those who tend to focus on achieving their goals and aspirations) are more resistant to conspiracy theories than those with a “prevention-focused” mindset (i.e., those who focus on protecting what they already have), because the promotion focus on shaping their own futures involves a greater sense of control. We ran several studies to explore the relationship between control and openness to conspiracy theories. In the first, we surveyed 278 online participants who were randomly assigned three different writing assignments that we expected would shift their sense of control. In the promotion condition, participants wrote about a hope or goal; in prevention, they wrote about an obligation; and in the neutral condition, they were simply asked to write about the daily activities of an acquaintance. Participants then evaluated various conspiracies. We found that the participants who had been primed to adopt a promotion mindset were more likely to reject conspiracies than those in the neutral condition, whereas those in the prevention and the neutral conditions did not differ. A follow up study with 202 college students confirmed these priming effects again: the writing tasks shifted people’s feeling of control, which in turn reduced their susceptibility to conspiracy theories. Finally, we surveyed 202 soldiers on an army base — individuals who face significant uncertainty every day. Rather than shifting their mindsets through writing tasks, we surveyed them to assess their preexisting beliefs about control. We found that soldiers who reported more promotion-oriented beliefs and a greater sense of control over their lives (i.e., statements such as “what happens in the future depends on me”) were less likely to endorse conspiracy theories. So, if a greater sense of control makes people less vulnerable to conspiracy theories, what can we do in a time of widespread uncertainty to help ourselves — and those around us — feel that sense of structure and control without resorting to conspiracies? Our work suggests a few strategies. What you can do as an individual Understand what is — and isn’t — in your control. Research shows that understanding your locus of control can help avoid feelings of powerlessness. Try visualizing three concentric circles: the smallest is what you can control directly, the next is what you can influence, and the largest is what is out of your control. Which areas are commanding most of your attention? Direct your focus and effort to the areas where you can experience more control and influence. Embrace Complexity. Conspiracies are appealing because they offer the simplicity of a “single story,” in contrast to our messy, nuanced reality. While complex stories involving intricate interactions between people, their situations, and random chance often feel less satisfying, becoming more comfortable with complexity will prepare us to better understand and cope with the challenges of real life. Consider whether you tend to seek out sources of information (such as television, the internet, and your friends) which feel comforting, but might also make your single stories more extreme. What you can do as a leader Create structure. While micromanagement can be harmful, too many leaders end up “macromanaging:” providing their teams with too little order, structure, and norms. Especially in these chaotic times, leaders should strive to create structure by engaging in open conversation and setting clear expectations. Recent work from Gianpiero Petriglieri described this phenomenon as “holding,” or leaders’ responsibility to help their people interpret their environments and stay oriented through a crisis, thwarting these negative psychologies. Use promotion-focused language. Emphasize the things that people do have control over, and empower them to proactively influence their own situations. For example, some leaders have been reluctant to mandate masks (despite definitive scientific evidence that they reduce the transmission of Covid-19) because these mandates can feel like a threat to people’s freedom. A more effective approach might be to reframe masks as a source of freedom and control, since wearing a mask empowers people to more safely interact with others (at appropriate social distance) and return to something that resembles normalcy. While it can be tempting to simply force people to follow scientific or common-sense guidelines, messages which make people feel powerless and take away their choices often backfire, unintentionally weakening their sense of control and make conspiracies more appealing. The Covid-19 crisis has limited our freedom to choose, move, and interact in our environments — freedoms that many of us have long taken for granted — and we must prepare for the psychological distress that inevitably results from this loss of control. While there’s no avoiding this loss, we can inoculate ourselves and our people against the threat of conspiracy theories by helping them to cope with uncertainty and regain a sense of control — wherever they can.

Managing yourself Recent Grads Are Drowning in Uncertainty. Here’s How to Stay Afloat. by Meg Jay August 13, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary There are nearly fifty million twentysomethings in the United States, most of whom are living with a staggering, unprecedented amount of uncertainty. And now, millions of new would-be workers have graduated, without the pomp and circumstance, into a global pandemic and likely recession. Research shows that, rather than long for certainties that do not exist, the best way to adapt to uncertainty is to change how we think about it — and to find a way to keep moving. If you’re feeling stuck, you should try to avoid mental time-travel, build identity capital, resist reassurance, forget regret, and build healthy habits. Henrik Sorensen/Getty Images Leer en español There are nearly fifty million twentysomethings in the United States, most of whom are living with a staggering, unprecedented amount of uncertainty. Most have no idea where they will work or where they will live in five years. They don’t know if they are a day or a decade away from a promotion, or when they will be able to pay their bills. And now, millions of new would-be workers have graduated, without the pomp and circumstance, into a global pandemic and recession. As a psychologist who specializes in twentysomethings, I hear every day from young workers who feel overwhelmed because of the unknowns in their lives. If you feel this way too, you are far from alone. Research shows that, rather than long for certainties that do not exist, the best way to adapt to uncertainty is to change how we think about it — and to find a way to keep moving. Here are some suggestions. Avoid Time Traveling. When the future feels uncertain, we tend to spend a lot of time thinking about it. Yet, your twenties are no time for what psychologists call “time traveling,” or mentally transporting yourself to next month or next year. They are a good time to make plans for the future and to work toward those plans. But there is a difference between preparing for the future and pretending it is already here. There is a Tibetan proverb that goes like this: “Take care of the minutes and the years will take care of themselves.” The best way to do something about the there-and-then is to do something in the here-and-now. If you catch yourself worrying about what life will look like at 25 or 35, figure out what that means you need to get going on today. It could be as simple as writing a cover letter, scrolling job listings, or reaching out to someone in your network that could help you get where you want to go. Move from Identity Crisis to Identity Capital. Identity capital is your collection of personal assets. It is the skills and experiences and qualities that make you who you are…so far. The average young worker has eight jobs by the age of thirty. Your twenties, then, are less about finding that one-and-only “forever job” than they are about investing in yourself along the way. And most of you will need to find a job — any job — to stay afloat financially. Whatever you do, do something that adds value to who you are. “Never have a blank year,” a mentor told me once as I headed out on maternity leave. What she meant was that, even if it feels like your future is on hold due to unusual circumstances, do something you can put on your resume. Whether it’s an online financial literacy course, or a tech certification, or studying for the GMAT, good jobs aren’t the only way to build identity capital. Shift from “What if” to “What is.” The most common thinking error in uncertain situations is catastrophic thinking. It’s that worst-case-scenario thinking one of my clients calls being “a what if-er.” What if I never find a job? What if I get fired? What if my life doesn’t work out? Rather than letting your emotions run away with “What if,” slow down and practice evidence-based thinking or “What is.” Write down the evidence for — and against — this catastrophe you’re imagining. Chances are that, when you reason with yourself, you’ll see your situation is not as dire as you imagined. Be willing to ask yourself, “What is the plan should this fear come true?” If you’re worried about losing your job, make note of what you will do if that comes to pass. Facing our fears makes them less powerful. It shows us that even our biggest problems can be gotten through. Resist Reassurance Seeking. Reassurance is a coping mechanism so prevalent — and problematic — that a national conference for psychologists included a session devoted to working with “reassurance junkies.” You might be a reassurance junkie if you call your parents a dozen times a day about what you should do with your life. Or maybe you text your therapist — again and again — wondering if your job or your relationship will last. When I reassure clients they quickly — and more anxiously — return for more; it’s like a drug with a short half life. So, rather than approaching and re-approaching bosses or friends or partners for guarantees they cannot (or should not) give, shore up your own self-assurance. Think of a tough situation you faced in the past. Remind yourself of what you did to get through. You’ll gain more confidence this way and begin to see yourself — and not just other people — as capable and strong. Forget Regret. Regret is the feeling of dissatisfaction that occurs when we imagine the choice we made is worse than the one we did not. Yet, we can never know what would have happened if life played out differently. Research suggests that embracing this truth can stave off regret. So get going and travel lighter without the fear of regret. If you do find yourself weighted down with a particular regret, name what it is you think you missed out on. Work-life balance? A better boss? Stock options? Rather than looking backward at what you did not get, look forward and use regret as information about what you would like to set yourself up for next. Regret can lead to quitting, and your twenties are no time to give up. Get Healthier (and Happier). Your brain and your personality change more in your twenties than at any other time in adulthood. Whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it by building good habits. Yes, mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression and substance abuse, tend to emerge in one’s twenties (often in response to uncertainty). But they also tend to improve in one’s twenties — with effort. One of my clients started running to manage her mood. Another is using COVID lockdowns as a time to get sober. Another is looking at Instagram less and sleeping more. Yet another is getting ahead on her hobby while she finds it difficult to get ahead at work. Yes, twentysomethings are happier when they make strides at work — but twentysomethings who are happy and healthy outside of the office are better workers, too. Think of your life as a twentysomething as a plane just after takeoff. It’s a time when a small change in course can make a big difference in terms of where you end up. Yes, it is an up-in-the-air and turbulent time. But, if you figure out how to navigate, even a little bit at a time, you can get further, faster than at any other time in life.

Difficult conversations 4 Conversations Leaders in the #MeToo Era Should Be Ready For by Sarah Beaulieu August 12, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary As more and more people share their experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace, leaders must be prepared to navigate several kinds of difficult conversations with their teams. Specifically, leaders should consider how they will respond if an employee discloses an incident, how they will intervene if they see inappropriate behavior taking place at work, how they will proactively build a culture of respect, and how they will respond if an employee shares a past experience of harassment. In the #MeToo era, good leadership means not just responding to problems when they occur, but actively initiating the uncomfortable conversations that are essential to build a safe organization. Illustration by Lisa Tegtmeier Leer en español The #MeToo movement broke the silence on sexual harassment in the workplace, inspiring leaders in every industry to reckon with their organizations’ culture — and their own behavior — to build a work environment that’s safe and supportive for everyone. And as more and more people open up about their experiences with harassment and abuse, leaders can pretty much guarantee that they’ll find themselves dealing with these issues at one point or another. But good leadership is not just about responding to incidents when they occur. It’s also about being prepared to navigate the difficult conversations that help prevent sexual harassment in the first place. The more you practice and prepare for these uncomfortable conversations, the more likely you are to respond in ways that support your team and make your organization a positive place to work. 1. The disclosure conversation Both culturally and legally, a disclosure is the ultimate high-stakes conversation. Without formal reports of harassment, companies cannot hold perpetrators accountable and prevent them from continuing to behave inappropriately. However, there are real reasons why employees are reluctant to report, including a fear of not being believed, fear of retaliation, and fear of too small or too big a response. Each time a disclosure is handled with empathy and respect, it helps to rebuild organizational trust. Consider these four steps: Express empathy. It takes a lot of guts to report sexual harassment. Thank the person for sharing the information with you and validate their emotional response. You can acknowledge their feelings while still ensuring a fair process for deciding what to do next. Assess safety. Does the person feel emotionally and physically safe? Do they have the ability to stay safe until the next step in the process? If physical safety is an issue, follow your workplace guidelines and create a safety plan. If the person needs emotional support, ask whether they have someone to call, offer an internal resource such as an EAP, and/or recommend an external hotline. Give them their power back. Even if you are required to report the incident to human resources, offer the person whatever options are available to them. For example, the employee may be able to choose who will speak to human resources first, or whether the report will be made by email or by phone. Even a small choice can feel empowering for someone who has experienced loss of control. Know your own policies, compliance advice and reporting guidelines. If you know these policies cold, it will be easier to adhere to them while still expressing empathy and sounding human. Finally, recognize that a disclosure conversation is NOT a human resources investigation. Most likely, it’s the first of many conversations required to address a sexual harassment incident. There will be time for additional conversations, so focus your response to the initial disclosure on conveying deep empathy and setting up future conversations for success. 2. The intervention conversation There is a spectrum of problematic behavior in the workplace, ranging from minor red flags to obvious harassment or even violence. The earlier you intervene, the better positioned you will be to prevent major problems. Many leaders confuse an intervention conversation with a call-out conversation, which is the most direct form of intervention. The purpose of an intervention conversation is to restore safety and promote a culture of respect. Imagine attending a charity dinner on behalf of your company. A young staff member from the charity is seated at your table. One of your colleagues, a peer, is leaning pretty close to her and commenting on her appearance and attire. She keeps inching her chair away from him, and he just continues moving closer and closer. What do you do? What do you say? There are four strategies you can employ when you witness a situation that seems unsafe or disrespectful: Direct: Say something directly to your colleague, such as, “I guess you missed the memo about appropriate conversations.” If you prefer a less direct approach, you could also make a pointed joke about his inappropriate behavior, or request that he switch seats with you. Distract: You can create a distraction that interrupts the behavior. For example, ask the staff member to introduce you to her boss at another table, or offer to introduce her to one of your colleagues. Delegate: Invite someone who has a closer relationship with either person to participate in the intervention. For example, you can ask the person sitting next to you if they also find the situation inappropriate, or text the staff person’s boss to ask for their assistance. Defer: If all else fails, you can approach the young staff member after the fact, check if she is okay, and make sure she has a safe way home. Let me be clear. None of these options will feel comfortable. And all come with some risk of one or both of your colleagues getting upset. But risking a minor conflict to ensure the safety of someone with less power than you is the responsibility of a strong leader. It’s also important to note that an overzealous or inappropriate intervention runs the risk of making the situation more volatile or unsafe, so you should do your best to consider how your actions will make them feel before rushing to their defense. 3. The culture conversation As a leader, it’s up to you to proactively signal that safety and respect are important to the culture you want to build. When leaders wait until an incident takes place to discuss sexual harassment with their teams, they often come across sounding opaque or defensive. Skilled leaders find ways to broach the topic of sexual harassment – and its impact on the team – on a regular basis. Do you ever talk about sexual harassment at your all-hands meetings? Have you asked human resources to brief the executive team on your current policies and reporting structures? Have you asked sales managers what they are doing to prevent sexual harassment with clients or customers? Does your company participate in sexual assault awareness month? Don’t wait for people who are harassed – or at risk for harassment – to break the ice for you. By broaching this topic on a regular basis, you signal to employees that building a safe culture is important to you, and you make it significantly easier for people to feel comfortable coming forward to you if an issue does arise. 4. The support conversation Disclosures aren’t always about incidents that happened at work. Given that one in four women, one in six men and one in two transgender employees will experience sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime, this topic may arise in the course of your working relationships. When someone shares something like this from their past, it’s a moment to express empathy by saying something like, “I appreciate you trusting me enough to tell me,” or “I’m sorry that happened to you.” It’s also worth checking in on their safety and support network. You can simply ask, “Are you receiving the help and support you need right now?” Or, “Do you have people in your life that you can talk to about this?” Finally, while it’s not your place to provide counseling to an employee, it’s valuable to offer to check in at a specific time in the future – and follow through. Doing so demonstrates that you take their disclosure seriously and value your relationship with them. And if no one has ever shared this type of information with you before, it’s worth examining whether you are proactively signaling that it’s a topic you are prepared to discuss. Being able to initiate and navigate uncomfortable conversations is a critical skill for effective leaders. Avoiding or mishandling any of the above discussions will create a culture of silence and an environment that’s not conducive to safety or productivity. But luckily, handling these conversations is a learnable skill that can be developed with practice. It’s on you as a leader to take this on.

Managing people Reward Your Employees — Without Breaking the Bank by Sanjiv Das August 07, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Due to the current economic slowdown, many companies are finding themselves unable to afford large annual bonuses. What can organizations do to reward top performers and keep morale high while limiting spending? The author, a CEO with one the largest housing specialty lenders in the U.S., discusses the advantage of smaller-scale, more frequent spot bonuses for improving employee satisfaction and performance. Based on scientific research and the author’s own experience, he suggests that spot bonuses offer a simple yet effective mechanism for rewarding employees during the pandemic. moodboard/Getty Images Leer en español As the ongoing public health crisis has metastasized into an economic slowdown, it’s difficult for many corporations to retain and reward their people. Many firms aren’t in the position to give their employees large annual bonuses. As the former CEO of CitiMortgage and now the CEO of Caliber Home Loans, I have seen how spot bonuses can be an effective alternative: We recently paid spot bonuses to almost all our employees to reward them for their diligent work in a tumultuous year. Indeed, companies can use a spot bonus like a scalpel to stimulate feelings of satisfaction among employees, incentivize group behaviors, and build a stronger sense of solidarity. A spot bonus is typically paid “on the spot” to individuals or a group of employees (and sometimes an organization’s entire workforce) for a specific behavior, action, or result. Because of their targeted nature, they tend to be a smaller amount of money than the annual incentive reward. In my experience, they typically range from a couple hundred dollars to a few thousand. According to research done by PayScale in 2018, these are the second most commonly used form of variable pay, tied with employee referral bonuses, after annual individual bonuses. There are many reasons you should consider using this type of compensation at your organization. First, a spot bonus can make your employees feel more satisfied — and more frequently. There’s a scientific basis to this point: In a 2001 study, neuroscientists discovered that the anticipation of monetary rewards generates a significant amount of activation in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the “reward circuitry” of the brain. In the same study, participants self-reported that they felt happier at the prospect of monetary gain. If your goal is to reward employees, then try engaging their reward circuitry more often. Instead of waiting an entire year to pay a bonus, consider introducing bonuses that employees can anticipate more frequently, such as recurring spot bonuses which are based on individual performance but also tied to the performance of the company. Not only will it more regularly stimulate “satisfied” brain activity among employees, but it will also help form a mental association between the results of the firm and individual performance. This may create more work for HR or your financial group, but your leadership team could determine the spot bonus pool for the year in advance and empower managers to allocate them accordingly throughout the year. Second, a spot bonus may improve team performance, especially if recipients are encouraged to spend this money on others. Because of the pandemic, many people are working longer hours and often doing so in isolation. Yet there is an increasing amount of research that indicates that interpersonal relationships can serve as a source of satisfaction at work. In a 2013 study, salespeople at a pharmaceutical company were divided into groups, those who received personal bonuses and those who got prosocial bonuses who were encouraged to spend these bonuses on others. Those who received prosocial bonuses spent more money buying gifts for each other like lunches for colleagues. These teams outperformed those that didn’t receive the prosocial bonuses. “When organizations give employees the opportunity to spend money on others … both the employees and the company can benefit, with increased happiness and job satisfaction and even improved team performance,” conclude the authors of the study. These findings suggest that you could pay prosocial spot bonuses that are meant to be gifted, in an effort to boost performance. Third, a spot bonus is an opportunity to demonstrate your organization’s priorities. Don’t just make it about the money. It’s not enough to only remit payments. You also have to explain how these bonuses are being paid because the firm is meeting its objectives. When my firm paid spot bonuses to almost all of our employees last year, we held an offsite in which we addressed the state of our business, described various transformation initiatives that were currently underway, and answered employee questions. Giving such a bonus presents an opportunity because you will have everyone’s attention, and they’re more likely to be open to what you and other leaders have to say. This is the time to share your vision, address queries, and inspire action. In this period of pandemic and recession, a spot bonus is a way to help employees through difficult times, as well as boost performance and morale.

Recession Taking Stock of the Covid-19 Recession by Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak , Paul Swartz and Martin Reeves August 14, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Where are we, six months into the coronavirus recession? The authors look back at five common expectations from the early days of the crisis and how they differ from where we are today. The differences in macroeconomic outcomes can largely be explained by countries’ health care and economic policies. Perhaps surprisingly, the authors found that aggressive economic policy can offset shortcomings in health care policy. Jasmin Kämmerer/EyeEm/Getty Images Leer en español Six months after the start of the coronavirus recession the macroeconomic landscape has become more, not less, confusing. Business leaders have to navigate shattered expectations, widely disparate outcomes, and continued uncertainty. Although we have seen the worst growth decline on record, financial markets are buoyant. It’s time to take a step back and reflect on the journey so far. What Was Expected — and What Happened As the crisis unfolded in February and March of this year, business leaders were forced to rapidly shift their expectations for the future. While expectations varied, we identified five disparities between common assumptions at the time and our current realities. 1. Intensity was underestimated. Economic forecasts gyrated wildly at the start of the crisis. For example, the median broker forecast for 2Q U.S. growth was still around 0% in mid-March, before collapsing 30 percentage points over the next 20 days. Over the following months the forecast settled around -35% (annualized – not to be confused with, but equivalent to, -10% quarter on quarter growth). That figure turned out to be closer to the truth (actual growth was -33% annualized, or -9.5% q/q) but the spread around the median forecast remained extremely large. Regardless of future revisions, a historically bad growth decline is now a fact and the episode highlights the limits of modeling outside of the known empirical range. 2. Systemic stability risks were overstated. The severe intensity of the crisis fueled fears of systemic meltdown, driven by liquidity and solvency problems cascading through the real and financial economy. Those risks stoked concerns of a “new great depression,” while the unprecedented policy response also stoked concerns over higher inflation, often portrayed as the trigger for a U.S. debt crisis and the end of dollar hegemony. Though fears remain, they have not been realized so far, as monetary policy has contained stress in the financial system and unprecedented fiscal policy has shored up real economy balance sheets. 3. A false dichotomy was predicted between emerging and developed economies. A common expectation was that affluent economies would weather the crisis more adroitly than less developed ones, whose ability to respond with policy would be more limited. Yet expectations about a clean correlation between economic heft and crisis outcomes, including health outcomes, have not been realized. The wide distribution of outcomes within the “developed” and “emerging” economy clusters (think U.S. vs. Greece, or Brazil vs. China) illustrates the false dichotomy. 4. Recovery “shapes” were more widely dispersed. Expectations for the path of the recovery were hotly debated, though a dominant early expectation was for a V-shaped — i.e. return to pre-crisis trends — recovery. While this today seems hopeful, ultimate recovery shapes are still being written. In fact, V-shapes have emerged at both national level (notably China) and also within the U.S., where, for example, retail sales and housing (new home sales) have bounced back and exceeded pre-crisis levels. As recovery “shapes” are more about the eventual return to pre-crisis levels and growth rates, and less about speed, it is too early to tell. Perhaps what can be said with some confidence today, is that a full return to pre-crisis trend paths looks ever more challenging as time passes and capital stock growth slows in the crisis. 5. Long-term legacies may be more concentrated than thought. The extreme intensity of the crisis infected expectations that everything will be different post-Covid. It is too early to say, but first contours have emerged on three dimensions of legacy: a break in the economic structural regime remains unlikely, particularly for the U.S. economy; as mentioned above, the structural damage question remains in flux; however there are many facets of microeconomic and behavioral shifts that look likely to become permanent, creating opportunity in adversity for some sectors and companies. Economic Policy Can Substitute for Public Health Failures While all economic downturns have their own idiosyncrasies, the underlying dynamics of this pandemic-induced recession were similar across the world: A health emergency requiring restrictive public health interventions creates a severe economic disruption, which must be bridged by economic policy. We have observed a degree of substitutability between the two policy dimensions that shape macro outcomes: Successful public health interventions reduce the cost, risk, and complexity of the needed economic policy response. However, where virus control is lacking, aggressive economic policy can offset shortcomings in health care policy. The U.S. is a case in point. Hopes that rich nations would easily control the virus were quickly dashed as it became clear that a specific mix of institutional capabilities — including health policy, government coordination, communication, and support in civil society — mattered more than economic heft. However, despite this public health outcome, the U.S. has fared somewhat better economically in 2Q than Europe where public health outcomes are widely seen to be better. The key driver of this outcome is the speed, depth, and breadth of the U.S. economic policy response that dwarfed European efforts. Economic policy capacity has effectively offset shortcomings on the health side. While minimizing the health crisis is an important goal in its own right, we think it’s difficult to link the public health outcomes with expected economic outcomes without considering the idiosyncratic abilities and willingness of nations to bridge the disruption with economic policy. The Road and Risks Ahead What can the disparities of the coronavirus crisis so far tell us about the future? Equity markets are one means to gauge the future, as the asset class purports to reflect the present value of future cash flows. The full recovery to pre-crisis levels of some U.S. markets is widely seen as seriously dissonant with the extreme hardship afflicting the real economy. Yet, apart from some idiosyncrasies (large weight in tech stocks who have won in the pandemic as well as increasingly negative real rates making equities relatively more attractive), we think the markets reflect an embedded view on the substitutability of health policy and economic policy. At this point, expectations for much more than a “muddling through” in the U.S. health policy are optimistic, however expectations for unparalleled economic policy efforts are more plausible. This will help — albeit at likely escalating cost and risk — to bridge the economic gaps left by the health care response. Equity markets have taken a view that U.S. economic policy willingness (culture of stimulus) and capacity (reserve currency status, debt capacity, and an anchored inflation regime lend the U.S. unrivaled capacity) more than offset weakness in health policy. U.S. markets’ strong performance, particularly the strong absolute recovery but also the relative outperformance (Europe), are partly driven by this view. However, this view of the future harbors two significant risks. The first stems from the market’s large bet that the aggressive hunt for a vaccine will shorten traditional development timelines. Any whiff of failure or significant delay would pierce a hole in this view, raising questions about the degree that economic policy can hold economic activity together. The second risk — potentially more damaging — is that economic policy could fail to continue bridging the gap in economic activity. As we wrote here before, this failure can generally emerge from either inability (markets reject debt issuance) or unwillingness (political failure to act). While inability is very unlikely for the U.S., unwillingness is not. At the start of an overwhelming crisis political polarization was kept in check at first. But as the crisis drags on and an election season beckons, bipartisanship can turn to intransigence. The economic response to Covid-19 could still turn into a political football. What Leaders Can Do Now Six months into this crisis, economic outcomes are no more certain — arguably less so. Here are a few things business leaders can do to prepare for the next phase of the coronavirus crisis: Pause and take stock. As curves have been flattened and economies reopened, albeit with varying degrees of success, now is the right time to take stock not only at the macro level, but also more specifically — within sectors, industries, and segments — and to reallocate resources appropriately. Build resilience. Actively prepare for multiple futures by creating optionality to maneuver. It’s tempting to see a path ahead and bet on it, but if anything, coronavirus has demonstrated the immense power to surprise and upend even well thought out assumptions about how the world works and who is likely to win. Capture advantage. Leaders also should remember firm strategy is about beating trends and averages. The greater the dispersion in outcomes across countries and sectors, the greater the opportunities for individual outperformance for those who can see them and mobilize around them.

Managing yourself Recent Grads Are Drowning in Uncertainty. Here’s How to Stay Afloat. by Meg Jay August 13, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary There are nearly fifty million twentysomethings in the United States, most of whom are living with a staggering, unprecedented amount of uncertainty. And now, millions of new would-be workers have graduated, without the pomp and circumstance, into a global pandemic and likely recession. Research shows that, rather than long for certainties that do not exist, the best way to adapt to uncertainty is to change how we think about it — and to find a way to keep moving. If you’re feeling stuck, you should try to avoid mental time-travel, build identity capital, resist reassurance, forget regret, and build healthy habits.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. There are nearly fifty million twentysomethings in the United States, most of whom are living with a staggering, unprecedented amount of uncertainty. Most have no idea where they will work or where they will live in five years. They don’t know if they are a day or a decade away from a promotion, or when they will be able to pay their bills. And now, millions of new would-be workers have graduated, without the pomp and circumstance, into a global pandemic and recession. As a psychologist who specializes in twentysomethings, I hear every day from young workers who feel overwhelmed because of the unknowns in their lives. If you feel this way too, you are far from alone. Research shows that, rather than long for certainties that do not exist, the best way to adapt to uncertainty is to change how we think about it — and to find a way to keep moving. Here are some suggestions. Avoid Time Traveling. When the future feels uncertain, we tend to spend a lot of time thinking about it. Yet, your twenties are no time for what psychologists call “time traveling,” or mentally transporting yourself to next month or next year. They are a good time to make plans for the future and to work toward those plans. But there is a difference between preparing for the future and pretending it is already here. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share There is a Tibetan proverb that goes like this: “Take care of the minutes and the years will take care of themselves.” The best way to do something about the there-and-then is to do something in the here-and-now. If you catch yourself worrying about what life will look like at 25 or 35, figure out what that means you need to get going on today. It could be as simple as writing a cover letter, scrolling job listings, or reaching out to someone in your network that could help you get where you want to go. Move from Identity Crisis to Identity Capital. Identity capital is your collection of personal assets. It is the skills and experiences and qualities that make you who you are…so far. The average young worker has eight jobs by the age of thirty. Your twenties, then, are less about finding that one-and-only “forever job” than they are about investing in yourself along the way. And most of you will need to find a job — any job — to stay afloat financially. Whatever you do, do something that adds value to who you are. “Never have a blank year,” a mentor told me once as I headed out on maternity leave. What she meant was that, even if it feels like your future is on hold due to unusual circumstances, do something you can put on your resume. Whether it’s an online financial literacy course, or a tech certification, or studying for the GMAT, good jobs aren’t the only way to build identity capital. Shift from “What if” to “What is.” The most common thinking error in uncertain situations is catastrophic thinking. It’s that worst-case-scenario thinking one of my clients calls being “a what if-er.” What if I never find a job? What if I get fired? What if my life doesn’t work out? Rather than letting your emotions run away with “What if,” slow down and practice evidence-based thinking or “What is.” Write down the evidence for — and against — this catastrophe you’re imagining. Chances are that, when you reason with yourself, you’ll see your situation is not as dire as you imagined. Be willing to ask yourself, “What is the plan should this fear come true?” If you’re worried about losing your job, make note of what you will do if that comes to pass. Facing our fears makes them less powerful. It shows us that even our biggest problems can be gotten through. Resist Reassurance Seeking. Reassurance is a coping mechanism so prevalent — and problematic — that a national conference for psychologists included a session devoted to working with “reassurance junkies.” You might be a reassurance junkie if you call your parents a dozen times a day about what you should do with your life. Or maybe you text your therapist — again and again — wondering if your job or your relationship will last. When I reassure clients they quickly — and more anxiously — return for more; it’s like a drug with a short half life. So, rather than approaching and re-approaching bosses or friends or partners for guarantees they cannot (or should not) give, shore up your own self-assurance. Think of a tough situation you faced in the past. Remind yourself of what you did to get through. You’ll gain more confidence this way and begin to see yourself — and not just other people — as capable and strong. Forget Regret. Regret is the feeling of dissatisfaction that occurs when we imagine the choice we made is worse than the one we did not. Yet, we can never know what would have happened if life played out differently. Research suggests that embracing this truth can stave off regret. So get going and travel lighter without the fear of regret. If you do find yourself weighted down with a particular regret, name what it is you think you missed out on. Work-life balance? A better boss? Stock options? Rather than looking backward at what you did not get, look forward and use regret as information about what you would like to set yourself up for next. Regret can lead to quitting, and your twenties are no time to give up. Get Healthier (and Happier). Your brain and your personality change more in your twenties than at any other time in adulthood. Whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it by building good habits. Yes, mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression and substance abuse, tend to emerge in one’s twenties (often in response to uncertainty). But they also tend to improve in one’s twenties — with effort. One of my clients started running to manage her mood. Another is using COVID lockdowns as a time to get sober. Another is looking at Instagram less and sleeping more. Yet another is getting ahead on her hobby while she finds it difficult to get ahead at work. Yes, twentysomethings are happier when they make strides at work — but twentysomethings who are happy and healthy outside of the office are better workers, too. Think of your life as a twentysomething as a plane just after takeoff. It’s a time when a small change in course can make a big difference in terms of where you end up. Yes, it is an up-in-the-air and turbulent time. But, if you figure out how to navigate, even a little bit at a time, you can get further, faster than at any other time in life.

Difficult conversations 4 Conversations Leaders in the #MeToo Era Should Be Ready For by Sarah Beaulieu August 12, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary As more and more people share their experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace, leaders must be prepared to navigate several kinds of difficult conversations with their teams. Specifically, leaders should consider how they will respond if an employee discloses an incident, how they will intervene if they see inappropriate behavior taking place at work, how they will proactively build a culture of respect, and how they will respond if an employee shares a past experience of harassment. In the #MeToo era, good leadership means not just responding to problems when they occur, but actively initiating the uncomfortable conversations that are essential to build a safe organization. Illustration by Lisa Tegtmeier Leer en español The #MeToo movement broke the silence on sexual harassment in the workplace, inspiring leaders in every industry to reckon with their organizations’ culture — and their own behavior — to build a work environment that’s safe and supportive for everyone. And as more and more people open up about their experiences with harassment and abuse, leaders can pretty much guarantee that they’ll find themselves dealing with these issues at one point or another. But good leadership is not just about responding to incidents when they occur. It’s also about being prepared to navigate the difficult conversations that help prevent sexual harassment in the first place. The more you practice and prepare for these uncomfortable conversations, the more likely you are to respond in ways that support your team and make your organization a positive place to work. 1. The disclosure conversation Both culturally and legally, a disclosure is the ultimate high-stakes conversation. Without formal reports of harassment, companies cannot hold perpetrators accountable and prevent them from continuing to behave inappropriately. However, there are real reasons why employees are reluctant to report, including a fear of not being believed, fear of retaliation, and fear of too small or too big a response. Each time a disclosure is handled with empathy and respect, it helps to rebuild organizational trust. Consider these four steps: Express empathy. It takes a lot of guts to report sexual harassment. Thank the person for sharing the information with you and validate their emotional response. You can acknowledge their feelings while still ensuring a fair process for deciding what to do next. Assess safety. Does the person feel emotionally and physically safe? Do they have the ability to stay safe until the next step in the process? If physical safety is an issue, follow your workplace guidelines and create a safety plan. If the person needs emotional support, ask whether they have someone to call, offer an internal resource such as an EAP, and/or recommend an external hotline. Give them their power back. Even if you are required to report the incident to human resources, offer the person whatever options are available to them. For example, the employee may be able to choose who will speak to human resources first, or whether the report will be made by email or by phone. Even a small choice can feel empowering for someone who has experienced loss of control. Know your own policies, compliance advice and reporting guidelines. If you know these policies cold, it will be easier to adhere to them while still expressing empathy and sounding human. Finally, recognize that a disclosure conversation is NOT a human resources investigation. Most likely, it’s the first of many conversations required to address a sexual harassment incident. There will be time for additional conversations, so focus your response to the initial disclosure on conveying deep empathy and setting up future conversations for success. 2. The intervention conversation There is a spectrum of problematic behavior in the workplace, ranging from minor red flags to obvious harassment or even violence. The earlier you intervene, the better positioned you will be to prevent major problems. Many leaders confuse an intervention conversation with a call-out conversation, which is the most direct form of intervention. The purpose of an intervention conversation is to restore safety and promote a culture of respect. Imagine attending a charity dinner on behalf of your company. A young staff member from the charity is seated at your table. One of your colleagues, a peer, is leaning pretty close to her and commenting on her appearance and attire. She keeps inching her chair away from him, and he just continues moving closer and closer. What do you do? What do you say? There are four strategies you can employ when you witness a situation that seems unsafe or disrespectful: Direct: Say something directly to your colleague, such as, “I guess you missed the memo about appropriate conversations.” If you prefer a less direct approach, you could also make a pointed joke about his inappropriate behavior, or request that he switch seats with you. Distract: You can create a distraction that interrupts the behavior. For example, ask the staff member to introduce you to her boss at another table, or offer to introduce her to one of your colleagues. Delegate: Invite someone who has a closer relationship with either person to participate in the intervention. For example, you can ask the person sitting next to you if they also find the situation inappropriate, or text the staff person’s boss to ask for their assistance. Defer: If all else fails, you can approach the young staff member after the fact, check if she is okay, and make sure she has a safe way home. Let me be clear. None of these options will feel comfortable. And all come with some risk of one or both of your colleagues getting upset. But risking a minor conflict to ensure the safety of someone with less power than you is the responsibility of a strong leader. It’s also important to note that an overzealous or inappropriate intervention runs the risk of making the situation more volatile or unsafe, so you should do your best to consider how your actions will make them feel before rushing to their defense. 3. The culture conversation As a leader, it’s up to you to proactively signal that safety and respect are important to the culture you want to build. When leaders wait until an incident takes place to discuss sexual harassment with their teams, they often come across sounding opaque or defensive. Skilled leaders find ways to broach the topic of sexual harassment – and its impact on the team – on a regular basis. Do you ever talk about sexual harassment at your all-hands meetings? Have you asked human resources to brief the executive team on your current policies and reporting structures? Have you asked sales managers what they are doing to prevent sexual harassment with clients or customers? Does your company participate in sexual assault awareness month? Don’t wait for people who are harassed – or at risk for harassment – to break the ice for you. By broaching this topic on a regular basis, you signal to employees that building a safe culture is important to you, and you make it significantly easier for people to feel comfortable coming forward to you if an issue does arise. 4. The support conversation Disclosures aren’t always about incidents that happened at work. Given that one in four women, one in six men and one in two transgender employees will experience sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime, this topic may arise in the course of your working relationships. When someone shares something like this from their past, it’s a moment to express empathy by saying something like, “I appreciate you trusting me enough to tell me,” or “I’m sorry that happened to you.” It’s also worth checking in on their safety and support network. You can simply ask, “Are you receiving the help and support you need right now?” Or, “Do you have people in your life that you can talk to about this?” Finally, while it’s not your place to provide counseling to an employee, it’s valuable to offer to check in at a specific time in the future – and follow through. Doing so demonstrates that you take their disclosure seriously and value your relationship with them. And if no one has ever shared this type of information with you before, it’s worth examining whether you are proactively signaling that it’s a topic you are prepared to discuss. Being able to initiate and navigate uncomfortable conversations is a critical skill for effective leaders. Avoiding or mishandling any of the above discussions will create a culture of silence and an environment that’s not conducive to safety or productivity. But luckily, handling these conversations is a learnable skill that can be developed with practice. It’s on you as a leader to take this on.

International business The TikTok Ban Should Worry Every Company by Keman Huang and Stuart Madnick August 28, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary While the proposed U.S. ban of the social media app TikTok may seem novel, it’s actually just the most recent high-profile incident in a string of cases of countries banning products or services over alleged cybersecurity concerns. The authors have studied more than 75 such events involving more than 31 countries going back almost 20 years. They suggest that the current trend should worry any business with an international scope, and suggest that business executives need to not only follow the best practices to improve the cybersecurity of their digital product and services, they must also prepare for political risks. Managers, as well as consumers, may encounter extreme disruptions to international trade. HBR Staff/Unsplash Leer en español Earlier this summer, the U.S. government announced it was considering banning Chinese social media apps, including the popular app TikTok. In August, President Trump signed two executive orders to block transactions with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, and Tencent, which owns the popular messaging service and commercial platform WeChat, and another executive order requiring ByteDance to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business within 90 days, as well as to destroy all its copies of TikTok data attached to U.S. users. As companies including Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle have expressed interest in buying the app, TikTok is suing the U.S. government, accusing the Trump administration of depriving it of due process. The proposed ban, according to the Trump administration, is intended to safeguard the privacy of U.S. citizens and shield data about them — and government officials — from the Chinese government. Trump’s August 6 executive order claims TikTok could “allow China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” But, is TikTok really a threat? And if it is, what are the possible consequences of these actions by the U.S.? As researchers who have studied similar bans on technologies, we believe that this chain of events could have sweeping impacts on the business community, which will likely not be confined to the tech sector. What Is the Threat? If data collection by a company with overseas connections comprises a threat, there are threats all around. The data that TikTok collects pales in comparison to, say, what most American tech companies (as well as banks, credit agencies, and hotels) collect, both visibly and less so. Many institutions that collect sensitive data have already been hacked — it is estimated that there is a cyber attack every 39 seconds — and much of that information is for sale on the Dark Web. If the Chinese government wanted the kind of information TikTok could collect, it could be obtained in many other ways. What will likely prove a more pressing threat to U.S. customers is much more low-tech: Setting a precedent of banning everyday technologies could quickly spiral out of control and seriously disrupt almost all international trade. A Growing Trend While the case against TikTok may seem novel, it’s actually just the most recent high-profile incident in a string of cases of countries banning products or services over alleged cybersecurity concerns. In our research, we have studied more than 75 such events involving more than 31 countries going back almost 20 years, though most occurred in the past five years. For example, in 2017, Germany banned My Friend Carly — a doll from the U.S. that you could talk to you — because the conversation was processed by servers in the U.S. In 2016, Russia blocked access to LinkedIn, stating that LinkedIn refused to store personal data of Russian users in Russia. In 2017 U.S. blocked the Russian security company Kaspersky over its alleged ties to the Russian government. These cases build on a trend of high-profile bans, such as when China blocked Facebook, Twitter, and Google (2009), and when BlackBerry was banned or threatened with a ban in India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (2010). Because any product that contains a computer or service that uses a computer — nowadays just about everything — can introduce cybersecurity risks, the frequency and impact of these events is increasing. (My electronic toothbrush has a computer in it and is connected to the Internet.) Examining the millions of lines of software or firmware in these products and services is not currently feasible, therefore decisions are made based on the perceived risks, which can be impacted by factors such as trust and capability to manage cybersecurity risks. There have been restrictions imposed on products and services as diverse as: medical devices, videoconference services, software products, security software, social media, security cameras, banking IT systems, drones, smartphones, smart toys, online content services, satellite communications, AI software, and financial services such as international fund transfers and payment systems. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Digital Trade Service Restrictiveness Index, 13 of the 46 majority economies have increased their digital trade restrictions between 2014 and 2019, while only four countries reduced their restrictions. In general, there are four strategies for managing risks: accept, avoid, mitigate, and transfer. There are many practical options that countries and companies can adopt to manage cybersecurity risks from cross-border digital products/services. Unfortunately, banning products is becoming increasingly common — and doesn’t appear to be a particularly sustainable strategy. Why This Time Is Different The proposed ban reinforces a growing belief that America is no longer the leading guarantor of global business, but rather a potential threat to it — a notion that is profoundly reshaping the world economy and threatening American businesses. TikTok and WeChat both have massive user bases (800 million and close to 1.2 billion, respectively). Removing WeChat from the Apple Store could cause Apple’s iPhone sales to fall by around 30% according to one prominent analyst. In an August call with White House officials, more than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns that banning WeChat could undermine their competitiveness in the Chinese market. The second-order cost of sabotaging the international business environment with these policies could be much higher: 86% of companies in the U.S.-China Business Council have reported experiencing negative impacts on their business with China. The biggest impact was lost sales because customers shift their suppliers or sourcing due to uncertainty of continued supply. Companies worried about a U.S. ban may just initiate a “De-Americanization” plan to remove or replace U.S. components in their products and supply chains. For example, in February 2019, WorldFirst, a U.K-based international money transfer service that many big Amazon sellers relied on, closed its U.S. business as a precursor to its acquisition by Chinese-based Ant Financial. This was considered the only way to avoid U.S. regulators blocking the deal over national security concerns. On the other hand, the Chinese company Hikvision found alternatives to most of its U.S. components so that being added to the U.S. trade blacklist had a limited impact on its business. Weighing the Political Risks Business executives need to realize that in addition to following the best practices to reduce the perceived cybersecurity risks from their digital product/services, preparing for political risks is also necessary. TikTok implemented several practices to mitigate the risks, including: storing U.S. user data in the U.S. and backing it up on Singaporean servers, blocking access to its data from its mother company ByteDance, hiring an American CEO and operations team, beefing up its lobbying team, withdrawing from Hong Kong based on the concerns over China’s new national security law, launching a “transparency center” for moderation and data practices in Los Angeles, banning political and advocacy advertising from its platform, and setting up a global headquarters outside of China. TikTok and its employees are preparing to battle the ban in separate lawsuits. Though these practices have not yet helped TikTok to void the ban, they will probably be major arguments in its lawsuit against the U.S. Furthermore, these practices may be important directions that all companies might need to follow for doing international business in the new normal to address concerns over cybersecurity risks. In reality, banning is more likely to increase — not reduce — risk, because it builds up distrust among countries and companies. Other countries may retaliate by banning U.S. companies and the situation could rapidly spiral. In recent years, governments have tried to increase their ability to access the data contained on these devices and services. For example, WhatsApp advertises that it “secures your conversations with end-to-end encryption, which means your messages and status updates stay between you and the people you choose.” But, several times, most recently in October 2019, the U.S., UK and Australia have applied pressure on Facebook to create backdoors that would allow access to encrypted message content. So far, Facebook and WhatsApp have refused. If such backdoors are allowed and become commonplace, then every Internet-connected device will essentially be a spy device and likely be banned by every other country. The abuse of “national security threat” is snowballing and leading to an escalating trade war that could disrupt world trade. We saw a similar situation caused by the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs in the 1930s. The goal was to protect U.S. farmers and other industries that were suffering during the Great Depression by raising tariffs and discouraging import of products from other countries. But, not surprisingly, almost all of the U.S. trade partners retaliated and raised their tariffs. That resulted in U.S. imports decreasing 66% and exports decreasing 61% making the “Great Depression” much greater. In general, there are rarely winners in trade wars, and probably not in cyber trade wars.

Our company had only 20 people in a single office in Toronto, where we produced reports on 300 companies, most of them Canadian firms traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Today we have 650 people based in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia providing ESG research, ratings, and data on tens of thousands of companies. And we’re not alone: A handful of other big rating firms, along with dozens more smaller organizations, distribute some sustainability data. What has changed even more than the size of our team and the volume of research we produce is the way ratings like ours are used. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the use of ESG information in the investment process. A decade ago this information was of interest to a relatively small segment of the investment community. Today nearly all large institutional investors utilize ESG research to some degree. That’s because recognition is growing that this data has real value and can drive better investment outcomes—not in every case, but in enough cases to make a material difference to investors. Furthermore, while ESG factors can affect a company’s bottom line directly, they also affect a company’s reputation, and business leaders and investors are recognizing the potential costs of not managing firms’ ESG risks. Creating the ratings is challenging work. There are no uniform requirements for reporting ESG information, and many environmental and social impacts are hard to measure. So the data inputs that we start with are fundamentally less structured, less complete, and of lower quality than financial data, which companies are required to present in standardized form and have audited by accountants. The lack of rules and robust metrics makes our job more difficult—but also more valuable. Because we’re compiling data and generating insights that many investors have not used in the past and don’t have easy access to, very often this information is not priced into stocks. It is important to us that the companies we assess understand how we arrive at our ratings. We consider two elements: what risks the businesses are exposed to and how well they’re managing them. We classify each company into one of 138 industries, and we have a list of relevant risks for each. For instance, a mining enterprise will typically face risks related to carbon and noncarbon emissions, environmental management systems, water use, occupational health and safety, and corporate governance, among other matters. To ascertain its risk exposure, we look at the specifics of its business. Suppose the company operates in jurisdictions where complicity in bribery and corruption is common or where managing community and labor relations is especially challenging. It faces more risks than do competitors that avoid such jurisdictions, so we’d adjust its risk exposure upward. A big part of our work is calibrating the degree of ESG risk that firms face. The next step in rating a company is to assess how well it is managing its risk exposure. This involves looking at the types of programs, policies, and management practices the company uses and its preparedness to avoid or mitigate certain risks. If we don’t have evidence that the company is adequately prepared, it gets a lower score. Firms that do have appropriate risk-handling measures in place should disclose what they are doing, to ensure that those measures are taken into account. Levels of disclosure have increased tremendously in recent years, but they’re still not as high as we’d like them to be. The way companies engage with us throughout the rating process varies quite a bit. A decade ago only 10% of firms responded to our requests and talked with us about our analysis. Today more than 60% of large companies share information with us, and that number has been growing each year. In general, businesses that take special pride in their reputation and those that have an ESG-minded investor base are willing to spend more time communicating with us. In other cases, companies that fare poorly in our ratings or are facing criticism of their sustainability or governance practices are encouraged by their investors to interact with us. Sometimes business leaders complain about “survey fatigue” and say they are hearing from too many ratings firms that request too much information. I empathize with that. Various international organizations are working to standardize ESG reporting, which will make it less onerous for company managers. Regardless, I believe it’s worth their time to engage more deeply with the firms that, like ours, have the biggest presence in the market. Once we have completed our ratings process, we send the profile to the company for feedback. During those conversations, we’re looking for any additional information or clarification that can enhance our analysis. New information doesn’t always lead to a change in our rating, but we do listen. As ESG rating outcomes become more important, we certainly hear from people inside firms who forcefully argue for their point of view. Today nearly all large institutional investors use ESG research to some degree. Companies often see their ratings move if they begin addressing sustainability issues in new ways or if a significant ESG controversy arises, which can indicate a management gap. However, some of the more dramatic improvements result from changes to risk exposure when companies embark on a strategic shift in their operations or business model. For instance, the Danish power company Ørsted (formerly known as Danske Olie og Naturgas) used to be involved in oil and gas exploration and production. In 2017, however, it sold its oil and gas assets and invested heavily in renewables; it’s now one of the world’s largest players in the offshore wind sector. The company still has some coal-fired power plants, but it has announced aggressive plans to phase them out. From 2018 to 2019 its risk rating score improved markedly. Companies’ ESG risk exposure can also move in a negative direction. For example, Facebook’s ESG ratings have fallen because of increased public alarm about the company’s handling of data privacy and security. Similarly, Amazon has seen its ESG scores decline in the wake of growing antitrust scrutiny and concern over workplace conditions for its employees. Peugeot, the French carmaker, has experienced a decline in its ESG ratings since its 2017 acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, which make less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result of the acquisition, Peugeot will most likely miss the European Union’s 2021 target for CO2 emissions, potentially exposing it to fines of several hundred million euros. For companies that want to put their best foot forward, good disclosure of their most material ESG challenges—and how they’re addressing them—goes far. The best way to improve disclosure is to issue a sustainability report that has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards. When companies invest the time to produce a thorough report, our analysis is easier and the amount of time it takes to talk with us and the other ESG ratings firms goes down quite a bit. But the most important part of the process happens when companies scrutinize their business and their business model to understand which issues are most material in terms of ESG risk. Reducing their risk exposure or finding a better way to manage the risk typically results in the greatest benefits for the company and its investors, as well as for the environment and society. The amount of analytical rigor that goes into ESG ratings has increased substantially, and that’s a good thing. These ratings are more relevant and more high-profile than ever before, and investors are paying closer attention. A poor rating draws more scrutiny to a company, and a strong rating can increase investment flows. That’s part of what makes this work so interesting. Social-Impact Efforts That Create Real Value George Serafeim Save Share Idea in Brief The Situation Many CEOs feel as if they’re doing everything that’s asked of them in terms of improving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Yet their firms aren’t being rewarded by capital markets. The Insight Following the crowd on ESG activities is not the answer. To gain a competitive advantage, firms should instead focus on the ESG issues that are financially material for them and pursue those in distinctive ways. The Actions Management should take five steps: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors. Until the mid-2010s few investors paid attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data—information about companies’ carbon footprints, labor policies, board makeup, and so forth. Today the data is widely used by investors. Some screen out poor ESG performers, assuming that the factors that cause companies to receive low ESG ratings will result in weak financial results. Some seek out high ESG performers, expecting exemplary ESG behaviors to drive superior financial results, or wishing, for ethical reasons, to invest only in “green funds.” Other investors incorporate ESG data into fundamental analysis. And some use the data as activists, investing and then urging companies to clean up their acts. It’s an open question whether ESG issues will remain as salient to investors during a global pandemic and the associated economic downturn—but my bet is that they will. That’s because companies are likely to be more resilient in the face of unexpected shocks and hardships if they are managed for the long term and in line with societal megatrends, such as inclusion and climate change. Indeed, in the opening weeks of global bear markets following the spread of Covid-19, most ESG funds outperformed their benchmarks. And when colleagues and I looked at data for more than 3,000 firms between late February and late March 2020—when global financial markets were collapsing—we found that the ones the public perceived as behaving more responsibly had less-negative stock returns than their competitors. I believe that longer term, the crisis is likely to increase awareness that companies must consider societal needs, not just short-term profits. The recent prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement, too, is creating a groundswell of support for strong diversity policies and fair employment practices. It seems clear that companies will be under growing pressure to improve their performance on ESG dimensions in the future. The challenge for many corporate leaders is that they aren’t sure how to do that. They lack understanding of exactly where they should be focusing their attention and how they should be communicating their ESG efforts. Many executives incorrectly believe that simple actions will suffice: improving ESG disclosures, releasing a sustainability report, or holding a sustainability-focused investor relations event. Some companies take those actions, fail to see a benefit, and grow disappointed or frustrated. In some cases they face criticism and negative reactions from investors. It’s easy to see why this has happened. Too many companies have embraced a “box-ticking” culture that encourages the adoption of increasingly standardized ESG activities, many of them created by analysts and consultants who rely on industry benchmarks and best practices. Those activities may well be good for society and the bottom line. Firms reap clear benefits in the form of operational efficiencies: After all, ESG measures such as reducing waste, strengthening relationships with external stakeholders, and improving risk management and compliance are good business hygiene. In many industries such efforts are now table stakes for enterprises wishing to remain competitive. But they’re not enough. Companies must move beyond box checking and window dressing. In a world that increasingly judges them on their ESG performance, they must look to more-fundamental drivers—particularly strategy—to achieve real results and be rewarded for them. Over the past two decades various colleagues and I have analyzed more than 10,000 companies, conducting 30 field studies and publishing more than 15 empirical papers. Our collective research points to the need for a new management paradigm for corporate leaders—one in which ESG considerations are embedded in both strategy and operations. In this article I describe a five-pronged approach to help companies achieve superior performance through attention to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance. Pursuing this work isn’t about ESG ratings per se—it’s about using ESG integration to create new forms of competitive advantage. And since it involves fundamental strategic and operational choices, it can’t be left entirely to the investor relations team or the sustainability department. Instead it must be a priority for the CEO and top executives and become central to the firm’s culture. Why ESG Issues Matter The most fundamental reason to try to raise your company’s ESG performance is that all human beings—in and out of corporate settings—have an obligation to behave in prosocial ways. But apart from the moral case, there are very real payoffs for focusing on ESG issues. And those extend beyond the benefits companies might enjoy because of productivity increases due to higher employee engagement, or sales increases due to more loyal and satisfied customers. First, an ESG focus can help management reduce capital costs and improve the firm’s valuation. That’s because as more investors look to put money into companies with stronger ESG performance, larger pools of capital will be available to those companies. My research colleagues and I have found this happening not only in equity markets but also in loan markets, where some banks are linking interest rates on loans to ESG performance. ING, for example, did just that in 2017 when it made a $1.2 billion loan to Philips, an innovator in health technology and consumer products. Second, positive action and transparency on ESG matters can help companies protect their valuations as more global regulators and governments mandate ESG disclosures. My research with Jody Grewal of the University of Toronto and Edward Riedl of Boston University showed that after the European Union announced broader disclosure requirements, the stock market reacted positively to firms with strong ESG disclosure and negatively to those with weak disclosure. And it’s not only developed countries that are adopting and enforcing disclosure regulations; so are many emerging markets, including South Africa, Brazil, India, and China. Many companies incorrectly believe that simple ESG actions will suffice. Third, efforts to ensure sustainable practices will help maintain shareholder satisfaction with board leadership. As more investors with more assets under management commit to ESG investing, they will have more voting power to effect changes. Shareholders in a growing number of companies have already put forward proposals to improve gender diversity on the boards, garnering a level of support that was unimaginable even 10 years ago. For example, nearly 63% of voting shareholders at Cognex, a maker of machine vision products, approved a proposal to diversify the board, while a similar measure at the real estate company Hudson Pacific Properties received 85% support. To avoid votes against directors, challenges to executive-pay initiatives, and the like, management needs to be proactive about addressing ESG issues. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, ESG practices are part of long-term strategy, and every company needs investors who support management’s vision and plans for the future. When Paul Polman became the CEO of Unilever, then an underperforming consumer goods giant, he immediately ended quarterly earnings guidance and was explicit about his commitment to long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. That led to an exodus of short-term-focused investors, thereby attracting more-patient capital. So how can companies get ahead of the trends and realize tangible financial benefits from their ESG programs? In my experience studying and advising companies with strong programs, I have identified five actions that management can take: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors. A Strategic ESG Program To date, most companies have been treating ESG efforts like a cell phone case—something added for protection (in this case, protection of the firm’s reputation). Corporate leaders need to replace this mentality with an ambitious and differentiated ESG strategy if they want to see real financial dividends. In his seminal article “What Is Strategy?” (HBR, November–December 1996), Michael Porter draws a distinction between operational effectiveness and strategy. The former, he writes, “means performing similar activities better than rivals”; the latter “is about being different.” Following Porter’s distinction, an ESG program may deliver efficiencies and other operational improvements—maybe even some that are necessary for corporate survival—but it will boost long-term financial performance only if it provides strategic differentiation from competitors. For example, some companies implement environmental-, water-, or waste-management systems in order to operate more efficiently. Although such systems would be included in ESG ratings, few if any companies would expect to establish a competitive advantage simply by adopting them. Typically, competitors can quickly follow suit and acquire similar systems. My research with Ioannis Ioannou of London Business School suggests that this is indeed what has happened. Analyzing data from close to 4,000 companies globally, we found that within most industries, ESG practices converged over the eight years from 2012 through 2019. In other words, firms are increasingly engaging in the same sorts of sustainability and governance activities—and thus failing to differentiate themselves strategically. Marlies Plank To outperform their competitors, companies need to find approaches that are more difficult to imitate. In our study we identified the ESG activities in each industry that have become widespread, which we termed common practices, and those that have not, which we termed strategic. As an example of the latter, think of Airbnb’s creation of a peer-to-peer network and a “circular economy” business model (one involving the reuse of existing assets), or Google’s unconventional approach to employee recruitment, engagement, and retention. Those distinctive practices have helped Airbnb and Google occupy competitive positions that cannot be easily replicated—and the companies have been rewarded by capital markets as a result. Indeed, our research confirms that the adoption of strategic ESG practices is significantly and positively associated with both return on capital and market valuation multiples, even after accounting for a firm’s past financial performance. So how can companies identify strategic ESG initiatives? As with any strategy, the way to start is by determining where to play and how to win. The former is particularly vital because not all ESG issues are created equal—some matter more, depending on the industry. In the energy and transportation sectors, for instance, investing to make the transition to a low-carbon economy is becoming increasingly important, affecting companies’ costs and margins. In the technology sector, however, carbon-footprint reduction is not as relevant as building a diverse organization, which can bolster a brand’s reputation and lead to increased revenue. My research with Aaron Yoon of Northwestern University and Mozaffar Khan, a former colleague at HBS, has shown that targeting the right issues brings financial benefits: In analyzing the performance of more than 2,000 U.S. companies over 21 years, we found that those firms that improved on material ESG issues significantly outperformed their competitors. (Materiality was identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, which offers a list of salient issues for 77 industries. I served as an unpaid member of SASB’s Standards Council from 2012 to 2014.) Interestingly, companies that outperformed on immaterial ESG issues slightly underperformed their competitors. This suggests that investors are becoming sophisticated enough to tell the difference between greenwashing and value creation. Of course, materiality is not a static concept. The strategic challenge for corporate leaders is to be foresighted about the ESG themes that are emerging as important industry drivers—to identify them before their competitors do (and in some cases ahead of SASB too). This requires leaders to conceptualize the various actors in the system, their incentives, and the interventions that could drive change. Although that may sound straightforward, it is not. But my research with Jean Rogers, the founder and former CEO of SASB, revealed that an ESG issue is likely to become financially material under certain conditions: when it becomes easier for management and external stakeholders to gain insight into a company’s environmental or social impact (consider how technological advances now make it possible to trace the raw materials in electronic products and discern those that have been unsustainably mined) when the media and NGOs have more power and politicians are more responsive to it (such scenarios have prompted the creation and enforcement of anticorruption laws and other new regulations) when companies lack the ability to effectively self-regulate (for instance, this is the case in the palm oil industry, where a misalignment of incentives for farmers leads to deforestation) when a company develops a differentiated service or product that replaces a “dirty” or unsustainable way of doing business (think of Tesla, with its potential to disrupt the market for gasoline-powered cars) IKEA is one company that has mapped out a strategic ESG program, transforming itself in response to accelerating environmental degradation. It has introduced various product, service, and process innovations to move away from its traditional retailing of inexpensive furniture that customers often discard quickly. It recently entered the home solar and energy-storage business, which grew by 29% in 2019. And while most competitors are focusing on using materials more efficiently or trying to find ways to recycle products after they have been designed, IKEA has launched an effort to completely rethink product design. The aim is to create products that can be reused, refurbished, remanufactured, or recycled, thereby extending their lifespan. Moreover, IKEA products will be modularized to make them easy to dismantle and reuse as raw materials when they’re no longer functional. Although this process will take years, the firm will most likely emerge as a circular-economy leader as more regulatory, consumer, and brand pressures force companies to compete on products with better environmental credentials. While IKEA’s strategy involves moving away from wasteful practices, other firms have found that strategic reviews can identify ways to differentiate by leaning in to positive impact. When senior leaders at Vaseline interviewed medical professionals at the Centers for Disease Control, Doctors Without Borders, and the UN Refugee Agency, they learned that Vaseline jelly was an indispensable part of emergency first-aid kits, particularly in developing countries. They also learned that preventable skin conditions, such as deeply cracked hands and burns from cooking on gas stoves or using kerosene lamps, were keeping people from working, going to school, and engaging in other basic activities—a situation that Vaseline could help alleviate. That insight led to a new social-impact strategy to help heal the skin of 5 million people living in crisis or conflict. The strategy connected business goals with societal needs and differentiated the brand from competitors while increasing revenue. Accountability Mechanisms The implementation of an ESG strategy involves large operational and strategic changes. It must start at the top with the board and be diffused through the entire organization. (See “The Board’s Role in Sustainability” in this package.) Yet my research shows that in most companies the board of directors is far removed from the firm’s ESG efforts. This is a mistake. The board should be the entity that ensures that ESG metrics are properly considered in executive compensation and are adequately measured and disclosed as part of the audit committee’s work. Indeed, my colleagues and I have found that one of the characteristics of organizations with high ESG performance is a process that deeply embeds ESG issues in the board’s work and in executive pay. Although most large global companies say that their boards oversee sustainability, that generally happens in a piecemeal fashion. There are exceptions. BNP Paribas is a global financial company taking a systematic approach to sustainability governance. The company has directors who are active participants in sustainable-finance forums, including a chair who was formerly the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Large polluters, such as BHP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Eskom, have linked executive incentives to their carbon emissions, motivating management to act as it faces increased risk of regulation and competition from new technologies. Microsoft and other technology firms have tied executive compensation to workforce diversity targets, an ESG issue that’s critical for an industry in which competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas, and creative thinking. The Power of Purpose A top-down approach to sustainability and good governance is not effective if it is not supported from the bottom up by a culture that rallies around ESG initiatives. Many strategic efforts fail because people further down in the organizational hierarchy don’t believe there is a true commitment to ESG goals or they lack clear direction for achieving them. Skepticism, even cynicism, leads such efforts to be sidelined or inconsistently implemented across functions, divisions, and business lines. To remedy this problem, organizations must identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it. When Claudine Gartenberg of the Wharton School, Andrea Prat of Columbia University, and I analyzed data from more than 1,000 U.S. companies and 1.5 million employees, we found that clarity about a sense of purpose declines from senior management to middle management and then to lower-level employees. We also found that firms able to flatten the hierarchy and diffuse a sense of purpose through the ranks outperformed their competitors. In recent years a lot has been written about purpose, but not much consensus exists about what the term actually means. The most high-profile articulation of the concept came from Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world. He wrote that “a company cannot achieve long-term profits without embracing purpose” because “a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to stakeholders helps a company connect more deeply to its customers and adjust to the changing demands of society.” In August 2019, CEOs from 181 of the world’s largest companies—as part of the lobbying group Business Roundtable (BRT)—modified a position that the group had held since 1977 by declaring that the purpose of a corporation is not just to serve shareholders but to create value for all stakeholders. Neither Fink’s nor BRT’s assertion explains exactly what purpose is, of course. But we definitely know what it is not: words you see on a wall when you enter company headquarters, mission statements posted on websites, or grandiose speeches by CEOs in town halls. Research has shown those to be “cheap talk” that is unrelated to real outcomes in the organization. My colleagues and I have defined purpose as how employees—the people who know the organization best—perceive the meaning and impact of their work. To measure employees’ sense of purpose in three of our recent studies, we used questions from surveys by the Great Place to Work Institute, asking participants to rate their level of agreement with statements such as “My work has special meaning; it’s not just a job,” “I feel proud of the ways that we contribute to the community,” and “Management has a clear view of where the organization is going and how to get there.” Investors seem to be paying increasing attention to companies that are effective at linking strategy to purpose. The Strategic Investor Initiative, an outgrowth of the Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose coalition, recently collaborated with KKS Advisors (which I cofounded) to analyze 20 CEO presentations on long-term strategic plans. We found that when CEOs did well at communicating corporate purpose, stock prices and trade volume rose in the following days. The implication is that investors find value in information about purpose. In one of the presentations we studied, Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck, told shareholders: “Our purpose is very clear to us and all of our people, and that is to discover and develop lifesaving medicines for society.” He added, “That’s what makes our people come to work every day. It’s what makes them make the tremendous commitment that gives them the willingness to make the discretionary effort.” For some companies, defining their purpose means leaving money on the table, at least in the short term. This is the case with automakers that are transitioning away from carbon-emitting gas-powered cars and moving toward electric vehicles, which are more eco-friendly but less profitable. The good news, though, is that we’re seeing more examples proving that a long-term trade-off between profits and sustainability is not necessary, given that companies can redesign how they generate revenue. Consider Philips Lighting, which has shifted from selling light bulb products with limited lifespans to selling lighting as a sustainable service. Customers pay for the light they use rather than investing in the physical assets, while Philips retains ownership of all lighting equipment and takes it back when it’s suitable for recycling or upgrading. Investors find value in information about purpose. Commitment to a purpose will also push companies to sometimes undertake initiatives that might not pencil out in P&L terms. Frazier described such an initiative when he spoke about Merck’s effort to develop an Ebola vaccine: “It would have been impossible to say…‘We won’t go there, because we don’t see a robust commercial market.’ And I think that’s part of what [we are] talking about in terms of having a purpose-driven organization.” As more companies work to articulate their purpose and build a culture that fully embraces it, we will learn more about what ensures success. However, my research with Gartenberg already points to three key conditions: an intentional strategy to grow leaders within the organization, resulting in the promotion of internal candidates to the CEO role; fair compensation structures (in which the ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is not extreme for the industry); and careful execution of mergers and acquisitions to avoid culture clashes. Though the reasons aren’t fully understood, the research suggests that externally hired CEOs and companies with more acquisitions need to work harder to create a sense of purpose. Operational Changes In studying firms that have successfully implemented an ESG strategy, I’ve noticed that they tend to pass through three phases: efforts to reduce risk and ensure compliance with environmental regulations and other laws; efforts to improve operating efficiency; and efforts to innovate and grow. To achieve this evolution, exemplary firms usually start by centralizing ESG activities, which is helpful for moving from a focus on risk and compliance to a focus on operating efficiency. But to reach the innovation and growth stage, companies need to decentralize ESG activities and empower corporate functions to take responsibility for them. This is true in terms of distributing power from the C-suite to middle management, but it’s also true at the board level. Initially a board needs to set up a separate sustainability committee. But at the third stage it will typically reallocate responsibilities to preexisting board committees (audit, nomination, and so forth). Of course, decentralization requires appropriate support mechanisms. For example, the chemicals company Solvay developed a tool to assess the environmental impact of each of its product applications. This has enabled decision-makers in separate functions to take environmental considerations into account when discharging their respective responsibilities—for apportioning the R&D budget, underwriting risks during the due diligence phase of acquisitions, or optimizing plant manufacturing operations as regulations change. From 2016 to 2018 Solvay saw 4% annual growth in sales of products that have low environmental impact, while sales of more-damaging products declined by 5%. As the ESG field continues to mature, investors will be looking at how organizations are structured to deliver on their stated purpose. To increase the odds of success, winning companies will make sure that the people who manage the most important determinants of ESG performance have the capabilities and resources needed to get the job done. A first step is to ensure that the chief sustainability officer, or the senior executive charged with ESG responsibilities, is the person closest to the company’s most material ESG issues. If brands are critical assets (as they are for consumer goods companies), this individual might be the chief marketing or chief brand officer. If risk management is a central concern for the enterprise (as is the case for financial institutions), this person could be the chief risk or chief investment officer. If human capital issues matter most, the responsibility for ESG activities might fall to the head of human resources. At Tyson Foods, the former chief sustainability officer also served as the executive vice president of corporate strategy and led continuous-improvement efforts. Additionally, he managed Tyson’s venture fund, which is investing in plant-based protein and cultured meat as more-sustainable alternatives to traditional meat products. Marlies Plank About the art: Marlies Plank is fascinated by the surreal effect of large soap bubbles floating through landscapes. She has photographed around the world, in locations such as Austria, Morocco, Spain, Italy, and Slovenia. Goal setting can be useful in helping companies progress from centralization to decentralization of ESG activities. Although top leaders should set ESG targets, unit heads and middle management should be empowered to figure out how to hit them. Paradoxically, audacious targets are more likely to be met than modest ones are. That was the finding that emerged when Ioannou and I, along with Shelley Xin Li of the University of Southern California, analyzed more than 800 corporate targets related to climate change. And a separate study—one I did with Grewal and my Harvard Business School colleague David Freiberg—confirmed the benefits of aiming high: We looked at more than 1,000 firms and discovered that those with relatively ambitious targets relating to climate change invested more than their peers, made significant operating changes, and, in the process, drove innovation. Communicate with the (Right) Investors Companies must avoid slavishly focusing on improving their ESG ratings, but communication with the investor community is nevertheless important. Often, however, decisions about what to measure and how to keep investors informed are clouded by misconceptions. The first is the belief among many corporate leaders that a firm’s investor base is not subject to influence or control by management. In reality, a company can influence who buys its stock and, if necessary, change the base of shareholders. It’s not as easy as shaping one’s customer or employee base, but it’s possible. For example, before Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, it significantly altered its investor base from 2006 to 2012 by committing to integrating financially material ESG issues into its strategy and reporting on them to its shareholders. Dedicated long-term investors (including Aviva Investors, Scottish Widows, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund) initially owned a small fraction of Shire’s stock, but their holdings increased steadily and eventually became greater than those of transient investors—a highly uncommon phenomenon for a publicly listed company. The second misconception is that the demands of sell-side analysts employed by big brokerage houses should determine what must be communicated. Most companies still emphasize mostly short-term information in their investor communications. That’s because they view the sell side as the traditional “customer” of investor relations. That needs to change; the focus should be on communicating directly with the buy side—the large institutional asset managers that hold the company’s stock. Some companies are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting. The third misconception is that ESG metrics are sufficient for investors to integrate ESG considerations into their business analysis, valuation, and modeling. In fact, investors struggle to embed those metrics in financial models because it’s not clear what they mean or how they can affect the financials. One solution might be the creation of a system of impact-weighted accounting that could measure a firm’s environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), convert them to monetary terms, and then reflect them in financial statements. Though the science to do this has yet to be perfected, such a system holds great promise for three reasons: It would translate impacts into units of measurement that business managers and investors understand; it would allow for the use of financial and business analysis tools to consider those impacts; and it would enable an aggregation and comparison of analyses across types of impact that would not be possible without standardized units of measurement. At the Impact-Weighted Accounts Initiative (a Harvard Business School project that I lead), we are collaborating with the Global Steering Group for Impact Investing and the Impact Management Project on a simple approach: adjusting traditional accounting measures to consider the various types of impact that ESG actions might have. These include product impact, which affects revenue numbers; employment impact, which affects employee expenditures on the income statement; and environmental impact, which affects the cost of goods sold. For example, positive product impact could mean more revenue for a company and potentially higher growth. Positive employment impact (measured by, say, resources spent on employee training) would send investors a strong signal that management views employee expenditures as investments that lead to future profitability and not merely as expenses. Negative environmental impact might raise the cost of goods sold, by triggering new and restrictive regulations. Valuing a company’s effects on people and the planet—and integrating that into traditional financial analysis—will offer a more comprehensive picture of actual corporate performance. Some companies, such as the science-oriented DSM and the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting. Novartis estimated its employment impact for 2017—including benefits derived from employee development, occupational safety efforts, and payment of a living wage—at $7 billion. Its environmental impact, as measured by carbon emissions and water and waste impacts, was calculated at $4.7 billion. Positive product impact, something that has been largely missing from most ESG investment frameworks, was estimated at $72 billion. A final, fundamental misconception about investor relations is the idea that ESG disclosure is transaction-based and can happen intermittently. Companies need to instead see it as an opportunity for continual reputation and relationship building. It used to be that most communication with investors (the buy side) was happening through Wall Street analysts (the sell side). Increasingly, investors want a direct line of communication, and they appreciate proactive information sharing, which has the added benefit of extending investor patience. Performance declines may occur. But if CEOs come to investors with an excuse after the fact, without having built trust, they are unlikely to be given the leeway or the time they need to reverse the decline. The Path Forward Many companies have failed to recognize that the functional role of ESG data has changed over time. Initially such data was used to judge a company’s willingness to avoid harm and do good. As a result, it was primarily an input to help form policies that signaled a firm’s commitment to achieving positive outcomes for the environment and society. However, investors are increasingly asking a different question: not whether a company has good intentions but whether it has the strategic vision and capabilities to achieve and maintain strong ESG performance. That means companies need to start measuring and reporting the results of their initiatives. Instead of communicating their policies for improving data privacy, water management, climate change mitigation, diversity, and other issues, they must communicate outcome metrics such as the number of customer accounts hacked, liters of water consumed per unit of product produced, carbon emissions saved, and percentage of women and people of color promoted internally to management positions. Moving from intention to results is the next evolution that investors are looking for. The only way to outperform in this new era will be for companies to make material ESG issues central to their strategy and operations, to go above and beyond their competitors, and then to measure and communicate their superior performance. Global society faces enormous challenges. But if companies are bold and strategic with their ESG activities, they will be rewarded. George Serafeim is the Charles M.

Stroehle Save Share Marlies Plank Sustainability has gone mainstream in the corporate world. Investors increasingly understand that a corporation’s performance on pertinent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors directly affects long-term profitability—a recognition that is transforming “sustainable investing” into, more simply, “investing.” Most CEOs also now recognize that ESG issues should inform their corporate strategy. But one important constituency remains a stubborn holdout in the sustainability revolution: corporate boards. It is an unfortunate truth that directors tasked with securing their company’s future are often holding the enterprise back with an outdated emphasis on short-term value maximization. A 2019 PwC surveyof more than 700 public-company directors found that 56% thought boards were spending too much time on sustainability. Some of the myopia can be traced to a lack of diversity on boards. Most directors are male, white, and from a similar background, and many are retired executives who came of age professionally at a time when the link between ESG factors and corporate performance was not clearly understood. But a large part of the problem is that until recently, boards didn’t have a mandate to grapple with sustainability; instead, their time was consumed by compliance tasks driven by the corporate secretary and by inside and outside counsel. The concept of “corporate purpose” provides the impetus that boards need to increase their focus on ESG concerns and manage their firms for long-term success. A clear and compelling mission should be at the heart of every company’s efforts to enhance its positive impacts on the environment and society. Without such a purpose, a company cannot have a sustainable corporate strategy, and investors cannot earn sustainable returns. And the ultimate responsibility for defining that purpose must rest with the board, because it has a duty to take an intergenerational perspective that extends beyond the tenure of any management team. Our research on injecting purpose into corporate governance draws on extensive conversations with board chairs, executives, and owners of more than 100 corporations operating across a wide range of industries in more than 20 countries. We’ve undertaken that research as part of the Enacting Purpose Initiative, a multigroup project led by the University of Oxford in conjunction with the University of California, Berkeley; the investment management firm Federated Hermes; the corporate law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and the British Academy. The initiative brings together leaders from academia and practice in the United States and Europe to provide research and guidance on linking corporate purpose to strategy and performance. A major output of this effort is a framework to help boards deliver on purpose. Called SCORE, it was initially devised by Rupert Younger, the director of the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation and the chair of the Enacting Purpose Initiative. SCORE outlines five actions—simplify, connect, own, reward, and exemplify—that can help boards articulate and foster a firm’s durable value proposition and its drivers. Simplify Enacting purpose begins with knowing what it is. For that reason, purpose needs to be simple and clear—straightforward enough to be understood by the entire corporate workforce, the wider supply chain, and other stakeholders. How should purpose be communicated? A good place for boards to start is with a statement of purpose signed and issued by all the directors. The board chair and the governance committee should take the lead in drafting it. The statement should define how the company aims to create value by fulfilling unmet needs in society. It should acknowledge the negative impacts the company must mitigate if it is to retain public support and its license to operate. And it should present a distinctive message—not something so generic that the name of any major competitor could be substituted. If those criteria are met, the statement can be a powerful tool for sharing a company’s vision for long-term value creation, even in industries with negative externalities. EQT, a global private-equity firm, describes its purpose this way: “to future-proof companies and make a positive impact.” EQT defines future-proofing as anticipating what companies need to do to stay relevant amid increasing social and environmental pressures. Its one-page purpose statement, which was first published in its 2019 annual report, explains the firm’s commitment to “being more than capital.” EQT requires that any investment meet clear financial objectives but also contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The company’s founder, Conni Jonsson, told us that writing the statement was fairly easy and that publishing it unites executives, directors, and investors on the company’s priorities. “For us,” he said, “aligning on the statement of purpose was merely manifesting what has been our mindset since inception.” Connect Once corporate purpose has been articulated, it must be connected to strategy and capital allocation decisions. Strategy is about making certain choices and consciously rejecting others after serious deliberation. Capital allocation decisions naturally follow. Sometimes the process might lead a firm to sacrifice short-term profits by abandoning a lucrative but socially harmful product, such as when Dick’s Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault weapons. Other times a company might undertake a project that will certainly lose money, such as when Medtronic publicly shared the design specifications for its ventilators early in the Covid-19 pandemic to speed up manufacturing of the lifesaving devices. Connecting purpose to strategy gives a CEO the necessary foundation to prioritize long-term goals and resist pressure from activist investors and others who care only about short-term returns. “We have made some specific investments that we might not have made without our purpose being so clearly articulated,” Mark Preston, the executive trustee and group CEO of the property behemoth Grosvenor Estate, told us. “More importantly, there are probably some investments that we have not made, as a result of our purpose.” Own Ownership of purpose starts with the board, which must put in place appropriate structures, control systems, and processes for enacting purpose. This goes beyond delegation to the risk, compliance, and ethics committees. Senior management should take responsibility for ensuring that the company’s mission is embraced by everyone in the organization, right down to workers on the shop floor. It does this through its own actions, particularly when making tough trade-off decisions. Effective ownership requires that employees be fully consulted and engaged in delivering on the company’s stated purpose. Although management is responsible for direct communications with staffers, the board can create and oversee internal communication strategies to ensure that the company’s purpose is being effectively diffused throughout the organization. At firms where a controlling family owns large blocks of shares or votes—as is the case in many of the largest companies around the world—the family’s representatives on the board can be especially forceful in helping the company find and execute its purpose. That has certainly been true at Ford Motor Company. “Our drive for environmental sustainability has come from our executive chairman, Bill Ford,” says Henry Ford III, a corporate strategist and the great-great-grandson of the company’s founder. “He was the one who really pushed us to do annual sustainability reports where we are transparent about the progress we are making in terms of reaching our environmental goals.” Reward Primarily through its compensation committee, the board is responsible for establishing the metrics that will be used to determine promotion and remuneration throughout the organization. Purpose, not simply profits, needs to be rewarded. Today compensation is largely based on short-term financial metrics. That has to change: A broader set of financial and nonfinancial metrics should be used to evaluate performance over longer time frames. And the place to start is with the board’s structuring of compensation for senior executives. For example, after British taxpayers bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland during the financial crisis of 2008, the bank’s board of directors linked 25% of executives’ variable pay to key performance indicators in the areas of “customer and stakeholder” and “people and culture.” When choosing the right metrics to tie to rewards, performance should be evaluated in terms of both the company’s ESG activities and the external impact of its products and services. Materiality needs to be a cornerstone—the board and management must be aligned on which ESG issues are relevant to the company’s financial performance and should therefore be baked into executive compensation. For example, carbon emissions are not material for an insurance company, but for a coal-fired utility company they certainly are. Ideally, the measures used to assess performance and drive rewards will eventually be based on a set of independent, rigorous global standards for evaluating ESG impacts, similar to the standards that have long been used to gauge financial performance. The foundation for this has already been laid by the work of the Global Reporting Initiative, the Impact Management Project (IMP), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). (Disclosure: One of us, Eccles, was the founding chairman of SASB and is an unpaid adviser to the IMP.) When this work is complete, standardized ESG reporting will enable peer comparisons of how each company is positioned to handle the risks and opportunities presented by nonfinancial issues. Boards can then more easily link a company’s performance on these metrics to executive compensation. Exemplify Purpose and how it is being achieved must be exemplified in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Quantitatively, a company should integrate its reporting on financial performance with its reporting on sustainability performance, showing how results in the two areas are related. Qualitatively, it is important to have a consistent narrative that includes stories about what the company and its people are doing to fulfill its purpose. Patagonia, the outdoor-clothing retailer, gets this better than most. Its stated purpose—“We’re in business to save our home planet”—drives all its activities. The company not only makes eco-friendly apparel but also engages aggressively in environmental advocacy and promotes an appreciation of sustainable practices and the natural world with beautifully crafted, visually appealing stories on its website and social media. At the U.S. food manufacturer J.M. Smucker, purpose involves “feeding connections that help us thrive.” The firm aims to create “meaningful connections…for those we love and the communities in which we live,” and that’s exemplified in the way it treats its employees. As the executive chairman, Richard Smucker, told us, “You demonstrate your purpose when you take action. Sometimes you’re put in tough ethical situations and it’s about how you respond. For example, when closing plants, we have always given plenty of notice to make time for transition. You get respect because you’ve given respect.” He added, “To communicate our commitment, every year we print a small handbook for all employees with our purpose, our commitment to each other, and our strategy. You can carry in your pocket why we do things, how we do them, and what we do.” A New Duty When we promote the SCORE framework to directors, they often respond with a common fallacy: They cannot elevate corporate purpose because they have a fiduciary duty to put shareholders’ interests above all others. Setting aside the growing evidence that superior performance on material ESG issues leads to superior financial performance, it is simply not true that shareholders must come first. Shareholders are obviously important, but other stakeholders—such as employees, customers, and suppliers—are also crucial to a company’s long-term prospects. To dispel directors’ misconceptions, we recently gathered legal memos on fiduciary duty from all G20 countries and 14 others. None offered an endorsement of shareholder primacy. This was true even in the United States. For example, a memo issued by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz stated: “A corporation ignores environmental and social challenges at its own peril. Corporate boards are obligated to identify and address these risks as part of their essential fiduciary duty to protect the long-term value of the corporation itself.” The key to putting the SCORE framework into practice is finding people and organizations willing to be among the first to act. A natural place to look for them is among the members of Business Roundtable (BRT), the lobbying group that declared in 2019 that the purpose of a corporation is to create value for all stakeholders. Nearly 200 CEOs, including the heads of some of the world’s largest companies, endorsed that idea. Each of those leaders’ boards should now walk the talk by publishing a firm-specific statement of purpose and implementing the SCORE framework. If the directors at the BRT companies fail to act, their behavior will not only breed cynicism but leave them vulnerable to ongoing attack by investors demanding more-concrete action on ESG issues. If investors are to better identify a corporation’s role in society and its prospects for long-term financial returns, board members need to articulate and disclose their company’s durable value proposition and its drivers. The SCORE framework provides a tool to do that. We hope more boards will use it to promote long-term value creation and a more just and sustainable economy. Robert G.

The Challenge of Rating ESG Performance Simon MacMahon Save Share Marlies Plank When I began working at Sustainalytics in 2008, after completing an MBA in finance and sustainability, the business of rating companies on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance was very much a niche field. Our company had only 20 people in a single office in Toronto, where we produced reports on 300 companies, most of them Canadian firms traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Today we have 650 people based in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia providing ESG research, ratings, and data on tens of thousands of companies. And we’re not alone: A handful of other big rating firms, along with dozens more smaller organizations, distribute some sustainability data. What has changed even more than the size of our team and the volume of research we produce is the way ratings like ours are used. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the use of ESG information in the investment process. A decade ago this information was of interest to a relatively small segment of the investment community. Today nearly all large institutional investors utilize ESG research to some degree. That’s because recognition is growing that this data has real value and can drive better investment outcomes—not in every case, but in enough cases to make a material difference to investors. Furthermore, while ESG factors can affect a company’s bottom line directly, they also affect a company’s reputation, and business leaders and investors are recognizing the potential costs of not managing firms’ ESG risks. Creating the ratings is challenging work. There are no uniform requirements for reporting ESG information, and many environmental and social impacts are hard to measure. So the data inputs that we start with are fundamentally less structured, less complete, and of lower quality than financial data, which companies are required to present in standardized form and have audited by accountants. The lack of rules and robust metrics makes our job more difficult—but also more valuable. Because we’re compiling data and generating insights that many investors have not used in the past and don’t have easy access to, very often this information is not priced into stocks. It is important to us that the companies we assess understand how we arrive at our ratings. We consider two elements: what risks the businesses are exposed to and how well they’re managing them. We classify each company into one of 138 industries, and we have a list of relevant risks for each. For instance, a mining enterprise will typically face risks related to carbon and noncarbon emissions, environmental management systems, water use, occupational health and safety, and corporate governance, among other matters. To ascertain its risk exposure, we look at the specifics of its business. Suppose the company operates in jurisdictions where complicity in bribery and corruption is common or where managing community and labor relations is especially challenging. It faces more risks than do competitors that avoid such jurisdictions, so we’d adjust its risk exposure upward. A big part of our work is calibrating the degree of ESG risk that firms face. The next step in rating a company is to assess how well it is managing its risk exposure. This involves looking at the types of programs, policies, and management practices the company uses and its preparedness to avoid or mitigate certain risks. If we don’t have evidence that the company is adequately prepared, it gets a lower score. Firms that do have appropriate risk-handling measures in place should disclose what they are doing, to ensure that those measures are taken into account. Levels of disclosure have increased tremendously in recent years, but they’re still not as high as we’d like them to be. The way companies engage with us throughout the rating process varies quite a bit. A decade ago only 10% of firms responded to our requests and talked with us about our analysis. Today more than 60% of large companies share information with us, and that number has been growing each year. In general, businesses that take special pride in their reputation and those that have an ESG-minded investor base are willing to spend more time communicating with us. In other cases, companies that fare poorly in our ratings or are facing criticism of their sustainability or governance practices are encouraged by their investors to interact with us. Sometimes business leaders complain about “survey fatigue” and say they are hearing from too many ratings firms that request too much information. I empathize with that. Various international organizations are working to standardize ESG reporting, which will make it less onerous for company managers. Regardless, I believe it’s worth their time to engage more deeply with the firms that, like ours, have the biggest presence in the market. Once we have completed our ratings process, we send the profile to the company for feedback. During those conversations, we’re looking for any additional information or clarification that can enhance our analysis. New information doesn’t always lead to a change in our rating, but we do listen. As ESG rating outcomes become more important, we certainly hear from people inside firms who forcefully argue for their point of view. Today nearly all large institutional investors use ESG research to some degree. Companies often see their ratings move if they begin addressing sustainability issues in new ways or if a significant ESG controversy arises, which can indicate a management gap. However, some of the more dramatic improvements result from changes to risk exposure when companies embark on a strategic shift in their operations or business model. For instance, the Danish power company Ørsted (formerly known as Danske Olie og Naturgas) used to be involved in oil and gas exploration and production. In 2017, however, it sold its oil and gas assets and invested heavily in renewables; it’s now one of the world’s largest players in the offshore wind sector. The company still has some coal-fired power plants, but it has announced aggressive plans to phase them out. From 2018 to 2019 its risk rating score improved markedly. Companies’ ESG risk exposure can also move in a negative direction. For example, Facebook’s ESG ratings have fallen because of increased public alarm about the company’s handling of data privacy and security. Similarly, Amazon has seen its ESG scores decline in the wake of growing antitrust scrutiny and concern over workplace conditions for its employees. Peugeot, the French carmaker, has experienced a decline in its ESG ratings since its 2017 acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, which make less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result of the acquisition, Peugeot will most likely miss the European Union’s 2021 target for CO2 emissions, potentially exposing it to fines of several hundred million euros. For companies that want to put their best foot forward, good disclosure of their most material ESG challenges—and how they’re addressing them—goes far. The best way to improve disclosure is to issue a sustainability report that has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards. When companies invest the time to produce a thorough report, our analysis is easier and the amount of time it takes to talk with us and the other ESG ratings firms goes down quite a bit. But the most important part of the process happens when companies scrutinize their business and their business model to understand which issues are most material in terms of ESG risk. Reducing their risk exposure or finding a better way to manage the risk typically results in the greatest benefits for the company and its investors, as well as for the environment and society. The amount of analytical rigor that goes into ESG ratings has increased substantially, and that’s a good thing. These ratings are more relevant and more high-profile than ever before, and investors are paying closer attention. A poor rating draws more scrutiny to a company, and a strong rating can increase investment flows. That’s part of what makes this work so interesting.

Diversity How to Promote Racial Equity in the Workplace by Robert Livingston From the September–October 2020 Issue Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies View more from the September–October 2020 Issue Explore the Archive Executive Summary Many White people deny the existence of racism against people of color because they assume that racism is defined by deliberate actions motivated by malice and hatred. However, racism can occur without conscious awareness or intent. When defined simply as differential evaluation or treatment based solely on race, regardless of intent, racism occurs far more frequently than most White people suspect. As intractable as it seems, racism in the workplace can be effectively addressed. Because organizations are small, autonomous entities that afford leaders a high level of control over norms and policies, they are ideal sites for promoting racial equity. Companies should move through the five stages of a process called PRESS: (1) Problem awareness, (2) Root-cause analysis, (3) Empathy, or level of concern about the problem and the people it afflicts, (4) Strategies for addressing the problem, and (5) Sacrifice, or willingness to invest the time, energy, and resources necessary for strategy implementation. Idea in Brief The Problem Racial discrimination—defined as differential evaluation or treatment based solely on race, regardless of intent—remains prevalent in organizations and occurs far more frequently than most White people suspect. The Opportunity Intractable as it seems, racism in the workplace can be effectively addressed. Because organizations are autonomous entities that afford leaders a high level of control over norms and policies, they are ideal places to promote racial equity. The Way Forward Effective interventions move through stages, from understanding the underlying condition, to developing genuine concern, to focusing on correction. Leer en español Intractable as it seems, the problem of racism in the workplace can be effectively addressed with the right information, incentives, and investment. Corporate leaders may not be able to change the world, but they can certainly change their world. Organizations are relatively small, autonomous entities that afford leaders a high level of control over cultural norms and procedural rules, making them ideal places to develop policies and practices that promote racial equity. In this article, I’ll offer a practical road map for making profound and sustainable progress toward that goal. I’ve devoted much of my academic career to the study of diversity, leadership, and social justice, and over the years I’ve consulted on these topics with scores of Fortune 500 companies, federal agencies, nonprofits, and municipalities. Often, these organizations have called me in because they are in crisis and suffering—they just want a quick fix to stop the pain. But that’s akin to asking a physician to write a prescription without first understanding the patient’s underlying health condition. Enduring, long-term solutions usually require more than just a pill. Organizations and societies alike must resist the impulse to seek immediate relief for the symptoms, and instead focus on the disease. Otherwise they run the risk of a recurring ailment. To effectively address racism in your organization, it’s important to first build consensus around whether there is a problem (most likely, there is) and, if so, what it is and where it comes from. If many of your employees do not believe that racism against people of color exists in the organization, or if feedback is rising through various communication channels showing that Whites feel that they are the real victims of discrimination, then diversity initiatives will be perceived as the problem, not the solution. This is one of the reasons such initiatives are frequently met with resentment and resistance, often by mid-level managers. Beliefs, not reality, are what determine how employees respond to efforts taken to increase equity. So, the first step is getting everyone on the same page as to what the reality is and why it is a problem for the organization. But there’s much more to the job than just raising awareness. Effective interventions involve many stages, which I’ve incorporated into a model I call PRESS. The stages, which organizations must move through sequentially, are: (1) Problem awareness, (2) Root-cause analysis, (3) Empathy, or level of concern about the problem and the people it afflicts, (4) Strategies for addressing the problem, and (5) Sacrifice, or willingness to invest the time, energy, and resources necessary for strategy implementation. Organizations going through these stages move from understanding the underlying condition, to developing genuine concern, to focusing on correction. Let’s now have a closer look at these stages and examine how each informs, at a practical level, the process of working toward racial equity. Problem Awareness To a lot of people, it may seem obvious that racism continues to oppress people of color. Yet research consistently reveals that many Whites don’t see it that way. For example, a 2011 study by Michael Norton and Sam Sommers found that on the whole, Whites in the United States believe that systemic anti-Black racism has steadily decreased over the past 50 years—and that systemic anti-White racism (an implausibility in the United States) has steadily increased over the same time frame. The result: As a group, Whites believe that there is more racism against them than against Blacks. Other recent surveys echo Sommers and Norton’s findings, one revealing, for example, that 57% of all Whites and 66% of working-class Whites consider discrimination against Whites to be as big a problem as discrimination against Blacks and other people of color. These beliefs are important, because they can undermine an organization’s efforts to address racism by weakening support for diversity policies. (Interestingly, surveys taken since the George Floyd murder indicate an increase in perceptions of systemic racism among Whites. But it’s too soon to tell whether those surveys reflect a permanent shift or a temporary uptick in awareness.) Even managers who recognize racism in society often fail to see it in their own organizations. For example, one senior executive told me, “We don’t have any discriminatory policies in our company.” However, it is important to recognize that even seemingly “race neutral” policies can enable discrimination. Other executives point to their organizations’ commitment to diversity as evidence for the absence of racial discrimination. “Our firm really values diversity and making this a welcoming and inclusive place for everybody to work,” another leader remarked. The real challenge for organizations is not figuring out “What can we do?” but rather “Are we willing to do it?” Despite these beliefs, many studies in the 21st century have documented that racial discrimination is prevalent in the workplace, and that organizations with strong commitments to diversity are no less likely to discriminate. In fact, research by Cheryl Kaiser and colleagues has demonstrated that the presence of diversity values and structures can actually make matters worse, by lulling an organization into complacency and making Blacks and ethnic minorities more likely to be ignored or harshly treated when they raise valid concerns about racism. Many White people deny the existence of racism against people of color because they assume that racism is defined by deliberate actions motivated by malice and hatred. However, racism can occur without conscious awareness or intent. When defined simply as differential evaluation or treatment based solely on race, regardless of intent, racism occurs far more frequently than most White people suspect. Let’s look at a few examples. In a well-publicized résumé study by the economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, applicants with White-sounding names (such as Emily Walsh) received, on average, 50% more callbacks for interviews than equally qualified applicants with Black-sounding names (such as Lakisha Washington). The researchers estimated that just being White conferred the same benefit as an additional eight years of work experience—a dramatic head start over equally qualified Black candidates. Research shows that people of color are well-aware of these discriminatory tendencies and sometimes try to counteract them by masking their race. A 2016 study by Sonia Kang and colleagues found that 31% of the Black professionals and 40% of the Asian professionals they interviewed admitted to “Whitening” their résumés, either by adopting a less “ethnic” name or omitting extracurricular experiences (a college club membership, for instance) that might reveal their racial identities. These findings raise another question: Does Whitening a résumé actually benefit Black and Asian applicants, or does it disadvantage them when applying to organizations seeking to increase diversity? In a follow-up experiment, Kang and her colleagues sent Whitened and non-Whitened résumés of Black or Asian applicants to 1,600 real-world job postings across various industries and geographical areas in the United States. Half of these job postings were from companies that expressed a strong desire to seek diverse candidates. They found that Whitening résumés by altering names and extracurricular experiences increased the callback rate from 10% to nearly 26% for Blacks, and from about 12% to 21% for Asians. What’s particularly unsettling is that a company’s stated commitment to diversity failed to diminish this preference for Whitened résumés. A Road Map for Racial Equity Organizations move through these stages sequentially, first establishing an understanding of the underlying condition, then developing genuine concern, and finally focusing on correcting the problem. This is a very small sample of the many studies that have confirmed the prevalence of racism in the workplace, all of which underscore the fact that people’s beliefs and biases must be recognized and addressed as the first step toward progress. Although some leaders acknowledge systemic racism in their organizations and can skip step one, many may need to be convinced that racism persists, despite their “race neutral” policies or pro-diversity statements. Root-Cause Analysis Understanding an ailment’s roots is critical to choosing the best remedy. Racism can have many psychological sources—cognitive biases, personality characteristics, ideological worldviews, psychological insecurity, perceived threat, or a need for power and ego enhancement. But most racism is the result of structural factors—established laws, institutional practices, and cultural norms. Many of these causes do not involve malicious intent. Nonetheless, managers often misattribute workplace discrimination to the character of individual actors—the so-called bad apples—rather than to broader structural factors. As a result, they roll out trainings to “fix” employees while dedicating relatively little attention to what may be a toxic organizational culture, for example. It is much easier to pinpoint and blame individuals when problems arise. When police departments face crises related to racism, the knee-jerk response is to fire the officers involved or replace the police chief, rather than examining how the culture licenses, or even encourages, discriminatory behavior. Appealing to circumstances beyond one’s control is another way to exonerate deeply embedded cultural or institutional practices that are responsible for racial disparities. For example, an oceanographic organization I worked with attributed its lack of racial diversity to an insurmountable pipeline problem. “There just aren’t any Black people out there studying the migration patterns of the humpback whale,” one leader commented. Most leaders were unaware of the National Association of Black Scuba Divers, an organization boasting thousands of members, or of Hampton University, a historically Black college on the Chesapeake Bay, which awards bachelor’s degrees in marine and environmental science. Both were entities that could source Black candidates for the job, especially given that the organization only needed to fill dozens, not thousands, of openings. Diana Ejaita A Fortune 500 company I worked with cited similar pipeline problems. Closer examination revealed, however, that the real culprit was the culture-based practice of promoting leaders from within the organization—which already had low diversity—rather than conducting a broader industry-wide search when leadership positions became available. The larger lesson here is that an organization’s lack of diversity is often tied to inadequate recruitment efforts rather than an empty pipeline. Progress requires a deeper diagnosis of the routine practices that drive the outcomes leaders wish to change. To help managers and employees understand how being embedded within a biased system can unwittingly influence outcomes and behaviors, I like to ask them to imagine being fish in a stream. In that stream, a current exerts force on everything in the water, moving it downstream. That current is analogous to systemic racism. If you do nothing—just float—the current will carry you along with it, whether you’re aware of it or not. If you actively discriminate by swimming with the current, you will be propelled faster. In both cases, the current takes you in the same direction. From this perspective, racism has less to do with what’s in your heart or mind and more to do with how your actions or inactions amplify or enable the systemic dynamics already in place. Workplace discrimination often comes from well-educated, well-intentioned, open-minded, kindhearted people who are just floating along, severely underestimating the tug of the prevailing current on their actions, positions, and outcomes. Anti-racism requires swimming against that current, like a salmon making its way upstream. It demands much more effort, courage, and determination than simply going with the flow. In short, organizations must be mindful of the “current,” or the structural dynamics that permeate the system, not just the “fish,” or individual actors that operate within it. Empathy Once people are aware of the problem and its underlying causes, the next question is whether they care enough to do something about it. There is a difference between sympathy and empathy. Many White people experience sympathy, or pity, when they witness racism. But what’s more likely to lead to action in confronting the problem is empathy—experiencing the same hurt and anger that people of color are feeling. People of color want solidarity—and social justice—not sympathy, which simply quiets the symptoms while perpetuating the disease. If your employees don’t believe that racism exists in the company, then diversity initiatives will be perceived as the problem, not the solution. One way to increase empathy is through exposure and education. The video of George Floyd’s murder exposed people to the ugly reality of racism in a visceral, protracted, and undeniable way. Similarly, in the 1960s, northern Whites witnessed innocent Black protesters being beaten with batons and blasted with fire hoses on television. What best prompts people in an organization to register concern about racism in their midst, I’ve found, are the moments when their non-White coworkers share vivid, detailed accounts of the negative impact that racism has on their lives. Managers can raise awareness and empathy through psychologically safe listening sessions—for employees who want to share their experiences, without feeling obligated to do so—supplemented by education and experiences that provide historical and scientific evidence of the persistence of racism. For example, I spoke with Mike Kaufmann, CEO of Cardinal Health—the 16th largest corporation in America—who credited a visit to the Equal Justice Initiative’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, in Montgomery, Alabama as a pivotal moment for the company. While diversity and inclusion initiatives have been a priority for Mike and his leadership team for well over a decade, their focus and conversations related to racial inclusion increased significantly during 2019. As he expressed to me, “Some Americans think when slavery ended in the 1860s that African Americans have had an equal opportunity ever since. That’s just not true. Institutional systemic racism is still very much alive today; it’s never gone away.” Kaufmann is planning a comprehensive education program, which will include a trip for executives and other employees to visit the museum, because he is convinced that the experience will change hearts, open eyes, and drive action and behavioral change. Empathy is critical for making progress toward racial equity because it affects whether individuals or organizations take any action and if so, what kind of action they take. There are at least four ways to respond to racism: join in and add to the injury, ignore it and mind your own business, experience sympathy and bake cookies for the victim, or experience empathic outrage and take measures to promote equal justice. The personal values of individual employees and the core values of the organization are two factors that affect which actions are undertaken. Strategy After the foundation has been laid, it’s finally time for the “what do we do about it” stage. Most actionable strategies for change address three distinct but interconnected categories: personal attitudes, informal cultural norms, and formal institutional policies. To most effectively combat discrimination in the workplace, leaders should consider how they can run interventions on all three of these fronts simultaneously. Focusing only on one is likely to be ineffective and could even backfire. For example, implementing institutional diversity policies without any attempt to create buy-in from employees is likely to produce a backlash. Likewise, focusing just on changing attitudes without also establishing institutional policies that hold people accountable for their decisions and actions may generate little behavioral change among those who don’t agree with the policies. Establishing an anti-racist organizational culture, tied to core values and modeled by behavior from the CEO and other top leaders at the company, can influence both individual attitudes and institutional policies. Just as there is no shortage of effective strategies for losing weight or promoting environmental sustainability, there are ample strategies for reducing racial bias at the individual, cultural, and institutional levels. The hard part is getting people to actually adopt them. Even the best strategies are worthless without implementation. Fairness requires treating people equitably—which may entail treating people differently, but in a way that makes sense. I’ll discuss how to increase commitment to execution in the final section. But before I do, I want to give a specific example of an institutional strategy that works. It comes from Massport, a public organization that owns Boston Logan International Airport and commercial lots worth billions of dollars. When its leaders decided they wanted to increase diversity and inclusion in real estate development in Boston’s booming Seaport District, they decided to leverage their land to do it. Massport’s leaders made formal changes to the selection criteria determining who is awarded lucrative contracts to build and operate hotels and other large commercial buildings on their parcels. In addition to evaluating three traditional criteria—the developer’s experience and financial capital, Massport’s revenue potential, and the project’s architectural design—they added a fourth criterion called “comprehensive diversity and inclusion,” which accounted for 25% of the proposal’s overall score, the same as the other three. This forced developers not only to think more deeply about how to create diversity but also to go out and do it. Similarly, organizations can integrate diversity and inclusion into managers’ scorecards for raises and promotions—if they think it’s important enough. I’ve found that the real barrier to diversity is not figuring out “What can we do?” but rather “Are we willing to do it?” Sacrifice Many organizations that desire greater diversity, equity, and inclusion may not be willing to invest the time, energy, resources, and commitment necessary to make it happen. Actions are often inhibited by the assumption that achieving one desired goal requires sacrificing another desired goal. But that’s not always the case. Although nothing worth having is completely free, racial equity often costs less than people may assume. Seemingly conflicting goals or competing commitments are often relatively easy to reconcile—once the underlying assumptions have been identified. As a society, are we sacrificing public safety and social order when police routinely treat people of color with compassion and respect? No. In fact, it’s possible that kinder policing will actually increase public safety. Famously, the city of Camden, New Jersey, witnessed a 40% drop in violent crime after it reformed its police department, in 2012, and put a much greater emphasis on community policing. The assumptions of sacrifice have enormous implications for the hiring and promotion of diverse talent, for at least two reasons. First, people often assume that increasing diversity means sacrificing principles of fairness and merit, because it requires giving “special” favors to people of color rather than treating everyone the same. But take a look at the scene below. Which of the two scenarios appears more “fair,” the one on the left or the one on the right? People often assume that fairness means treating everyone equally, or exactly the same—in this case, giving each person one crate of the same size. In reality, fairness requires treating people equitably—which may entail treating people differently, but in a way that makes sense. If you chose the scenario on the right, then you subscribe to the notion that fairness can require treating people differently in a sensible way. Of course, what is “sensible” depends on the context and the perceiver. Does it make sense for someone with a physical disability to have a parking space closer to a building? Is it fair for new parents to have six weeks of paid leave to be able to care for their baby? Is it right to allow active-duty military personnel to board an airplane early to express gratitude for their service? My answer is yes to all three questions, but not everyone will agree. For this reason, equity presents a greater challenge to gaining consensus than equality. In the first panel of the fence scenario, everybody gets the same number of crates. That’s a simple solution. But is it fair? In thinking about fairness in the context of American society, leaders must consider the unlevel playing fields and other barriers that exist—provided they are aware of systemic racism. They must also have the courage to make difficult or controversial calls. For example, it might make sense to have an employee resource group for Black employees but not White employees. Fair outcomes may require a process of treating people differently. To be clear, different treatment is not the same as “special” treatment—the latter is tied to favoritism, not equity. There is no test or interview that can invariably identify the “best candidate.” Instead, hire good people and invest in their potential. One leader who understands the difference is Maria Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College. She concluded that the only way to increase the representation of women in computer science was to treat men and women differently. Men and women tended to have different levels of computing experience prior to entering college—different levels of experience, not intelligence or potential. Society treats boys and girls differently throughout secondary school—encouraging STEM subjects for boys but liberal arts subjects for girls, creating gaps in experience. To compensate for this gap created by bias in society, the college designed two introductory computer-science tracks—one for students with no computing experience and one for students with some computing experience in high school. The no-experience course tended to be 50% women whereas the some-experience course was predominantly men. By the end of the semester, the students in both courses were on par with one another. Through this and other equity-based interventions, Klawe and her team were able to dramatically increase the representation of women and minority computer-science majors and graduates. The second assumption many people have is that increasing diversity requires sacrificing high quality and standards. Consider again the fence scenario. All three people have the same height or “potential.” What varies is the level of the field and the fence—apt metaphors for privilege and discrimination, respectively. Because the person on the far left has lower barriers to access, does it make sense to treat the other two people differently to compensate? Do we have an obligation to do so when differences in outcomes are caused by the field and the fence, not someone’s height? Maria Klawe sure thought so. How much human potential is left unrealized within organizations because we do not recognize the barriers that exist?

Caver and Ancella B. Livers HBR, November 2002 Finally, it’s important to understand that quality is difficult to measure with precision. There is no test, instrument, survey, or interviewing technique that will enable you to invariably predict who the “best candidate” will be. The NFL draft illustrates the difficulty in predicting future job performance: Despite large scouting departments, plentiful video of prior performance, and extensive tryouts, almost half of first round picks turn out to be busts. This may be true for organizations as well. Research by Sheldon Zedeck and colleagues on corporate hiring processes has found that even the best screening or aptitude tests predict only 25% of intended outcomes, and that candidate quality is better reflected by “statistical bands” rather than a strict rank ordering. This means that there may be absolutely no difference in quality between the candidate who scored first out of 50 people and the candidate who scored eighth. The big takeaway here is that “sacrifice” may actually involve giving up very little. If we look at people within a band of potential and choose the diverse candidate (for example, number eight) over the top scorer, we haven’t sacrificed quality at all—statistically speaking—even if people’s intuitions lead them to conclude otherwise. Managers should abandon the notion that a “best candidate” must be found. That kind of search amounts to chasing unicorns. Instead, they should focus on hiring well-qualified people who show good promise, and then should invest time, effort, and resources into helping them reach their potential. CONCLUSION The tragedies and protests we have witnessed this year across the United States have increased public awareness and concern about racism as a persistent problem in our society. The question we now must confront is whether, as a nation, we are willing to do the hard work necessary to change widespread attitudes, assumptions, policies, and practices. Unlike society at large, the workplace very often requires contact and cooperation among people from different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, leaders should host open and candid conversations about how their organizations are doing at each of the five stages of the model—and use their power to press for profound and perennial progress.

Managing yourself How to (Actually) Save Time When You’re Working Remotely by Lauren C. Howe , Ashley Whillans and Jochen I. Menges August 24, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary The pandemic has given many of us the opportunity to ditch the commute and work from home long-term, offering huge potential time savings. But to truly reap the benefits of remote work during the current crisis and beyond, we need to think proactively about how we restructure our workday in this new normal. The authors suggest six concrete, research-backed actions you can take today to create clearer work-life boundaries and optimize how you spend your time. MirageC/Getty Images Leer en español In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. While the widespread shift to remote work hasn’t been without its challenges, it does offer a major silver lining: For many of us, commuting has become a thing of the past. In the United States alone, eliminating the daily commute has saved workers around 89 million hours each week — equivalent to time savings of more than 44.5 million full workdays since the pandemic began! These numbers suggest that working remotely could be a deus ex machina for reclaiming one of our most precious and limited resources: time. But despite the potential for staggering time savings, many have struggled to achieve everything they hoped the pandemic would finally make time for: baking sourdough, meditating, or writing the next great literary masterpiece. On the contrary, data we collected from 12,000 people across the U.S. and Europe during the pandemic show that the additional time is often burned on unproductive work and unsatisfying leisure activities. Having more time does not necessarily mean that we use it wisely. So, what are we doing wrong? Lesson #1: Working from home or living at work? Without an office to commute to, the separation between work and home becomes tenuous. Although research shows that people rate their commutes as one of the most stressful and undesirable parts of the day, having no commute at all causes problems too. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share In a series of studies, we found that being on the road can help people switch gears between home and work, and that without a commute, people struggle to separate their work and personal lives. Instead of shutting down the computer and rattling home on a crowded train at 6 PM, many people are working later than ever, “just one more email” stretching into an extra two hours hunched over the laptop. And that additional work time is not always well spent. In our studies, people reported being stuck in more meetings during the pandemic than before, doing too much “agenda-setting,” not doing enough creative collaboration, and filling their time with more unproductive work. In a perfect illustration of Parkinson’s law, that work expands to fill the time available for its completion, the average 53 minutes per day people saved by not commuting was often immediately absorbed by additional, less productive work. Lesson #2: Saving time or wasting time? When people did manage to gain free time, it often wasn’t spent wisely: Our surveys found that activities we call “passive leisure” — such as watching TV — rose dramatically, while “active leisure” activities such as volunteering or socializing became less frequent. While a bit of passive leisure is a healthy way to relax, our research suggests that it’s much less likely than active leisure to promote happiness. Admittedly, the pandemic has made many active leisure activities challenging. But we’ve seen plenty of creative ways to pursue active leisure while following social distancing guidelines, such as Zoom game nights and happy hours, clever socially distant sports, and virtual volunteering. During a time of global crisis, it’s healthy to prioritize relaxation, and it’s natural that we might struggle to maximize productivity at work. But as we return to semi-normalcy, what can we do to ensure we use our time savings to pursue meaningful activities that make us truly happy? Through our research, we found several strategies that can help you structure your workday to enable clearer boundaries and more time for active leisure: 1. Create your own commute. For many of us, commuting was when we would get into “work mode.” But that transition doesn’t have to come from a physical commute. Research shows that the most-desired commute length is 16 minutes, so when you’re working remotely, take that time to find another way to transition into work mode. (We don’t mean literally pretending to be on a subway, as some Londoners have taken to doing.) Specifically, a recent study of ours revealed that the happiest commuters are those who use their commutes to plan their workdays. So try starting your remote workday by taking 15 minutes to plan your day, either at home or with a short morning walk. In fact, walking is a form of active leisure that’s known to reduce stress, so it’s good idea to find ways to deliberately build some walking back into your day. 2. Give yourself a Feierabend. In Germany, the Feierabend is a daily evening celebration marking the moment when work is switched off for the day — often accompanied by a hearty German beer. Whether you finish the day with a beverage, a snack, going for a run, or calling a friend, find a ritual that can mark the end of your workday and give you something to look forward to. These daily routines help you celebrate what you have accomplished during the day (rather than focusing on what still needs to be done), bringing life meaning and happiness. 3. Focus your workload on a daily “must win.” If your to-do list is anything like ours, it is always too long. To avoid drowning in work, identify a must win for each day — one thing you need to achieve no matter what — and then pursue it at full steam. In the face of constant interruptions from email and messaging platforms, staying focused on your top priority is a real accomplishment. And if you complete your must win, research shows the resulting sense of achievement is likely to have a significant impact on your happiness. 4. Put “proactive time” on your calendar. Protect your calendar from never-ending Zoom meetings by blocking out “pro time,” or time reserved for work that is highly important, but not urgent. Our studies have found that scheduling a daily pro-time block, in which you turn off all distractions and focus on specific tasks, helps employees feel more effective and less overwhelmed. Pro-time can prevent you from focusing only on the next deadline and getting bogged down with less meaningful work, making your days feel more productive and less stressful. 5. Reclaim the social in social distancing. The strategies above can help you get some of your time back. But more time in and of itself is meaningless — it’s what you do with it that matters. Are you using your newfound free time to connect with other people? To start exercising, or volunteering? Just like scheduling pro-time during the workday, we recommend being proactive about scheduling active leisure activities after work. This doesn’t have to be a big commitment. Research suggests that short informal social interactions (whether in person or digital), as well as just 10 or 20 minutes of active leisure, boosts well-being. This isn’t about dedicating two hours to socializing every day, but rather spending 20 minutes catching up with a friend or going for a walk. You can even maximize active leisure by combining social time with other pursuits, such as exercising together with a friend. This way you can kill two birds with one stone; plus, involving others in your goals makes it easier to stick to them. In addition, try building social opportunities into the flow of your normal workday. For instance, studies show that using commute time to connect with others — even strangers on a train — promotes happiness. To replicate this while working remotely, perhaps part of your end-of-day routine could be a chat with a family member or friend. 6. Run time-management experiments. Today, we’re all part of a grand experiment in how we use our time. But even after pandemic restrictions are lifted, it’s a good idea to keep trying out new time management schemes to see what works best for you. For example, here at the University of Zurich, our team invented a “3-2-2 week” that gives us a good balance: each week, we spend three days at the office (yes, we think the commute time is worth the conviviality that only the office can afford), two days working from home, and two days dedicated to family and friends. Experiment with structuring your days and weeks in different ways to see what feels best for you, during the pandemic and beyond. Around the world, shifting to remote work could save billions of hours — but it’s up to us to spend that time well. Now is the time to make thoughtful choices about how we reshape work to get more of what we all crave most: time.

Security & privacy Does Your Board Really Understand Your Cyber Risks? by Daniel Dobrygowski and Derek Vadala September 01, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary The methods for measuring cyber risk have evolved in recent years, but they still skew technical and narrow — truly effective cyber ratings must be holistic assessments that consider technical analysis, governance, culture, and the financial impact of adverse cyber events. To bridge the gap, company leaders need to learn how to interpret what the assessments and their underlying components really mean for them. Becoming literate in cyber risk doesn’t mean that every executive needs to be a technical expert, however. What it does mean is that they need to be able to establish their company’s tolerance for cyber risk, define the outcomes that are most important to their business to guide cybersecurity investment, and be able to foster a culture of cybersecurity and resilience. Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images Leer en español Over the past decade, business leaders have had to face an uncomfortable truth: It’s become impossible to sit at the head of a company and not address the threat of cyber risk. Cyber attacks are increasingly pervasive and can present near existential threats to companies, and boards of directors and CEOs need ways to evaluate them, even if they can’t grasp the technical details. This has led to an explosion in the demand for cyber-risk measurements, both inside companies and among external stakeholders. While the methods for measuring cyber risk have evolved in recent years, thanks in part to the efforts of credit-rating agencies, investors, and insurance companies, nothing can replace informed decision-making at the executive level. As cybersecurity experts, we believe that the time has come to not just to develop scores based on third-party evaluations but holistic assessments that consider technical analysis, governance, culture, and the financial impact of adverse cyber events. Such assessments should become a necessary and powerful tool for corporate directors who — if properly trained in interpreting them — could use them to understand their organization’s exposure to technological vulnerabilities. Becoming literate in cyber risk doesn’t mean that all executives need to become technical experts. What it does mean is that they need to be able to establish their company’s tolerance for cyber risk, define the outcomes that are most important in guiding cybersecurity investment, and be able to foster a culture of cybersecurity and resilience. What cyber risk assessments do (and don’t) tell you At its most basic level, a third-party cyber risk assessment shows how well a company has implemented defenses designed to protect it from a cyber attack, whether it is a disruption of its products and services, a breach of its confidential data, or fraud driven by a cyberattack. These assessments also measure how well a company has prepared itself to defend against and recover from such attacks — its cyber resilience. This is a critical component of its broader enterprise risk-management strategy. The risks of weak cyber resilience are abundantly clear: Directors see a near-constant stream of news of network access for sale, factory production being disrupted with a resulting in loss of revenue, fraudulent bank wires, and breaches of customer privacy, all of which create lasting reputational damage for the victim company. During the past decade, the job of understanding and quantifying cyber risk has mainly fallen to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and their teams, who primarily addressed the technical side of the problem. In making their assessments, they have tended to focus on the number of previous attacks, their impact, and how quickly they were addressed. Their goal, in short, has been to take stock of established defenses. The problem with this approach is that it’s largely backward-looking. Assessments sometimes involve looking at Internet-exposed company systems as an attacker might, and trying to determine how vulnerable those systems are to attack. The problem with this approach is that it often doesn’t consider the layered defenses that organizations might have in place, including the efforts to intentionally deceive hackers attempting to study the organization’s weaknesses, and so may reflect a narrower view of risk. The most significant limitation of both of these approaches, however, is that they isolate cybersecurity decisions from the business they are meant to serve. While technical assessments may be sufficient for a CISO’s needs, they do not offer what the board really needs: a risk-oriented, holistic, and validated view of the company that considers the financial and business impacts of cybersecurity (or cyber insecurity) in a given company. Moreover, technical reports don’t adequately capture attributes such as governance, culture, decision-making practices, or wider treatment of a company’s cyber risk profile and appetite, all of which board directors and business executives need to understand if they expect to make informed decisions about whether to allocate capital to improve cyber defenses instead of investing in other areas of the business. How to get the audit you need For an assessment to be useful to directors in a strategic capacity, the board needs to be clear about its requirements — which means it needs to know what to ask for. Rather than accepting a score at face value, or even a qualitative assessment from the company’s technical managers or auditors, directors should ask for a comprehensive assessment: one that moves beyond the technical details and that includes both an outside and inside perspective. At the same time, cybersecurity managers should work with their senior leadership and boards to provide context and use an assessment as a tool for sharing the knowledge the board needs to provide effective oversight. When presented in this way – assembled and shared by a trusted advisor – cyber risk information can be held up against other business risks and similarly weighed against particular strategic opportunities. This won’t create perfect outcomes, but it will vastly improve companies’ understanding of their cyber risk and provide a clear path for evolving oversight as the approaches develop. What does this look like in practice? In order to make appropriate decisions, directors need to understand what “good” means for their overall cyber risk profile, and what a holistic assessment really entails (inside, outside, benchmarked, loss analysis). Additionally, they need to set expectations for an outcome that is commensurate with the company’s goals. Determining what “good” means will vary from company to company. Happily, this means that there’s quite a bit that directors can do in order to ensure that the building blocks are in place so their company can achieve the right outcomes when cyber rating and assessment methodologies mature. Define your risk appetite: The first thing directors should recognize is that the board must determine the company’s risk appetite with regard to cyber-loss events just as it does with any other risk. After developing an understanding of the subject and of what types of risks its company faces, the board will recognize that “perfect” cybersecurity is not attainable. Rather, it will come to appreciate that evaluating cyber risk — and reflecting on any cyber assessment — requires the careful consideration of at least these two main questions: 1) What do our customers expect of us? and 2) How do peer companies approach these risks? Focus on outcomes: Rather than jumping right to a ratings comparison, leaders need to focus on the outcomes they’re trying to achieve. The right outcome is a combination of an organization’s risk appetite, prior and future investment in cybersecurity, and expectation of its customers, shareholders, and even regulators. No one would expect that a brick-and-mortar retailer to have the same cybersecurity program and defenses as a top bank or manufacturer of military equipment. (Consider the situation of a law firm, which needs to worry a lot about a breach of private client data, compared with that of an electric utility, which needs to worry a lot about an interruption in services.) Likewise, boards and business leaders need to calibrate their expectations by determining their appetite for risk and making investments in cybersecurity that are commensurate with their industry profiles. Once this is decided, the board should set internal standards and targets and hold management accountable for meeting them. Establish a culture of cybersecurity and resilience: Governance and culture have a critical part to play in any evaluation of cyber risk. Boards should assert their role in ensuring that these aspects of the company’s cybersecurity program are paramount. While there are currently varying approaches to measuring cyber risk, the right outcome always starts with the right culture. Even as the measurements shift, culture is a driver of all aspects of cyber resilience that can be measured — improvement in technical processes that drive improvement in outside scores, management engagement in cyber relative to business initiatives, engagement of the board in ensuring accountability in objectives. Culture is also important because its indicators fluctuate less over time than technology measures, which tend to shift as trends in computing change. For example, measuring cybersecurity in a data center is dramatically different from measuring cybersecurity in the cloud, but the cultural aspects of whether these environments are effectively managed are similar. *** As the market for cybersecurity assessments further evolves into holistic cyber-security ratings, directors and business leaders need to pay careful attention to ensuring that underlying measurements provide a true comparative benchmark, adequately consider a balance between inside and outside measures, and fully examine the technical, governance, and cultural aspects of an organization. In order to achieve this, transparency in the methodologies used for assessing the risk is vital. But it is also crucial that organizations properly set and manage a cyber-risk appetite, understand the range of financial impacts that applicable cyber events may have on a company, and the role that good, well-informed governance plays in mitigating them.

Performance measurement Research: Knowledge Workers Are More Productive from Home by Julian Birkinshaw , Jordan Cohen and Pawel Stach August 31, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Researchers studied knowledge workers in 2013 and again during the 2020 pandemic lockdown and found significant changes in how they are working. They learned that lockdown helps people focus on the tasks that really matter. They spent 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners. Lockdown also helped people take responsibility for our own schedules. They did 50% more activities through personal choice and half as many because someone else asked them to. Finally, during lockdown, people viewed their work as more worthwhile. The number of tasks rated as tiresome dropped from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others dropped from 41% to 27%.

For many years, we have sought to understand and measure the productivity of knowledge workers, whose inputs and outputs can’t be tracked in the same way as a builder, shelf-stacker, or call center worker. Knowledge workers apply subjective judgment to tasks, they decide what to do when, and they can withhold effort (by not fully engaging their brain) often without anyone noticing. This make attempts to improve their productivity very difficult. In this 2013 HBR article, we presented research showing that knowledge workers spend two-thirds of their time in meetings or doing desk-based work, even though they found these activities mostly tiresome. We proposed some steps people could take to shift time to more worthwhile activities, such as talking to customers or coaching subordinates. Of course, we all get stuck in patterns of activity reinforced by the routines of office life. But, then, in March 2020, the pandemic struck. Suddenly, many of us were sent home and forced to develop new ways of working. After several months, we now have a good sense of how our own day-to-day schedules have changed. But we don’t know how generalizable our experiences are. So we decided to replicate the 2013 study, using the same questions as before and interviewing respondents with similar profiles. Here are the key findings: Lockdown helps us focus on the work that really matters. We are spending 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners. Lockdown helps us take responsibility for our own schedules. We do 50% more activities through personal choice — because we see them as important — and half as many because someone else asked us to. During lockdown, we view our work as more worthwhile. We rate the things we do as valuable to our employer and to ourselves. The number of tasks rated as tiresome drops from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others drops from 41% to 27%. In sum, lockdown has been positive for knowledge worker productivity in the short term. But it has also created some concerns and challenges around longer-term effectiveness, creativity, and personal resilience. Let’s consider the findings from the research in more depth, then discuss what the opportunities and challenges are for the months and years ahead. About the Research Rather than ask people about their general reflections on their work, we asked them to open their calendar and go to a day from the previous week that was typical of their working life. We then asked them to list between six and 10 discrete activities during that day, such as a meeting, a phone call, or a period of time responding to emails. The interviewer asked the respondent to describe briefly what the activity involved, how long it lasted, and who else was involved, and then asked questions about why they’d engaged in that activity and how valuable it was. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share In the 2013 survey we gathered data on 329 specific activities undertaken by 45 knowledge workers. In the 2020 survey, which was conducted in May and early June, we gathered data on 264 activities from 40 individuals. The individuals were selected randomly, subject to a few specific criteria: They had to have at least a bachelor’s degree, five years of full-time work experience, and a job in which effectiveness is determined by the use of brainpower and their capacity to make sound judgments. The age, sector, and experience of the respondents varied. We broke down activities done into six categories: desk-based work (alone), externally facing work (interacting with anyone outside the company), managing down (interacting with subordinates), managing across (interacting with peers and colleagues), managing up (interacting with the boss or someone else senior), and training and development. How Do Knowledge Workers Spend Their Time? In 2013, knowledge workers spent two-thirds of their time either “managing across” in meetings, often with many colleagues, or doing “desk-based work” on their own. Externally focused work (e.g. talking to customers), managing down (coaching and supporting subordinates) and managing up (interacting with the boss and other senior people) all got very little time, while training and personal development got almost none. How has this picture changed during lockdown? There were two significant shifts: 12% less time managing across through meetings and 9% more time doing externally focused work. Desk-based work continues to take a third of our time. Other changes — a little less time managing up and a little more time on training and development — were not statistically significant. Standing back, the evidence suggests lockdown has helped us more effectively prioritize our work. We still need to get through our emails and report-writing. But we are significantly less likely to get drawn into large meetings, and this leaves us more time for client or customer work and for training and development, which most people would argue is a good thing. However, lockdown doesn’t seem to have helped with hierarchy-spanning activities (managing up and down), presumably because it’s impossible to have the short, spontaneous meetings that used to be possible. How Do Knowledge Workers Decide What to Do? While most knowledge workers have a written job description somewhere, it is well understood that they take responsibility for choosing what to do and when to do it based on a variety of factors, including tasks outside of their formal role when it appears sensible to do so. To get a sense for how these decisions are made, we asked study subjects to choose among four options for every activity: It’s a standard part of my job/my boss asked, a peer or colleagues asked me, I did it spontaneously, or it was important and I found time. In 2013, respondents said 52% of their activities were standard, 18% requested by a peer , 24% independent but important, and 3% independent and spontaneous. In 2020, we are still spending half our time on standard activities, but we are doing only 8% because a colleague asked, and a full 35% because we thought the activity was critical. Both these differences were statistically significant. Spontaneity rose to 6% but this difference was not statistically significant. What’s going on here? It seems we have been taking more direct charge of our time during lockdown. Working from home gives us a bit of breathing space: We don’t have colleagues or bosses badgering us, and we don’t get drawn into meetings by force of habit, just because we happen to be around. The result is a reassuring increase in us making time for work that matters most to us. How Effective and Valuable Were These Activities? Finally, we asked respondents about how important and energizing they found each activity. The questions and scores for 2013 and 2020 are summarized in the graphic below. The differences are striking (and all statistically significant). In 2020, respondents say their work is more important, less tiresome, less easily offloaded and contributes to the company’s objectives. Not only is their work important, they feel important as well! Of course, there is some self-justification going on here: When we think our work is important, we are more likely to gain personal utility from it and less prone to delegate it. But it seems there is also some reprioritization occurring, with people stopping some of the less-important activities they used to do and focusing their energy in a more effective way. Overall, the findings here are consistent with the notion that knowledge workers are more intrinsically motivated — and taking more personal ownership — during lockdown, in large part because of the increased degrees of freedom they are getting. Concerns and Challenges Working in lockdown has helped us to focus and to take responsibility. But that’s not the whole story. Follow-up interviews revealed some of the areas of concern that we as individuals — and as leaders of others — need to understand. Some respondents cited the potential for shirking: “I am worried there is some slackening of effort. People are starting to get a bit too comfortable working from home,” said one. In our view, this is not a huge problem: There are many ways of informally monitoring how much time your colleagues are putting in via Outlook, Slack and other tools, and we should really be evaluating knowledge workers on their outputs not their inputs anyway. The bigger areas of concern were around the things people couldn’t do well in a virtual environment. Take managing across first: It’s not so hard for an existing working group to stay on course when working remotely, but the challenges of getting started on something new (the forming/storming stages of team development) or resolving internal conflicts are enormous. Of course, these activities can be done over Zoom – just not as well. Few people are energized by informal online get-togethers. As one person said, “We are slowly losing the social glue that holds us together.” Managing up and down are no less tricky under lockdown. Most respondents had instituted regular one-on-one catch-ups with their teams and bosses, but they usually focused on immediate task and personal well-being issues, rather than longer-term development. They missed the opportunity to bottom out difficult issues: “You cannot challenge a person quite so well over Zoom. You tend to hold back,” said one. They also lamented the loss of growth opportunities for their teams: “I used to throw people into new assignments, where they learned on the job, watching and learning from experienced colleagues. That’s almost impossible to do in a virtual setting.” Finally, some people worried about their own development. While time spent on self-education went up during lockdown, this was mostly due to online webinar and course attendance — which helps build knowledge but doesn’t encourage the active experimentation and personal reflection that help us really grow. For many of us, the new socially distanced mode of working may continue for some time. The good news for knowledge workers from the first phase of this experiment is that lockdown has helped us better manage and prioritize our schedules to favor the most value-added work. The challenge — as we move into the next phase where some face-to-face meetings are allowed — will be to bring back the informal and social elements of office life that are so vital to organizational and individual success.

International business The TikTok Ban Should Worry Every Company by Keman Huang and Stuart Madnick August 28, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary While the proposed U.S. ban of the social media app TikTok may seem novel, it’s actually just the most recent high-profile incident in a string of cases of countries banning products or services over alleged cybersecurity concerns. The authors have studied more than 75 such events involving more than 31 countries going back almost 20 years. They suggest that the current trend should worry any business with an international scope, and suggest that business executives need to not only follow the best practices to improve the cybersecurity of their digital product and services, they must also prepare for political risks. Managers, as well as consumers, may encounter extreme disruptions to international trade. HBR Staff/Unsplash Leer en español Earlier this summer, the U.S. government announced it was considering banning Chinese social media apps, including the popular app TikTok. In August, President Trump signed two executive orders to block transactions with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, and Tencent, which owns the popular messaging service and commercial platform WeChat, and another executive order requiring ByteDance to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business within 90 days, as well as to destroy all its copies of TikTok data attached to U.S. users. As companies including Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle have expressed interest in buying the app, TikTok is suing the U.S. government, accusing the Trump administration of depriving it of due process. The proposed ban, according to the Trump administration, is intended to safeguard the privacy of U.S. citizens and shield data about them — and government officials — from the Chinese government. Trump’s August 6 executive order claims TikTok could “allow China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” But, is TikTok really a threat? And if it is, what are the possible consequences of these actions by the U.S.? As researchers who have studied similar bans on technologies, we believe that this chain of events could have sweeping impacts on the business community, which will likely not be confined to the tech sector. What Is the Threat? If data collection by a company with overseas connections comprises a threat, there are threats all around. The data that TikTok collects pales in comparison to, say, what most American tech companies (as well as banks, credit agencies, and hotels) collect, both visibly and less so. Many institutions that collect sensitive data have already been hacked — it is estimated that there is a cyber attack every 39 seconds — and much of that information is for sale on the Dark Web. If the Chinese government wanted the kind of information TikTok could collect, it could be obtained in many other ways. What will likely prove a more pressing threat to U.S. customers is much more low-tech: Setting a precedent of banning everyday technologies could quickly spiral out of control and seriously disrupt almost all international trade. A Growing Trend While the case against TikTok may seem novel, it’s actually just the most recent high-profile incident in a string of cases of countries banning products or services over alleged cybersecurity concerns. In our research, we have studied more than 75 such events involving more than 31 countries going back almost 20 years, though most occurred in the past five years. For example, in 2017, Germany banned My Friend Carly — a doll from the U.S. that you could talk to you — because the conversation was processed by servers in the U.S. In 2016, Russia blocked access to LinkedIn, stating that LinkedIn refused to store personal data of Russian users in Russia. In 2017 U.S. blocked the Russian security company Kaspersky over its alleged ties to the Russian government. These cases build on a trend of high-profile bans, such as when China blocked Facebook, Twitter, and Google (2009), and when BlackBerry was banned or threatened with a ban in India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (2010). Because any product that contains a computer or service that uses a computer — nowadays just about everything — can introduce cybersecurity risks, the frequency and impact of these events is increasing. (My electronic toothbrush has a computer in it and is connected to the Internet.) Examining the millions of lines of software or firmware in these products and services is not currently feasible, therefore decisions are made based on the perceived risks, which can be impacted by factors such as trust and capability to manage cybersecurity risks. There have been restrictions imposed on products and services as diverse as: medical devices, videoconference services, software products, security software, social media, security cameras, banking IT systems, drones, smartphones, smart toys, online content services, satellite communications, AI software, and financial services such as international fund transfers and payment systems. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Digital Trade Service Restrictiveness Index, 13 of the 46 majority economies have increased their digital trade restrictions between 2014 and 2019, while only four countries reduced their restrictions. In general, there are four strategies for managing risks: accept, avoid, mitigate, and transfer. There are many practical options that countries and companies can adopt to manage cybersecurity risks from cross-border digital products/services. Unfortunately, banning products is becoming increasingly common — and doesn’t appear to be a particularly sustainable strategy. Why This Time Is Different The proposed ban reinforces a growing belief that America is no longer the leading guarantor of global business, but rather a potential threat to it — a notion that is profoundly reshaping the world economy and threatening American businesses. TikTok and WeChat both have massive user bases (800 million and close to 1.2 billion, respectively). Removing WeChat from the Apple Store could cause Apple’s iPhone sales to fall by around 30% according to one prominent analyst. In an August call with White House officials, more than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns that banning WeChat could undermine their competitiveness in the Chinese market. The second-order cost of sabotaging the international business environment with these policies could be much higher: 86% of companies in the U.S.-China Business Council have reported experiencing negative impacts on their business with China. The biggest impact was lost sales because customers shift their suppliers or sourcing due to uncertainty of continued supply. Companies worried about a U.S. ban may just initiate a “De-Americanization” plan to remove or replace U.S. components in their products and supply chains. For example, in February 2019, WorldFirst, a U.K-based international money transfer service that many big Amazon sellers relied on, closed its U.S. business as a precursor to its acquisition by Chinese-based Ant Financial. This was considered the only way to avoid U.S. regulators blocking the deal over national security concerns. On the other hand, the Chinese company Hikvision found alternatives to most of its U.S. components so that being added to the U.S. trade blacklist had a limited impact on its business. Weighing the Political Risks Business executives need to realize that in addition to following the best practices to reduce the perceived cybersecurity risks from their digital product/services, preparing for political risks is also necessary. TikTok implemented several practices to mitigate the risks, including: storing U.S. user data in the U.S. and backing it up on Singaporean servers, blocking access to its data from its mother company ByteDance, hiring an American CEO and operations team, beefing up its lobbying team, withdrawing from Hong Kong based on the concerns over China’s new national security law, launching a “transparency center” for moderation and data practices in Los Angeles, banning political and advocacy advertising from its platform, and setting up a global headquarters outside of China. TikTok and its employees are preparing to battle the ban in separate lawsuits. Though these practices have not yet helped TikTok to void the ban, they will probably be major arguments in its lawsuit against the U.S. Furthermore, these practices may be important directions that all companies might need to follow for doing international business in the new normal to address concerns over cybersecurity risks. In reality, banning is more likely to increase — not reduce — risk, because it builds up distrust among countries and companies. Other countries may retaliate by banning U.S. companies and the situation could rapidly spiral. In recent years, governments have tried to increase their ability to access the data contained on these devices and services. For example, WhatsApp advertises that it “secures your conversations with end-to-end encryption, which means your messages and status updates stay between you and the people you choose.” But, several times, most recently in October 2019, the U.S., UK and Australia have applied pressure on Facebook to create backdoors that would allow access to encrypted message content. So far, Facebook and WhatsApp have refused. If such backdoors are allowed and become commonplace, then every Internet-connected device will essentially be a spy device and likely be banned by every other country. The abuse of “national security threat” is snowballing and leading to an escalating trade war that could disrupt world trade. We saw a similar situation caused by the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs in the 1930s. The goal was to protect U.S. farmers and other industries that were suffering during the Great Depression by raising tariffs and discouraging import of products from other countries. But, not surprisingly, almost all of the U.S. trade partners retaliated and raised their tariffs. That resulted in U.S. imports decreasing 66% and exports decreasing 61% making the “Great Depression” much greater. In general, there are rarely winners in trade wars, and probably not in cyber trade wars.

Our company had only 20 people in a single office in Toronto, where we produced reports on 300 companies, most of them Canadian firms traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Today we have 650 people based in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia providing ESG research, ratings, and data on tens of thousands of companies. And we’re not alone: A handful of other big rating firms, along with dozens more smaller organizations, distribute some sustainability data. What has changed even more than the size of our team and the volume of research we produce is the way ratings like ours are used. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the use of ESG information in the investment process. A decade ago this information was of interest to a relatively small segment of the investment community. Today nearly all large institutional investors utilize ESG research to some degree. That’s because recognition is growing that this data has real value and can drive better investment outcomes—not in every case, but in enough cases to make a material difference to investors. Furthermore, while ESG factors can affect a company’s bottom line directly, they also affect a company’s reputation, and business leaders and investors are recognizing the potential costs of not managing firms’ ESG risks. Creating the ratings is challenging work. There are no uniform requirements for reporting ESG information, and many environmental and social impacts are hard to measure. So the data inputs that we start with are fundamentally less structured, less complete, and of lower quality than financial data, which companies are required to present in standardized form and have audited by accountants. The lack of rules and robust metrics makes our job more difficult—but also more valuable. Because we’re compiling data and generating insights that many investors have not used in the past and don’t have easy access to, very often this information is not priced into stocks. It is important to us that the companies we assess understand how we arrive at our ratings. We consider two elements: what risks the businesses are exposed to and how well they’re managing them. We classify each company into one of 138 industries, and we have a list of relevant risks for each. For instance, a mining enterprise will typically face risks related to carbon and noncarbon emissions, environmental management systems, water use, occupational health and safety, and corporate governance, among other matters. To ascertain its risk exposure, we look at the specifics of its business. Suppose the company operates in jurisdictions where complicity in bribery and corruption is common or where managing community and labor relations is especially challenging. It faces more risks than do competitors that avoid such jurisdictions, so we’d adjust its risk exposure upward. A big part of our work is calibrating the degree of ESG risk that firms face. The next step in rating a company is to assess how well it is managing its risk exposure. This involves looking at the types of programs, policies, and management practices the company uses and its preparedness to avoid or mitigate certain risks. If we don’t have evidence that the company is adequately prepared, it gets a lower score. Firms that do have appropriate risk-handling measures in place should disclose what they are doing, to ensure that those measures are taken into account. Levels of disclosure have increased tremendously in recent years, but they’re still not as high as we’d like them to be. The way companies engage with us throughout the rating process varies quite a bit. A decade ago only 10% of firms responded to our requests and talked with us about our analysis. Today more than 60% of large companies share information with us, and that number has been growing each year. In general, businesses that take special pride in their reputation and those that have an ESG-minded investor base are willing to spend more time communicating with us. In other cases, companies that fare poorly in our ratings or are facing criticism of their sustainability or governance practices are encouraged by their investors to interact with us. Sometimes business leaders complain about “survey fatigue” and say they are hearing from too many ratings firms that request too much information. I empathize with that. Various international organizations are working to standardize ESG reporting, which will make it less onerous for company managers. Regardless, I believe it’s worth their time to engage more deeply with the firms that, like ours, have the biggest presence in the market. Once we have completed our ratings process, we send the profile to the company for feedback. During those conversations, we’re looking for any additional information or clarification that can enhance our analysis. New information doesn’t always lead to a change in our rating, but we do listen. As ESG rating outcomes become more important, we certainly hear from people inside firms who forcefully argue for their point of view. Today nearly all large institutional investors use ESG research to some degree. Companies often see their ratings move if they begin addressing sustainability issues in new ways or if a significant ESG controversy arises, which can indicate a management gap. However, some of the more dramatic improvements result from changes to risk exposure when companies embark on a strategic shift in their operations or business model. For instance, the Danish power company Ørsted (formerly known as Danske Olie og Naturgas) used to be involved in oil and gas exploration and production. In 2017, however, it sold its oil and gas assets and invested heavily in renewables; it’s now one of the world’s largest players in the offshore wind sector. The company still has some coal-fired power plants, but it has announced aggressive plans to phase them out. From 2018 to 2019 its risk rating score improved markedly. Companies’ ESG risk exposure can also move in a negative direction. For example, Facebook’s ESG ratings have fallen because of increased public alarm about the company’s handling of data privacy and security. Similarly, Amazon has seen its ESG scores decline in the wake of growing antitrust scrutiny and concern over workplace conditions for its employees. Peugeot, the French carmaker, has experienced a decline in its ESG ratings since its 2017 acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, which make less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result of the acquisition, Peugeot will most likely miss the European Union’s 2021 target for CO2 emissions, potentially exposing it to fines of several hundred million euros. For companies that want to put their best foot forward, good disclosure of their most material ESG challenges—and how they’re addressing them—goes far. The best way to improve disclosure is to issue a sustainability report that has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards. When companies invest the time to produce a thorough report, our analysis is easier and the amount of time it takes to talk with us and the other ESG ratings firms goes down quite a bit. But the most important part of the process happens when companies scrutinize their business and their business model to understand which issues are most material in terms of ESG risk. Reducing their risk exposure or finding a better way to manage the risk typically results in the greatest benefits for the company and its investors, as well as for the environment and society. The amount of analytical rigor that goes into ESG ratings has increased substantially, and that’s a good thing. These ratings are more relevant and more high-profile than ever before, and investors are paying closer attention. A poor rating draws more scrutiny to a company, and a strong rating can increase investment flows. That’s part of what makes this work so interesting. Social-Impact Efforts That Create Real Value George Serafeim Save Share Idea in Brief The Situation Many CEOs feel as if they’re doing everything that’s asked of them in terms of improving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Yet their firms aren’t being rewarded by capital markets. The Insight Following the crowd on ESG activities is not the answer. To gain a competitive advantage, firms should instead focus on the ESG issues that are financially material for them and pursue those in distinctive ways. The Actions Management should take five steps: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors. Until the mid-2010s few investors paid attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data—information about companies’ carbon footprints, labor policies, board makeup, and so forth. Today the data is widely used by investors. Some screen out poor ESG performers, assuming that the factors that cause companies to receive low ESG ratings will result in weak financial results. Some seek out high ESG performers, expecting exemplary ESG behaviors to drive superior financial results, or wishing, for ethical reasons, to invest only in “green funds.” Other investors incorporate ESG data into fundamental analysis. And some use the data as activists, investing and then urging companies to clean up their acts. It’s an open question whether ESG issues will remain as salient to investors during a global pandemic and the associated economic downturn—but my bet is that they will. That’s because companies are likely to be more resilient in the face of unexpected shocks and hardships if they are managed for the long term and in line with societal megatrends, such as inclusion and climate change. Indeed, in the opening weeks of global bear markets following the spread of Covid-19, most ESG funds outperformed their benchmarks. And when colleagues and I looked at data for more than 3,000 firms between late February and late March 2020—when global financial markets were collapsing—we found that the ones the public perceived as behaving more responsibly had less-negative stock returns than their competitors. I believe that longer term, the crisis is likely to increase awareness that companies must consider societal needs, not just short-term profits. The recent prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement, too, is creating a groundswell of support for strong diversity policies and fair employment practices. It seems clear that companies will be under growing pressure to improve their performance on ESG dimensions in the future. The challenge for many corporate leaders is that they aren’t sure how to do that. They lack understanding of exactly where they should be focusing their attention and how they should be communicating their ESG efforts. Many executives incorrectly believe that simple actions will suffice: improving ESG disclosures, releasing a sustainability report, or holding a sustainability-focused investor relations event. Some companies take those actions, fail to see a benefit, and grow disappointed or frustrated. In some cases they face criticism and negative reactions from investors. It’s easy to see why this has happened. Too many companies have embraced a “box-ticking” culture that encourages the adoption of increasingly standardized ESG activities, many of them created by analysts and consultants who rely on industry benchmarks and best practices. Those activities may well be good for society and the bottom line. Firms reap clear benefits in the form of operational efficiencies: After all, ESG measures such as reducing waste, strengthening relationships with external stakeholders, and improving risk management and compliance are good business hygiene. In many industries such efforts are now table stakes for enterprises wishing to remain competitive. But they’re not enough. Companies must move beyond box checking and window dressing. In a world that increasingly judges them on their ESG performance, they must look to more-fundamental drivers—particularly strategy—to achieve real results and be rewarded for them. Over the past two decades various colleagues and I have analyzed more than 10,000 companies, conducting 30 field studies and publishing more than 15 empirical papers. Our collective research points to the need for a new management paradigm for corporate leaders—one in which ESG considerations are embedded in both strategy and operations. In this article I describe a five-pronged approach to help companies achieve superior performance through attention to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance. Pursuing this work isn’t about ESG ratings per se—it’s about using ESG integration to create new forms of competitive advantage. And since it involves fundamental strategic and operational choices, it can’t be left entirely to the investor relations team or the sustainability department. Instead it must be a priority for the CEO and top executives and become central to the firm’s culture. Why ESG Issues Matter The most fundamental reason to try to raise your company’s ESG performance is that all human beings—in and out of corporate settings—have an obligation to behave in prosocial ways. But apart from the moral case, there are very real payoffs for focusing on ESG issues. And those extend beyond the benefits companies might enjoy because of productivity increases due to higher employee engagement, or sales increases due to more loyal and satisfied customers. First, an ESG focus can help management reduce capital costs and improve the firm’s valuation. That’s because as more investors look to put money into companies with stronger ESG performance, larger pools of capital will be available to those companies. My research colleagues and I have found this happening not only in equity markets but also in loan markets, where some banks are linking interest rates on loans to ESG performance. ING, for example, did just that in 2017 when it made a $1.2 billion loan to Philips, an innovator in health technology and consumer products. Second, positive action and transparency on ESG matters can help companies protect their valuations as more global regulators and governments mandate ESG disclosures. My research with Jody Grewal of the University of Toronto and Edward Riedl of Boston University showed that after the European Union announced broader disclosure requirements, the stock market reacted positively to firms with strong ESG disclosure and negatively to those with weak disclosure. And it’s not only developed countries that are adopting and enforcing disclosure regulations; so are many emerging markets, including South Africa, Brazil, India, and China. Many companies incorrectly believe that simple ESG actions will suffice. Third, efforts to ensure sustainable practices will help maintain shareholder satisfaction with board leadership. As more investors with more assets under management commit to ESG investing, they will have more voting power to effect changes. Shareholders in a growing number of companies have already put forward proposals to improve gender diversity on the boards, garnering a level of support that was unimaginable even 10 years ago. For example, nearly 63% of voting shareholders at Cognex, a maker of machine vision products, approved a proposal to diversify the board, while a similar measure at the real estate company Hudson Pacific Properties received 85% support. To avoid votes against directors, challenges to executive-pay initiatives, and the like, management needs to be proactive about addressing ESG issues. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, ESG practices are part of long-term strategy, and every company needs investors who support management’s vision and plans for the future. When Paul Polman became the CEO of Unilever, then an underperforming consumer goods giant, he immediately ended quarterly earnings guidance and was explicit about his commitment to long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. That led to an exodus of short-term-focused investors, thereby attracting more-patient capital. So how can companies get ahead of the trends and realize tangible financial benefits from their ESG programs? In my experience studying and advising companies with strong programs, I have identified five actions that management can take: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors. A Strategic ESG Program To date, most companies have been treating ESG efforts like a cell phone case—something added for protection (in this case, protection of the firm’s reputation). Corporate leaders need to replace this mentality with an ambitious and differentiated ESG strategy if they want to see real financial dividends. In his seminal article “What Is Strategy?” (HBR, November–December 1996), Michael Porter draws a distinction between operational effectiveness and strategy. The former, he writes, “means performing similar activities better than rivals”; the latter “is about being different.” Following Porter’s distinction, an ESG program may deliver efficiencies and other operational improvements—maybe even some that are necessary for corporate survival—but it will boost long-term financial performance only if it provides strategic differentiation from competitors. For example, some companies implement environmental-, water-, or waste-management systems in order to operate more efficiently. Although such systems would be included in ESG ratings, few if any companies would expect to establish a competitive advantage simply by adopting them. Typically, competitors can quickly follow suit and acquire similar systems. My research with Ioannis Ioannou of London Business School suggests that this is indeed what has happened. Analyzing data from close to 4,000 companies globally, we found that within most industries, ESG practices converged over the eight years from 2012 through 2019. In other words, firms are increasingly engaging in the same sorts of sustainability and governance activities—and thus failing to differentiate themselves strategically. Marlies Plank To outperform their competitors, companies need to find approaches that are more difficult to imitate. In our study we identified the ESG activities in each industry that have become widespread, which we termed common practices, and those that have not, which we termed strategic. As an example of the latter, think of Airbnb’s creation of a peer-to-peer network and a “circular economy” business model (one involving the reuse of existing assets), or Google’s unconventional approach to employee recruitment, engagement, and retention. Those distinctive practices have helped Airbnb and Google occupy competitive positions that cannot be easily replicated—and the companies have been rewarded by capital markets as a result. Indeed, our research confirms that the adoption of strategic ESG practices is significantly and positively associated with both return on capital and market valuation multiples, even after accounting for a firm’s past financial performance. So how can companies identify strategic ESG initiatives? As with any strategy, the way to start is by determining where to play and how to win. The former is particularly vital because not all ESG issues are created equal—some matter more, depending on the industry. In the energy and transportation sectors, for instance, investing to make the transition to a low-carbon economy is becoming increasingly important, affecting companies’ costs and margins. In the technology sector, however, carbon-footprint reduction is not as relevant as building a diverse organization, which can bolster a brand’s reputation and lead to increased revenue. My research with Aaron Yoon of Northwestern University and Mozaffar Khan, a former colleague at HBS, has shown that targeting the right issues brings financial benefits: In analyzing the performance of more than 2,000 U.S. companies over 21 years, we found that those firms that improved on material ESG issues significantly outperformed their competitors. (Materiality was identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, which offers a list of salient issues for 77 industries. I served as an unpaid member of SASB’s Standards Council from 2012 to 2014.) Interestingly, companies that outperformed on immaterial ESG issues slightly underperformed their competitors. This suggests that investors are becoming sophisticated enough to tell the difference between greenwashing and value creation. Of course, materiality is not a static concept. The strategic challenge for corporate leaders is to be foresighted about the ESG themes that are emerging as important industry drivers—to identify them before their competitors do (and in some cases ahead of SASB too). This requires leaders to conceptualize the various actors in the system, their incentives, and the interventions that could drive change. Although that may sound straightforward, it is not. But my research with Jean Rogers, the founder and former CEO of SASB, revealed that an ESG issue is likely to become financially material under certain conditions: when it becomes easier for management and external stakeholders to gain insight into a company’s environmental or social impact (consider how technological advances now make it possible to trace the raw materials in electronic products and discern those that have been unsustainably mined) when the media and NGOs have more power and politicians are more responsive to it (such scenarios have prompted the creation and enforcement of anticorruption laws and other new regulations) when companies lack the ability to effectively self-regulate (for instance, this is the case in the palm oil industry, where a misalignment of incentives for farmers leads to deforestation) when a company develops a differentiated service or product that replaces a “dirty” or unsustainable way of doing business (think of Tesla, with its potential to disrupt the market for gasoline-powered cars) IKEA is one company that has mapped out a strategic ESG program, transforming itself in response to accelerating environmental degradation. It has introduced various product, service, and process innovations to move away from its traditional retailing of inexpensive furniture that customers often discard quickly. It recently entered the home solar and energy-storage business, which grew by 29% in 2019. And while most competitors are focusing on using materials more efficiently or trying to find ways to recycle products after they have been designed, IKEA has launched an effort to completely rethink product design. The aim is to create products that can be reused, refurbished, remanufactured, or recycled, thereby extending their lifespan. Moreover, IKEA products will be modularized to make them easy to dismantle and reuse as raw materials when they’re no longer functional. Although this process will take years, the firm will most likely emerge as a circular-economy leader as more regulatory, consumer, and brand pressures force companies to compete on products with better environmental credentials. While IKEA’s strategy involves moving away from wasteful practices, other firms have found that strategic reviews can identify ways to differentiate by leaning in to positive impact. When senior leaders at Vaseline interviewed medical professionals at the Centers for Disease Control, Doctors Without Borders, and the UN Refugee Agency, they learned that Vaseline jelly was an indispensable part of emergency first-aid kits, particularly in developing countries. They also learned that preventable skin conditions, such as deeply cracked hands and burns from cooking on gas stoves or using kerosene lamps, were keeping people from working, going to school, and engaging in other basic activities—a situation that Vaseline could help alleviate. That insight led to a new social-impact strategy to help heal the skin of 5 million people living in crisis or conflict. The strategy connected business goals with societal needs and differentiated the brand from competitors while increasing revenue. Accountability Mechanisms The implementation of an ESG strategy involves large operational and strategic changes. It must start at the top with the board and be diffused through the entire organization. (See “The Board’s Role in Sustainability” in this package.) Yet my research shows that in most companies the board of directors is far removed from the firm’s ESG efforts. This is a mistake. The board should be the entity that ensures that ESG metrics are properly considered in executive compensation and are adequately measured and disclosed as part of the audit committee’s work. Indeed, my colleagues and I have found that one of the characteristics of organizations with high ESG performance is a process that deeply embeds ESG issues in the board’s work and in executive pay. Although most large global companies say that their boards oversee sustainability, that generally happens in a piecemeal fashion. There are exceptions. BNP Paribas is a global financial company taking a systematic approach to sustainability governance. The company has directors who are active participants in sustainable-finance forums, including a chair who was formerly the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Large polluters, such as BHP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Eskom, have linked executive incentives to their carbon emissions, motivating management to act as it faces increased risk of regulation and competition from new technologies. Microsoft and other technology firms have tied executive compensation to workforce diversity targets, an ESG issue that’s critical for an industry in which competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas, and creative thinking. The Power of Purpose A top-down approach to sustainability and good governance is not effective if it is not supported from the bottom up by a culture that rallies around ESG initiatives. Many strategic efforts fail because people further down in the organizational hierarchy don’t believe there is a true commitment to ESG goals or they lack clear direction for achieving them. Skepticism, even cynicism, leads such efforts to be sidelined or inconsistently implemented across functions, divisions, and business lines. To remedy this problem, organizations must identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it. When Claudine Gartenberg of the Wharton School, Andrea Prat of Columbia University, and I analyzed data from more than 1,000 U.S. companies and 1.5 million employees, we found that clarity about a sense of purpose declines from senior management to middle management and then to lower-level employees. We also found that firms able to flatten the hierarchy and diffuse a sense of purpose through the ranks outperformed their competitors. In recent years a lot has been written about purpose, but not much consensus exists about what the term actually means. The most high-profile articulation of the concept came from Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world. He wrote that “a company cannot achieve long-term profits without embracing purpose” because “a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to stakeholders helps a company connect more deeply to its customers and adjust to the changing demands of society.” In August 2019, CEOs from 181 of the world’s largest companies—as part of the lobbying group Business Roundtable (BRT)—modified a position that the group had held since 1977 by declaring that the purpose of a corporation is not just to serve shareholders but to create value for all stakeholders. Neither Fink’s nor BRT’s assertion explains exactly what purpose is, of course. But we definitely know what it is not: words you see on a wall when you enter company headquarters, mission statements posted on websites, or grandiose speeches by CEOs in town halls. Research has shown those to be “cheap talk” that is unrelated to real outcomes in the organization. My colleagues and I have defined purpose as how employees—the people who know the organization best—perceive the meaning and impact of their work. To measure employees’ sense of purpose in three of our recent studies, we used questions from surveys by the Great Place to Work Institute, asking participants to rate their level of agreement with statements such as “My work has special meaning; it’s not just a job,” “I feel proud of the ways that we contribute to the community,” and “Management has a clear view of where the organization is going and how to get there.” Investors seem to be paying increasing attention to companies that are effective at linking strategy to purpose. The Strategic Investor Initiative, an outgrowth of the Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose coalition, recently collaborated with KKS Advisors (which I cofounded) to analyze 20 CEO presentations on long-term strategic plans. We found that when CEOs did well at communicating corporate purpose, stock prices and trade volume rose in the following days. The implication is that investors find value in information about purpose. In one of the presentations we studied, Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck, told shareholders: “Our purpose is very clear to us and all of our people, and that is to discover and develop lifesaving medicines for society.” He added, “That’s what makes our people come to work every day. It’s what makes them make the tremendous commitment that gives them the willingness to make the discretionary effort.” For some companies, defining their purpose means leaving money on the table, at least in the short term. This is the case with automakers that are transitioning away from carbon-emitting gas-powered cars and moving toward electric vehicles, which are more eco-friendly but less profitable. The good news, though, is that we’re seeing more examples proving that a long-term trade-off between profits and sustainability is not necessary, given that companies can redesign how they generate revenue. Consider Philips Lighting, which has shifted from selling light bulb products with limited lifespans to selling lighting as a sustainable service. Customers pay for the light they use rather than investing in the physical assets, while Philips retains ownership of all lighting equipment and takes it back when it’s suitable for recycling or upgrading. Investors find value in information about purpose. Commitment to a purpose will also push companies to sometimes undertake initiatives that might not pencil out in P&L terms. Frazier described such an initiative when he spoke about Merck’s effort to develop an Ebola vaccine: “It would have been impossible to say…‘We won’t go there, because we don’t see a robust commercial market.’ And I think that’s part of what [we are] talking about in terms of having a purpose-driven organization.” As more companies work to articulate their purpose and build a culture that fully embraces it, we will learn more about what ensures success. However, my research with Gartenberg already points to three key conditions: an intentional strategy to grow leaders within the organization, resulting in the promotion of internal candidates to the CEO role; fair compensation structures (in which the ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is not extreme for the industry); and careful execution of mergers and acquisitions to avoid culture clashes. Though the reasons aren’t fully understood, the research suggests that externally hired CEOs and companies with more acquisitions need to work harder to create a sense of purpose. Operational Changes In studying firms that have successfully implemented an ESG strategy, I’ve noticed that they tend to pass through three phases: efforts to reduce risk and ensure compliance with environmental regulations and other laws; efforts to improve operating efficiency; and efforts to innovate and grow. To achieve this evolution, exemplary firms usually start by centralizing ESG activities, which is helpful for moving from a focus on risk and compliance to a focus on operating efficiency. But to reach the innovation and growth stage, companies need to decentralize ESG activities and empower corporate functions to take responsibility for them. This is true in terms of distributing power from the C-suite to middle management, but it’s also true at the board level. Initially a board needs to set up a separate sustainability committee. But at the third stage it will typically reallocate responsibilities to preexisting board committees (audit, nomination, and so forth). Of course, decentralization requires appropriate support mechanisms. For example, the chemicals company Solvay developed a tool to assess the environmental impact of each of its product applications. This has enabled decision-makers in separate functions to take environmental considerations into account when discharging their respective responsibilities—for apportioning the R&D budget, underwriting risks during the due diligence phase of acquisitions, or optimizing plant manufacturing operations as regulations change. From 2016 to 2018 Solvay saw 4% annual growth in sales of products that have low environmental impact, while sales of more-damaging products declined by 5%. As the ESG field continues to mature, investors will be looking at how organizations are structured to deliver on their stated purpose. To increase the odds of success, winning companies will make sure that the people who manage the most important determinants of ESG performance have the capabilities and resources needed to get the job done. A first step is to ensure that the chief sustainability officer, or the senior executive charged with ESG responsibilities, is the person closest to the company’s most material ESG issues. If brands are critical assets (as they are for consumer goods companies), this individual might be the chief marketing or chief brand officer. If risk management is a central concern for the enterprise (as is the case for financial institutions), this person could be the chief risk or chief investment officer. If human capital issues matter most, the responsibility for ESG activities might fall to the head of human resources. At Tyson Foods, the former chief sustainability officer also served as the executive vice president of corporate strategy and led continuous-improvement efforts. Additionally, he managed Tyson’s venture fund, which is investing in plant-based protein and cultured meat as more-sustainable alternatives to traditional meat products. Marlies Plank About the art: Marlies Plank is fascinated by the surreal effect of large soap bubbles floating through landscapes. She has photographed around the world, in locations such as Austria, Morocco, Spain, Italy, and Slovenia. Goal setting can be useful in helping companies progress from centralization to decentralization of ESG activities. Although top leaders should set ESG targets, unit heads and middle management should be empowered to figure out how to hit them. Paradoxically, audacious targets are more likely to be met than modest ones are. That was the finding that emerged when Ioannou and I, along with Shelley Xin Li of the University of Southern California, analyzed more than 800 corporate targets related to climate change. And a separate study—one I did with Grewal and my Harvard Business School colleague David Freiberg—confirmed the benefits of aiming high: We looked at more than 1,000 firms and discovered that those with relatively ambitious targets relating to climate change invested more than their peers, made significant operating changes, and, in the process, drove innovation. Communicate with the (Right) Investors Companies must avoid slavishly focusing on improving their ESG ratings, but communication with the investor community is nevertheless important. Often, however, decisions about what to measure and how to keep investors informed are clouded by misconceptions. The first is the belief among many corporate leaders that a firm’s investor base is not subject to influence or control by management. In reality, a company can influence who buys its stock and, if necessary, change the base of shareholders. It’s not as easy as shaping one’s customer or employee base, but it’s possible. For example, before Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, it significantly altered its investor base from 2006 to 2012 by committing to integrating financially material ESG issues into its strategy and reporting on them to its shareholders. Dedicated long-term investors (including Aviva Investors, Scottish Widows, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund) initially owned a small fraction of Shire’s stock, but their holdings increased steadily and eventually became greater than those of transient investors—a highly uncommon phenomenon for a publicly listed company. The second misconception is that the demands of sell-side analysts employed by big brokerage houses should determine what must be communicated. Most companies still emphasize mostly short-term information in their investor communications. That’s because they view the sell side as the traditional “customer” of investor relations. That needs to change; the focus should be on communicating directly with the buy side—the large institutional asset managers that hold the company’s stock. Some companies are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting. The third misconception is that ESG metrics are sufficient for investors to integrate ESG considerations into their business analysis, valuation, and modeling. In fact, investors struggle to embed those metrics in financial models because it’s not clear what they mean or how they can affect the financials. One solution might be the creation of a system of impact-weighted accounting that could measure a firm’s environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), convert them to monetary terms, and then reflect them in financial statements. Though the science to do this has yet to be perfected, such a system holds great promise for three reasons: It would translate impacts into units of measurement that business managers and investors understand; it would allow for the use of financial and business analysis tools to consider those impacts; and it would enable an aggregation and comparison of analyses across types of impact that would not be possible without standardized units of measurement. At the Impact-Weighted Accounts Initiative (a Harvard Business School project that I lead), we are collaborating with the Global Steering Group for Impact Investing and the Impact Management Project on a simple approach: adjusting traditional accounting measures to consider the various types of impact that ESG actions might have. These include product impact, which affects revenue numbers; employment impact, which affects employee expenditures on the income statement; and environmental impact, which affects the cost of goods sold. For example, positive product impact could mean more revenue for a company and potentially higher growth. Positive employment impact (measured by, say, resources spent on employee training) would send investors a strong signal that management views employee expenditures as investments that lead to future profitability and not merely as expenses. Negative environmental impact might raise the cost of goods sold, by triggering new and restrictive regulations. Valuing a company’s effects on people and the planet—and integrating that into traditional financial analysis—will offer a more comprehensive picture of actual corporate performance. Some companies, such as the science-oriented DSM and the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting. Novartis estimated its employment impact for 2017—including benefits derived from employee development, occupational safety efforts, and payment of a living wage—at $7 billion. Its environmental impact, as measured by carbon emissions and water and waste impacts, was calculated at $4.7 billion. Positive product impact, something that has been largely missing from most ESG investment frameworks, was estimated at $72 billion. A final, fundamental misconception about investor relations is the idea that ESG disclosure is transaction-based and can happen intermittently. Companies need to instead see it as an opportunity for continual reputation and relationship building. It used to be that most communication with investors (the buy side) was happening through Wall Street analysts (the sell side). Increasingly, investors want a direct line of communication, and they appreciate proactive information sharing, which has the added benefit of extending investor patience. Performance declines may occur. But if CEOs come to investors with an excuse after the fact, without having built trust, they are unlikely to be given the leeway or the time they need to reverse the decline. The Path Forward Many companies have failed to recognize that the functional role of ESG data has changed over time. Initially such data was used to judge a company’s willingness to avoid harm and do good. As a result, it was primarily an input to help form policies that signaled a firm’s commitment to achieving positive outcomes for the environment and society. However, investors are increasingly asking a different question: not whether a company has good intentions but whether it has the strategic vision and capabilities to achieve and maintain strong ESG performance. That means companies need to start measuring and reporting the results of their initiatives. Instead of communicating their policies for improving data privacy, water management, climate change mitigation, diversity, and other issues, they must communicate outcome metrics such as the number of customer accounts hacked, liters of water consumed per unit of product produced, carbon emissions saved, and percentage of women and people of color promoted internally to management positions. Moving from intention to results is the next evolution that investors are looking for. The only way to outperform in this new era will be for companies to make material ESG issues central to their strategy and operations, to go above and beyond their competitors, and then to measure and communicate their superior performance. Global society faces enormous challenges. But if companies are bold and strategic with their ESG activities, they will be rewarded. George Serafeim is the Charles M.

Stroehle Save Share Marlies Plank Sustainability has gone mainstream in the corporate world. Investors increasingly understand that a corporation’s performance on pertinent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors directly affects long-term profitability—a recognition that is transforming “sustainable investing” into, more simply, “investing.” Most CEOs also now recognize that ESG issues should inform their corporate strategy. But one important constituency remains a stubborn holdout in the sustainability revolution: corporate boards. It is an unfortunate truth that directors tasked with securing their company’s future are often holding the enterprise back with an outdated emphasis on short-term value maximization. A 2019 PwC surveyof more than 700 public-company directors found that 56% thought boards were spending too much time on sustainability. Some of the myopia can be traced to a lack of diversity on boards. Most directors are male, white, and from a similar background, and many are retired executives who came of age professionally at a time when the link between ESG factors and corporate performance was not clearly understood. But a large part of the problem is that until recently, boards didn’t have a mandate to grapple with sustainability; instead, their time was consumed by compliance tasks driven by the corporate secretary and by inside and outside counsel. The concept of “corporate purpose” provides the impetus that boards need to increase their focus on ESG concerns and manage their firms for long-term success. A clear and compelling mission should be at the heart of every company’s efforts to enhance its positive impacts on the environment and society. Without such a purpose, a company cannot have a sustainable corporate strategy, and investors cannot earn sustainable returns. And the ultimate responsibility for defining that purpose must rest with the board, because it has a duty to take an intergenerational perspective that extends beyond the tenure of any management team. Our research on injecting purpose into corporate governance draws on extensive conversations with board chairs, executives, and owners of more than 100 corporations operating across a wide range of industries in more than 20 countries. We’ve undertaken that research as part of the Enacting Purpose Initiative, a multigroup project led by the University of Oxford in conjunction with the University of California, Berkeley; the investment management firm Federated Hermes; the corporate law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and the British Academy. The initiative brings together leaders from academia and practice in the United States and Europe to provide research and guidance on linking corporate purpose to strategy and performance. A major output of this effort is a framework to help boards deliver on purpose. Called SCORE, it was initially devised by Rupert Younger, the director of the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation and the chair of the Enacting Purpose Initiative. SCORE outlines five actions—simplify, connect, own, reward, and exemplify—that can help boards articulate and foster a firm’s durable value proposition and its drivers. Simplify Enacting purpose begins with knowing what it is. For that reason, purpose needs to be simple and clear—straightforward enough to be understood by the entire corporate workforce, the wider supply chain, and other stakeholders. How should purpose be communicated? A good place for boards to start is with a statement of purpose signed and issued by all the directors. The board chair and the governance committee should take the lead in drafting it. The statement should define how the company aims to create value by fulfilling unmet needs in society. It should acknowledge the negative impacts the company must mitigate if it is to retain public support and its license to operate. And it should present a distinctive message—not something so generic that the name of any major competitor could be substituted. If those criteria are met, the statement can be a powerful tool for sharing a company’s vision for long-term value creation, even in industries with negative externalities. EQT, a global private-equity firm, describes its purpose this way: “to future-proof companies and make a positive impact.” EQT defines future-proofing as anticipating what companies need to do to stay relevant amid increasing social and environmental pressures. Its one-page purpose statement, which was first published in its 2019 annual report, explains the firm’s commitment to “being more than capital.” EQT requires that any investment meet clear financial objectives but also contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The company’s founder, Conni Jonsson, told us that writing the statement was fairly easy and that publishing it unites executives, directors, and investors on the company’s priorities. “For us,” he said, “aligning on the statement of purpose was merely manifesting what has been our mindset since inception.” Connect Once corporate purpose has been articulated, it must be connected to strategy and capital allocation decisions. Strategy is about making certain choices and consciously rejecting others after serious deliberation. Capital allocation decisions naturally follow. Sometimes the process might lead a firm to sacrifice short-term profits by abandoning a lucrative but socially harmful product, such as when Dick’s Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault weapons. Other times a company might undertake a project that will certainly lose money, such as when Medtronic publicly shared the design specifications for its ventilators early in the Covid-19 pandemic to speed up manufacturing of the lifesaving devices. Connecting purpose to strategy gives a CEO the necessary foundation to prioritize long-term goals and resist pressure from activist investors and others who care only about short-term returns. “We have made some specific investments that we might not have made without our purpose being so clearly articulated,” Mark Preston, the executive trustee and group CEO of the property behemoth Grosvenor Estate, told us. “More importantly, there are probably some investments that we have not made, as a result of our purpose.” Own Ownership of purpose starts with the board, which must put in place appropriate structures, control systems, and processes for enacting purpose. This goes beyond delegation to the risk, compliance, and ethics committees. Senior management should take responsibility for ensuring that the company’s mission is embraced by everyone in the organization, right down to workers on the shop floor. It does this through its own actions, particularly when making tough trade-off decisions. Effective ownership requires that employees be fully consulted and engaged in delivering on the company’s stated purpose. Although management is responsible for direct communications with staffers, the board can create and oversee internal communication strategies to ensure that the company’s purpose is being effectively diffused throughout the organization. At firms where a controlling family owns large blocks of shares or votes—as is the case in many of the largest companies around the world—the family’s representatives on the board can be especially forceful in helping the company find and execute its purpose. That has certainly been true at Ford Motor Company. “Our drive for environmental sustainability has come from our executive chairman, Bill Ford,” says Henry Ford III, a corporate strategist and the great-great-grandson of the company’s founder. “He was the one who really pushed us to do annual sustainability reports where we are transparent about the progress we are making in terms of reaching our environmental goals.” Reward Primarily through its compensation committee, the board is responsible for establishing the metrics that will be used to determine promotion and remuneration throughout the organization. Purpose, not simply profits, needs to be rewarded. Today compensation is largely based on short-term financial metrics. That has to change: A broader set of financial and nonfinancial metrics should be used to evaluate performance over longer time frames. And the place to start is with the board’s structuring of compensation for senior executives. For example, after British taxpayers bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland during the financial crisis of 2008, the bank’s board of directors linked 25% of executives’ variable pay to key performance indicators in the areas of “customer and stakeholder” and “people and culture.” When choosing the right metrics to tie to rewards, performance should be evaluated in terms of both the company’s ESG activities and the external impact of its products and services. Materiality needs to be a cornerstone—the board and management must be aligned on which ESG issues are relevant to the company’s financial performance and should therefore be baked into executive compensation. For example, carbon emissions are not material for an insurance company, but for a coal-fired utility company they certainly are. Ideally, the measures used to assess performance and drive rewards will eventually be based on a set of independent, rigorous global standards for evaluating ESG impacts, similar to the standards that have long been used to gauge financial performance. The foundation for this has already been laid by the work of the Global Reporting Initiative, the Impact Management Project (IMP), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). (Disclosure: One of us, Eccles, was the founding chairman of SASB and is an unpaid adviser to the IMP.) When this work is complete, standardized ESG reporting will enable peer comparisons of how each company is positioned to handle the risks and opportunities presented by nonfinancial issues. Boards can then more easily link a company’s performance on these metrics to executive compensation. Exemplify Purpose and how it is being achieved must be exemplified in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Quantitatively, a company should integrate its reporting on financial performance with its reporting on sustainability performance, showing how results in the two areas are related. Qualitatively, it is important to have a consistent narrative that includes stories about what the company and its people are doing to fulfill its purpose. Patagonia, the outdoor-clothing retailer, gets this better than most. Its stated purpose—“We’re in business to save our home planet”—drives all its activities. The company not only makes eco-friendly apparel but also engages aggressively in environmental advocacy and promotes an appreciation of sustainable practices and the natural world with beautifully crafted, visually appealing stories on its website and social media. At the U.S. food manufacturer J.M. Smucker, purpose involves “feeding connections that help us thrive.” The firm aims to create “meaningful connections…for those we love and the communities in which we live,” and that’s exemplified in the way it treats its employees. As the executive chairman, Richard Smucker, told us, “You demonstrate your purpose when you take action. Sometimes you’re put in tough ethical situations and it’s about how you respond. For example, when closing plants, we have always given plenty of notice to make time for transition. You get respect because you’ve given respect.” He added, “To communicate our commitment, every year we print a small handbook for all employees with our purpose, our commitment to each other, and our strategy. You can carry in your pocket why we do things, how we do them, and what we do.” A New Duty When we promote the SCORE framework to directors, they often respond with a common fallacy: They cannot elevate corporate purpose because they have a fiduciary duty to put shareholders’ interests above all others. Setting aside the growing evidence that superior performance on material ESG issues leads to superior financial performance, it is simply not true that shareholders must come first. Shareholders are obviously important, but other stakeholders—such as employees, customers, and suppliers—are also crucial to a company’s long-term prospects. To dispel directors’ misconceptions, we recently gathered legal memos on fiduciary duty from all G20 countries and 14 others. None offered an endorsement of shareholder primacy. This was true even in the United States. For example, a memo issued by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz stated: “A corporation ignores environmental and social challenges at its own peril. Corporate boards are obligated to identify and address these risks as part of their essential fiduciary duty to protect the long-term value of the corporation itself.” The key to putting the SCORE framework into practice is finding people and organizations willing to be among the first to act. A natural place to look for them is among the members of Business Roundtable (BRT), the lobbying group that declared in 2019 that the purpose of a corporation is to create value for all stakeholders. Nearly 200 CEOs, including the heads of some of the world’s largest companies, endorsed that idea. Each of those leaders’ boards should now walk the talk by publishing a firm-specific statement of purpose and implementing the SCORE framework. If the directors at the BRT companies fail to act, their behavior will not only breed cynicism but leave them vulnerable to ongoing attack by investors demanding more-concrete action on ESG issues. If investors are to better identify a corporation’s role in society and its prospects for long-term financial returns, board members need to articulate and disclose their company’s durable value proposition and its drivers. The SCORE framework provides a tool to do that. We hope more boards will use it to promote long-term value creation and a more just and sustainable economy. Robert G.

The Challenge of Rating ESG Performance Simon MacMahon Save Share Marlies Plank When I began working at Sustainalytics in 2008, after completing an MBA in finance and sustainability, the business of rating companies on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance was very much a niche field. Our company had only 20 people in a single office in Toronto, where we produced reports on 300 companies, most of them Canadian firms traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Today we have 650 people based in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia providing ESG research, ratings, and data on tens of thousands of companies. And we’re not alone: A handful of other big rating firms, along with dozens more smaller organizations, distribute some sustainability data. What has changed even more than the size of our team and the volume of research we produce is the way ratings like ours are used. We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the use of ESG information in the investment process. A decade ago this information was of interest to a relatively small segment of the investment community. Today nearly all large institutional investors utilize ESG research to some degree. That’s because recognition is growing that this data has real value and can drive better investment outcomes—not in every case, but in enough cases to make a material difference to investors. Furthermore, while ESG factors can affect a company’s bottom line directly, they also affect a company’s reputation, and business leaders and investors are recognizing the potential costs of not managing firms’ ESG risks. Creating the ratings is challenging work. There are no uniform requirements for reporting ESG information, and many environmental and social impacts are hard to measure. So the data inputs that we start with are fundamentally less structured, less complete, and of lower quality than financial data, which companies are required to present in standardized form and have audited by accountants. The lack of rules and robust metrics makes our job more difficult—but also more valuable. Because we’re compiling data and generating insights that many investors have not used in the past and don’t have easy access to, very often this information is not priced into stocks. It is important to us that the companies we assess understand how we arrive at our ratings. We consider two elements: what risks the businesses are exposed to and how well they’re managing them. We classify each company into one of 138 industries, and we have a list of relevant risks for each. For instance, a mining enterprise will typically face risks related to carbon and noncarbon emissions, environmental management systems, water use, occupational health and safety, and corporate governance, among other matters. To ascertain its risk exposure, we look at the specifics of its business. Suppose the company operates in jurisdictions where complicity in bribery and corruption is common or where managing community and labor relations is especially challenging. It faces more risks than do competitors that avoid such jurisdictions, so we’d adjust its risk exposure upward. A big part of our work is calibrating the degree of ESG risk that firms face. The next step in rating a company is to assess how well it is managing its risk exposure. This involves looking at the types of programs, policies, and management practices the company uses and its preparedness to avoid or mitigate certain risks. If we don’t have evidence that the company is adequately prepared, it gets a lower score. Firms that do have appropriate risk-handling measures in place should disclose what they are doing, to ensure that those measures are taken into account. Levels of disclosure have increased tremendously in recent years, but they’re still not as high as we’d like them to be. The way companies engage with us throughout the rating process varies quite a bit. A decade ago only 10% of firms responded to our requests and talked with us about our analysis. Today more than 60% of large companies share information with us, and that number has been growing each year. In general, businesses that take special pride in their reputation and those that have an ESG-minded investor base are willing to spend more time communicating with us. In other cases, companies that fare poorly in our ratings or are facing criticism of their sustainability or governance practices are encouraged by their investors to interact with us. Sometimes business leaders complain about “survey fatigue” and say they are hearing from too many ratings firms that request too much information. I empathize with that. Various international organizations are working to standardize ESG reporting, which will make it less onerous for company managers. Regardless, I believe it’s worth their time to engage more deeply with the firms that, like ours, have the biggest presence in the market. Once we have completed our ratings process, we send the profile to the company for feedback. During those conversations, we’re looking for any additional information or clarification that can enhance our analysis. New information doesn’t always lead to a change in our rating, but we do listen. As ESG rating outcomes become more important, we certainly hear from people inside firms who forcefully argue for their point of view. Today nearly all large institutional investors use ESG research to some degree. Companies often see their ratings move if they begin addressing sustainability issues in new ways or if a significant ESG controversy arises, which can indicate a management gap. However, some of the more dramatic improvements result from changes to risk exposure when companies embark on a strategic shift in their operations or business model. For instance, the Danish power company Ørsted (formerly known as Danske Olie og Naturgas) used to be involved in oil and gas exploration and production. In 2017, however, it sold its oil and gas assets and invested heavily in renewables; it’s now one of the world’s largest players in the offshore wind sector. The company still has some coal-fired power plants, but it has announced aggressive plans to phase them out. From 2018 to 2019 its risk rating score improved markedly. Companies’ ESG risk exposure can also move in a negative direction. For example, Facebook’s ESG ratings have fallen because of increased public alarm about the company’s handling of data privacy and security. Similarly, Amazon has seen its ESG scores decline in the wake of growing antitrust scrutiny and concern over workplace conditions for its employees. Peugeot, the French carmaker, has experienced a decline in its ESG ratings since its 2017 acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, which make less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result of the acquisition, Peugeot will most likely miss the European Union’s 2021 target for CO2 emissions, potentially exposing it to fines of several hundred million euros. For companies that want to put their best foot forward, good disclosure of their most material ESG challenges—and how they’re addressing them—goes far. The best way to improve disclosure is to issue a sustainability report that has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards. When companies invest the time to produce a thorough report, our analysis is easier and the amount of time it takes to talk with us and the other ESG ratings firms goes down quite a bit. But the most important part of the process happens when companies scrutinize their business and their business model to understand which issues are most material in terms of ESG risk. Reducing their risk exposure or finding a better way to manage the risk typically results in the greatest benefits for the company and its investors, as well as for the environment and society. The amount of analytical rigor that goes into ESG ratings has increased substantially, and that’s a good thing. These ratings are more relevant and more high-profile than ever before, and investors are paying closer attention. A poor rating draws more scrutiny to a company, and a strong rating can increase investment flows. That’s part of what makes this work so interesting.

Global strategy Name Your Brand with a Global Audience in Mind by Nataly Kelly September 10, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary As you look to expand your business into international markets, what can you do to ensure you select a brand name that resonates with your global customers? Here are five strategies to help marketers develop a global-ready brand name. First, consider the brand’s expected shelf life to determine how big an investment you want to make in the name. Next, gather input from international customers to shed light on any language- or culture-specific connotations. Third, conduct online research to determine the SEO landscape for your top names. Fourth, ensure your legal bases are covered. Finally, circle back to your customers — an iterative approach is the only way to ensure that the name you settle on is your best possible option. Epoxydude/Getty Images Leer en español Coming up with the perfect name for a brand takes a lot of work. Whether you’re launching a new product or rebranding an existing one, marketers often spend months analyzing data, conducting interviews, and carrying out research to find the best name to set themselves apart from competitors. But no matter how thorough you may be, if your research is biased toward your home market, you’re likely to run into challenges when you expand internationally. What can marketers do to set a brand up for global success from the start? 1. Consider the brand’s global shelf life. The longer you expect the brand name to stay in global circulation, the more careful you’ll need to be with selecting a name that takes international considerations into account. Are international customers contributing a significant percentage of revenue today? Do you expect that percentage to increase in the future? If so, you’ll definitely want to consider other markets in your decision-making process. If selling abroad is not a top priority, then there is less urgency today. But even if it’s not an immediate concern, thinking about these questions now can help you avoid extra rebranding work later. Otherwise, you run the risk of learning too late that the name you picked isn’t appropriate for your future markets if and when you do choose to expand internationally. 2. Gather input from international customers. You’ll want to start by coming up with a list of candidate names for your brand or product. It’s fine to do this exercise with your home market and language in mind, but if you can, try to involve people with international experience from the very beginning. Their input upfront can help steer you toward more globally viable options. Once you have a few candidates, it’s time to do some qualitative research: Interviews with customers from your prospective international markets can shed light on how the different options sound in different cultural and linguistic contexts. If you’re not sure which markets to include, start with the countries where you have the most customers today. If you don’t yet have any customers outside your home country, you can research the top global markets for your industry. And if that fails, try looking at the top countries in which your competitors or industry-adjacent companies operate. In addition, if you don’t have existing international customers to interview, the next best thing is to ask prospective customers — people who fit the general description of a potential customer. And if that’s not possible, consider reaching out to business partners who operate in your target markets for their insights and/or connections. Here are some research questions you can ask: Is the name easy to pronounce in other languages? The easier it is to say, the better. Keep in mind that the pronunciation in other languages often adds new meaning, so you’ll need input from experts in the local market. For example, the brand name for Tide detergent in Chinese is Taizi, which both sounds similar to “Tide” and literally means “gets rid of dirt.” Reebok is known in Chinese as Rui bu, which means “quick steps.” Marketers often worry about consistency across languages, but brand names don’t necessarily need to sound identical in every tongue. Heineken in Chinese is Xi li, which sounds nothing like the English name, but translates to “happy power.” What connotations does the name have in your target cultures? By simply surveying or interviewing people in your company’s top countries, you can find out quickly if your name candidate has any awkward or embarrassing connotations. You can also find out if certain brand names have positive connotations you might not have been aware of, or if they sound similar to any other widely known brands. In addition, even in markets that share your company’s native language, it’s important to think about cultural segments within your target audience. Both Nike and Ben and Jerry’s launched products with “black and tan” in the name, not realizing that this term was highly offensive to customers in Ireland. Both ended up pulling the products from shelves as a result. What other names would you suggest? This is my favorite part of the process. Often, if you just explain your product’s purpose and share a few key ideas that you want associated with it, your target customers will provide you with some great alternatives for what they might call it. These options might even work well not just for your international customers, but for your domestic market as well, since the authentic voice of the customer might resonate better with your target market than something concocted by your marketing team in a vacuum. 3. Understand the SEO landscape. Once you have a good understanding of your top name candidates, it’s time to consider the SEO implications in each of your target countries and languages. Try to find a brand name that is unique enough that your company can quickly become a top search result for that term. For example, SEO expert and tech founder Rand Fishkin chose SparkToro as his company’s name because he knew it would provide an SEO advantage in his target market. Be sure to conduct this search viability exercise in each of your top potential markets, since SEO can vary dramatically in different areas. As part of this research, you’ll want to identify the branded web assets you’ll need to support the brand. Are the domain names, social media accounts, and other online channels you’d like to obtain actually available? Think through your current marketing strategies and your future plans. If SEO is a major component of your strategy, don’t pick a brand name that will lead people in your top markets to land on other websites or social channels when they search for it. 4. Get legal input. Now that you have gathered customer input and conducted online research, hopefully a couple of potential names have risen to the top. Once you’re confident in the global viability and online marketing potential of these names, ask your legal team for advice on the trademark and intellectual property front. Often, legal teams don’t want to be involved until you’ve settled on your final name, because international trademark research can consume significant time and resources — but it’s vital to ensure your legal bases are covered. Ask your team if they’d prefer to have the full list of candidates earlier, only get involved when you’ve compiled a short list, or wait until you’ve made your final selection. 5. Circle back to your customers. Ultimately, coming up with a name that’s suited for international scale is an iterative process. You’ll think you’ve landed on a great name, until you find out it has unpleasant connotations in one of your top markets. Then, you’ll find another winner, but you’ll realize you can’t obtain certain key web properties or social media handles that you’ll need. You might find you have to start back at square one and come up with an entirely new list of candidates. But rest assured that this is time well spent. Even though it might be tempting to just choose a name quickly that will work in your home market and language, remember that small decisions today can dramatically impact your international growth later on. Designing anything for global scale — a process, a product, or a brand name — always takes a bit more upfront thought. But if you invest this time now, it will future-proof your marketing content, domains, publicity, and many other investments that you’ll make in your brand along the way.

Collaboration Remote Work Doesn’t Have to Mean All-Day Video Calls by Marco Minervini , Darren Murph and Phanish Puranam September 09, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary When people work from home they are often expected to be virtually present during the regular workday. This can pose problems as people juggle the realities of working from home. GitLab, which has long worked all remotely, has shown that working from home can be highly flexible, mixing asynchronous and synchronous work as appropriate according to the importance of tacit communication at the task level. GitLab’s process is enabled by respecting: (1) clear boundaries at the task level between doing tasks and declaring them done; (2) the minimum viable change principe; and (3) the need for open communication. In addition, GitLab offers opportunities for socializing online, which proved helpful during the pandemic. Edwin Remsberg/Getty Images Leer en español The Covid-19 crisis has distanced people from the workplace, and employers have generally, if sometimes reluctantly, accepted that people can work effectively from home. As if to compensate for this distancing and keep the workplace alive in a virtual sense, employers have also encouraged people to stick closely to the conventional workday. The message is that working from home is fine and can even be very efficient — as long as people join video calls along with everyone else all through the day. But employees often struggle with the “workday” when working from home, because many have to deal with the competing requests coming from their family, also housebound. So how effective really is working from home if everyone is still working to the clock? Is it possible to ditch the clock? The answer seems to be that it is. Since before the pandemic we’ve been studying the remote work practices of the tech company GitLab to explore what it might look like if companies to break their employees’ chronological chains as well as their ties to the physical workplace. The challenge for GitLab From its foundation in 2014, GitLab has maintained an all-remote staff that now comprises more than 1,300 employees spread across over 65 countries. The “git” way of working uses tools that let employees work on ongoing projects wherever they are in the world and at their preferred time. The idea is that because it’s always “9 to 5” somewhere on the planet, work can continue around the clock, increasing aggregate productivity. That sounds good, but a workforce staggered in both time and space presents unique coordination challenges with wide-ranging organizational implications. The most natural way to distribute work across locations is to make it modular and independent, so that there is little need for direct coordination — workers can be effectively without knowing how their colleagues are progressing. This is why distributed work can be so effective for call centers and in patents evaluation. But this approach has its limits in development and innovation related activities, where the interdependencies between components of work are not always easy to see ahead of time. For this kind of complex work, co-location with ongoing communication is often a better approach because it offers two virtues: synchronicity and media richness. The time lag in the interaction between two or more individuals is almost zero when they are co-located, and, although the content of the conversation may be the same in both face-to-face and in virtual environments, the technology may not be fully able to convey soft social and background contextual cues — how easy is it to sense other people’s reactions in a group zoom meeting? All this implies that simply attempting to replicate online (through video or voice chat) what happened naturally in co-located settings is unlikely to be a winning or complete strategy. Yet this approach of “seeing the face” is the one that people seem to default to when forced to work remotely, as our survey of remote working practices in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns around the world has revealed. Tacit coordination There is a way through this dilemma. Our earlier research on offshoring of software development showed that drawing on tacit coordination mechanisms, such as a shared understanding of work norms and context, allows for coordination without direct communication. Coordination in this case happens through the observation of the action of other employees and being able to predict what they will do and need based on shared norms. It can occur either synchronously (where, for instance, two people might work on the same Google doc during the same time period), or asynchronously (when people make clear hand-offs of the document, and do not work on it when the other is). Software development organizations often opt for this solution and tend to rely extensively on shared repositories and document authoring tools, with systems for coordinating contributions (e.g., continuous integration and version control tools). But GitLab is quite unique in the for-profit sector in how extensively it relies on this third path not only for its coding but for how the organization itself functions. It leans particularly on asynchronous working because its employees are distributed across multiple time zones. As a result, although the company does use videoconferencing, almost no employee ever faces a day full of video meetings. How it works at GitLab At the heart of the engineering work that drives GitLab’s product development is the “git” workflow process invented by Linux founder Linus Torvalds. In this process, a programmer making a contribution to a code “forks” (copies) the code, so that it is not blocked to other users, works on it, and then makes a “merge request” to have the edited version replace the original, and this new version becomes available for other contributions. The process combines the possibility of distributed asynchronous work with a structure that checks for potential coordination failures and ensures clarity on decision rights. Completely electronic (which makes remote work feasible) and fully documented, it has become an important framework for distributed software development in both for-profit and open source contexts. GitLab has taken the git a step further, applying it also to managerial work that involves ambiguity and uncertainty. For instance, GitLab’s chief marketer recently outlined a vision for integrating video into the company’s year-ahead strategy. He requested asynchronous feedback from across the company within a fixed time window, and then scheduled a single synchronous meeting to agree on a final version of the vision. This vision triggered asynchronously input changes from multiple contributors to the company’s handbook pages relating to marketing objectives and key results that were merged on completion. GitLab’s high degree of reliance on asynchronous working is made possible by respecting the following three rules right down to the task level: 1. Separate responsibility for doing the task from the responsibility for declaring it done. In co-located settings, where employees are in the same office, easy communication and social cues allow them to efficiently resolve ambiguities and manage conflict around work responsibilities and remits. In remote settings, however, this can be difficult. In GitLab, therefore, every task is expected to have a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI), who is responsible for the completion of the task and has freedom in how it should be performed. The DRI, however, does not get to decide whether the task has been completed. That function is the responsibility of a “Maintainer,” who has the authority to accept or reject the DRI’s merge requests. Clarity on these roles for every task helps reduce confusions and delays and enables multiple DRIs to work in parallel in any way they want on different parts of a code by making local copies (“forking”). It is the Maintainer’s role to avoid unnecessary changes and maintain consistency in the working version of the document or code. In a non-software context, say in developing the GitLab handbook page on expenses policies, individual DRIs, who could be anyone in the company, would write specific policies in any way they choose, and their contributions would be accepted or rejected by the CFO acting in the capacity of Maintainer, who could also offer feedback (but not direction) to the DRIs. Once live, the merged page serves as the single source of truth on expenses policies unless or until someone else makes a new proposal. Once more, the Maintainer would approve, reject, or offer feedback on the new proposal. In contexts like this, we would expect people in traditional management positions to serve as Maintainers. 2. Respect the “minimum viable change” principle. When coordination is asynchronous, there is a risk that coordination failures may go undetected for too long – for instance, two individuals may be working in parallel on the same problem, making one of their efforts redundant, or one person may be making changes that that are incompatible with the efforts of another. To minimize this risk, employees are urged to submit the minimum viable change — an early stage, imperfect version of their suggested changes to code or documents. This makes it more likely that people will pick up on whether work is incompatible or being duplicated. Obviously, a policy of minimum viable changes should come with a “no shame” policy on delivering a temporarily imperfect output. In remote settings, the value of knowing what the other is doing as soon as possible is greater than getting the perfect product. 3. Always communicate publicly. As GitLab team members are prone to say, “we do not send internal email here.” Instead, employees post all questions and share all information on the Slack channels of their teams, and later the team leaders decide what information needs to be permanently visible to others. If so, it gets stored in a place available to everyone in the company, in an “issue” document or on a page in the company’s online handbook, which is accessible to anyone, in or outside the company. This rule means that people don’t run the risk of duplicating, or even inadvertently destroying the work of their colleagues. Managers devote a lot of time to curating the information generated through the work of employees they supervise and are expected to know better than others what information may be either broadly needed by a future team or that would be useful for people outside the company. Recognizing the limits of the GitLab approach However well implemented, asynchronous remote working of this kind cannot supply much in the way of social interaction. That’s a major failing, because social interaction is not only a source of pleasure and motivation for most, it is also where the “random encounters,” the serendipitous exchanges by the coffee machines and lift lobbies, create opportunities for ideas and information to flow and recombine. To minimize this limitation, GitLab provides occasions for non-task related interaction. Each day, team members may attend one of three optional social calls — staggered to be inclusive of time zones. The calls consist of groups of 8-10 people in a video chatroom, where they are free to discuss whatever they want (GitLab provides a daily starting question as icebreaker in case needed, such as: “What did you do over the weekend?” or “Where is the coolest place you ever traveled and why?”). In addition, GitLab has social slack groups: thematic chat rooms that employees with similar interests can participate in (such as: #cat, #dogs, #cooking, #mental_health_aware, #daily_gratitude, #gaming) and a #donut_be_strangers channel that allows strangers that have a mutual interest to have a coffee chat to get together. Of course, GitLab managers are under no illusion that these groups substitute perfectly for the kinds of rich social interactions outside work that people find rewarding. But they do help to keep employees connected, and, at a time when many employees have been working under confinement rules, this has proved very helpful in sustaining morale. *** Working from home in an effective way goes beyond just giving employees a laptop and a Zoom account. It encompasses practices intended to compensate or avoid the core limitations of working remotely, as well as fully leverage the flexibility that remote can offer — working not only from anywhere but at any desired time. We have focused on GitLab because it not only has extensive experience in remote working but also because it pursues an unusual mode of solving the intrinsic challenges of remote work. While some of GitLab’s core processes (like its long, remote onboarding process for new hires) and advantages (like the possibility of hiring across the world) cannot be fully reproduced in the short run in companies that will be just temporarily remote, there are others that any company can easily implement.

Gender Don’t Let the Pandemic Set Back Gender Equality by Deepa Mahajan , Olivia White , Anu Madgavkar and Mekala Krishnan September 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary A new McKinsey analysis shows that women’s jobs are 1.8 times more vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic than men’s jobs: Women make up 39% of global employment but account for 54% of overall job losses as of May 2020. At the same time, they bear the burden of unpaid health and child care. This setback follows a five-year period in which tangible progress toward equality in work and society stagnated. Policy makers and business leaders need to act fast to push for greater gender equality, and CEOs can start with three immediate actions. First, they can track the data: Are job losses or requests for leave higher among women? Have promotion rates of women slowed? Second, they can take action. Companies that are rehiring should ensure that hiring practices consider gender diversity. Those investing in reskilling need to ensure female workers are actively encouraged to participate in such programs. And third, they can look for opportunities to increase gender equity throughout their ecosystem. Are your products and services designed to counter these regressive effects?

Progress towards greater gender equality has been hesitant and halting over the past five years and the Covid-19 pandemic now risks sending it into reverse. Our analysis shows that women’s jobs are 1.8 times more vulnerable to this crisis than men’s jobs: Women make up 39% of global employment but account for 54% of overall job losses as of May 2020. At the same time, the burden of unpaid care, which has risen in the pandemic, falls disproportionately on women. This backwards move is not just a blow to women and societal progress but also to the economy and business. If no action is taken to counter the regressive effects, we estimate that global GDP growth could be $1 trillion lower in 2030 than it would be if women’s unemployment simply tracked that of men in each sector. Conversely, taking action now to advance gender equality could add $13 trillion to global GDP in 2030, compared with no action. A middle path — taking action only after the crisis has subsided — would boost the economy but reduce the potential opportunity by more than $5 trillion. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Beyond the economic impact, business leaders have a strong interest in furthering gender equality during this crisis. McKinsey research has found that gender diversity is a key to financial success: Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. Moreover, companies now pulling back on diversity and inclusion may be placing themselves at a disadvantage by limiting their access to talent, diverse skills, leadership styles, and perspectives. Reversing the regressive trend will require, among things, investment in education, family planning, maternal mortality prevention, digital inclusion, and unpaid care work. We estimate that incremental public, private, or household annual spending on these five areas would need to rise 20 to 30% in 2025 above the “business as usual” levels, or a total of $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion. By comparison, the economic benefits of narrowing gender gaps are six to eight times higher than the social spending required, we estimate. As we discuss below, investment is just the start. The Covid Setback Follows a Period of Scant Progress. Our estimates of the economics of gender parity date back to the McKinsey Global Institute’s (MGI’s) Power of Parity work in 2015, which analyzed 15 gender-equality indicators across four categories: equality in work, essential services and enablers of economic opportunity, legal protection and political voice, and physical security and autonomy. Using these indicators, MGI established a strong link between gender equality in society and gender equality in work — and has shown that the latter is not achievable without the former. Despite growing awareness of and support for greater gender equality, tangible progress toward equality in work and society stagnated in the five years between 2014 and 2019. Some indicators did improve, such as maternal mortality, the share of women in professional and technical jobs, and political representation. Overall, however, gender equality in work continued to lag behind gender equality in society. The level of female participation in the labor force has not budged — it sits at about two-thirds that of men — although there are regional and country variations. Now, with Covid-19, women have borne the brunt of the economic impact. Women’s employment is dropping faster than average, even accounting for the fact that women and men work in different sectors. The nature of work remains significantly gender specific, with women and men tending to cluster in different occupations. This shapes the gender implications of the pandemic: Our analysis shows that globally female jobs are 19% more at risk than male ones simply because women are disproportionately represented in sectors negatively affected by the Covid-19 crisis, such as accommodation and food service. Yet the gendered nature of work across industries only explains one-fourth of the difference between job-loss rates for men and women. In the United States, for example, women made up 46% of workers before Covid-19. Factoring in industry-mix effects suggests that women would make up 43% of job losses. However, unemployment data indicate that women make up 54% of the overall job losses to date. In India, women made up 20% of the workforce before Covid-19, and their share of job losses resulting from the industry mix alone is estimated at 17% — they actually account for 23% of overall job losses. What factors explain the other three-quarters? An important one is the burden of unpaid care, the demands of which have grown substantially during the pandemic. Women do an average of 75% of the world’s total unpaid-care work, including child care, caring for the elderly, cooking, and cleaning. As Covid-19 has disproportionately increased the time women spend on family responsibilities, women have dropped out of the workforce at a higher rate than explained by labor-market dynamics alone. Another factor could be Covid-19’s disproportionate impact on female entrepreneurship, including women-owned microenterprises in emerging economies, where such enterprises account for a high share of female labor-force participation. The crisis may have made some family resources scarce, including investment capital or digital devices that families must now share as children’s schooling has gone online. Attitudes also shape how women experience the economic consequences of a crisis relative to men: Traditional mindsets may be reflected in current decisions, at the organizational level or even within the family, about who gets to keep their jobs. For example, according to the global World Values Survey, more than half the respondents in many countries in South Asia and MENA agreed that men have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce. About one in six respondents in developed countries said the same. Three Areas for Action The strong message emerging from our research is that policy makers and business leaders need to act fast to push for greater gender equality. Overarching areas for action include reducing the gender imbalance in child care responsibility, for example through better recognition of unpaid work and rebalancing between men and women; closing the gender gap in digital inclusion, which is especially important as remote work and online shopping have become more prominent during the pandemic; and tackling attitudinal biases, potentially through campaigns and enlisting male champions to help drive home the idea that a larger number of women at work represents socially and economically beneficial progress. We recommend CEOs start with these three actions: 1. Track the data. Business leaders will need transparency on gendered regressive impacts within their company. Are job losses or requests for leave higher among women? Have promotion rates of women slowed? With new hiring, is the pre-Covid gender balance level being maintained, or is there slippage? Such information for the company as a whole can be accompanied by more detailed data by department and tenure band. 2. Take action. Many companies have already put in place policies to enable flexible working, but as lockdowns extend in many parts of the world, they will need to more actively consider how to factor the pandemic’s impact into performance reviews, prevent employee burnout, and ensure that traditional diversity practices, such as sponsorship programs or employee resource groups, are reinvented for a virtual world. Companies that are rehiring need to ensure that hiring practices consider gender diversity. Those investing in reskilling need to ensure female workers are actively encouraged to participate in such programs. In this Covid-19 period, leading by example can help, including encouraging employees to share the unpaid care burden openly and willingly, setting boundaries for those working remotely between office life and home life, and ensuring that your company shows care for the health and mental well-being of women employees. 3. Look for opportunities to increase gender equity throughout your corporate ecosystem. How can your products and services help counter regressive effects? Deliberately identifying such impacts and potential interventions can make a difference. For example, financial services firms can ensure their products reach women entrepreneurs, and technology firms can ensure their products are designed with diverse perspectives in mind. Companies can also take action to encourage gender diversity not just within their organizations but also more broadly across their supply chains and distribution channels. The evidence from our research is clear: Greater gender equality is good for the economy and society as a whole. If we act now to remove barriers to greater female labor-force participation and a bigger role in society, we can reap the economic and social benefits. If we delay, the benefits will be more meager, while allowing the disappointing status quo to continue will result in a backwards slide. Parity is powerful. It needs to move forward.

Innovation How Amazon Automated Work and Put Its People to Better Use by Alex Kantrowitz September 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Replacing people with AI may seem tempting, but it’s also likely a mistake. Amazon’s “hands off the wheel” initiative might be a model for how companies can adopt AI to automate repetitive jobs, but keep employees on the payroll by transferring them to more creative roles where they can add more value to the company. Amazon’s choice to eliminate jobs but retain the workers and move them into new roles allowed the company to be more nimble and find new ways to stay ahead of competitors. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Leer en español At an automation conference in late 2018, a high-ranking banking official looked up from his buffet plate and stated his objective without hesitation: I’m here, he told me, to eliminate full-time employees. I was at the conference because after spending months researching how Amazon automates work at its headquarters, I was eager to learn how other firms thought about this powerful technology. After one short interaction, it was clear that some have it completely wrong. For the past decade, Amazon has been pushing to automate office work under a program now known as Hands off the Wheel. The purpose was not to eliminate jobs but to automate tasks so that the company could reassign people to build new products — to do more with the people on staff, rather than doing the same with fewer people. The strategy appears to have paid off: At a time when it’s possible to start new businesses faster and cheaper than ever before, Hands off the Wheel has kept Amazon operating nimbly, propelled it ahead of its competitors, and shown that automating in order to fire can mean missing big opportunities. As companies look at how to integrate increasingly powerful AI capabilities into their businesses, they’d do well to consider this example. The animating idea behind Hands off the Wheel originated at Amazon’s South Lake Union office towers, where the company began automating work in the mid-2010s under an initiative some called Project Yoda. At the time, employees in Amazon’s retail management division spent their days making deals and working out product promotions as well as determining what items to stock in its warehouses, in what quantities, and for what price. But with two decades’ worth of retail data at its disposal, Amazon’s leadership decided to use “the force” (machine learning) to handle the formulaic processes involved in keeping warehouses stocked. “When you have actions that can be predicted over and over again, you don’t need people doing them,” Neil Ackerman, an ex-Amazon general manager, told me. The project began in 2012, when Amazon hired Ralf Herbrich as its director of machine learning and made the automation effort one of his launch projects. Getting the software to be good at inventory management and pricing predictions took years, Herbrich told me, because his team had to account for low-volume product orders that befuddled its data-hungry machine-learning algorithms. By 2015, the team’s machine-learning predictions were good enough that Amazon’s leadership placed them in employees’ software tools, turning them into a kind of copilot for human workers. But at that point the humans could override the suggestions, and many did, setting back progress. Eventually, though, automation took hold. “It took a few years to slowly roll it out, because there was training to be done,” Herbrich said. If the system couldn’t make its own decisions, he explained, it couldn’t learn. Leadership required employees to automate a large number of tasks, though that varied across divisions. “In 2016, my goals for Hands off the Wheel were 80% of all my activity,” one ex-employee told me.” By 2018 Hands off the Wheel was part of business as usual. Having delivered on his project, Herbrich left the company in 2020. The transition to Hands off the Wheel wasn’t easy. The retail division employees were despondent at first, recognizing that their jobs were transforming. “It was a total change,” the former employee mentioned above said. “Something that you were incentivized to do, now you’re being disincentivized to do.” Yet in time, many saw the logic. “When we heard that ordering was going to be automated by algorithms, on the one hand, it’s like, ‘OK, what’s happening to my job?’” another former employee, Elaine Kwon, told me. “On the other hand, you’re also not surprised. You’re like, ‘OK, as a business this makes sense.’” Although some companies might have seen an opportunity to reduce head count, Amazon assigned the employees new work. The company’s retail division workers largely moved into product and program manager jobs — fast-growing roles within Amazon that typically belong to professional inventors. Product managers oversee new product development, while program managers oversee groups of projects. “People who were doing these mundane repeated tasks are now being freed up to do tasks that are about invention,” Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s departing CEO of Worldwide Consumer, told me. “The things that are harder for machines to do.” Had Amazon eliminated those jobs, it would have made its flagship business more profitable but most likely would have caused itself to miss its next new businesses. Instead of automating to milk a single asset, it set out to build new ones. Consider Amazon Go, the company’s checkout-free convenience store. Go was founded, in part, by Dilip Kumar, an executive once in charge of the company’s pricing and promotions operations. While Kumar spent two years acting as a technical adviser to CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s machine learning engineers began automating work in his old division, so he took a new lead role in a project aimed at eliminating the most annoying part of shopping in real life: checking out. Kumar helped dream up Go, which is now a pillar of Amazon’s broader strategy. If Amazon is any indication, businesses that reassign employees after automating their work will thrive. Those that don’t risk falling behind. In shaky economic times, the need for cost-cutting could make it tempting to replace people with machines, but I’ll offer a word of warning: Think twice before doing that. It’s a message I wish I had shared with the banker. Alex Kantrowitz is the author of Always Day One, a new book about the tech giants’ work culture.

Global strategy Name Your Brand with a Global Audience in Mind by Nataly Kelly September 10, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary As you look to expand your business into international markets, what can you do to ensure you select a brand name that resonates with your global customers? Here are five strategies to help marketers develop a global-ready brand name. First, consider the brand’s expected shelf life to determine how big an investment you want to make in the name. Next, gather input from international customers to shed light on any language- or culture-specific connotations. Third, conduct online research to determine the SEO landscape for your top names. Fourth, ensure your legal bases are covered. Finally, circle back to your customers — an iterative approach is the only way to ensure that the name you settle on is your best possible option. Epoxydude/Getty Images Leer en español Coming up with the perfect name for a brand takes a lot of work. Whether you’re launching a new product or rebranding an existing one, marketers often spend months analyzing data, conducting interviews, and carrying out research to find the best name to set themselves apart from competitors. But no matter how thorough you may be, if your research is biased toward your home market, you’re likely to run into challenges when you expand internationally. What can marketers do to set a brand up for global success from the start? 1. Consider the brand’s global shelf life. The longer you expect the brand name to stay in global circulation, the more careful you’ll need to be with selecting a name that takes international considerations into account. Are international customers contributing a significant percentage of revenue today? Do you expect that percentage to increase in the future? If so, you’ll definitely want to consider other markets in your decision-making process. If selling abroad is not a top priority, then there is less urgency today. But even if it’s not an immediate concern, thinking about these questions now can help you avoid extra rebranding work later. Otherwise, you run the risk of learning too late that the name you picked isn’t appropriate for your future markets if and when you do choose to expand internationally. 2. Gather input from international customers. You’ll want to start by coming up with a list of candidate names for your brand or product. It’s fine to do this exercise with your home market and language in mind, but if you can, try to involve people with international experience from the very beginning. Their input upfront can help steer you toward more globally viable options. Once you have a few candidates, it’s time to do some qualitative research: Interviews with customers from your prospective international markets can shed light on how the different options sound in different cultural and linguistic contexts. If you’re not sure which markets to include, start with the countries where you have the most customers today. If you don’t yet have any customers outside your home country, you can research the top global markets for your industry. And if that fails, try looking at the top countries in which your competitors or industry-adjacent companies operate. In addition, if you don’t have existing international customers to interview, the next best thing is to ask prospective customers — people who fit the general description of a potential customer. And if that’s not possible, consider reaching out to business partners who operate in your target markets for their insights and/or connections. Here are some research questions you can ask: Is the name easy to pronounce in other languages? The easier it is to say, the better. Keep in mind that the pronunciation in other languages often adds new meaning, so you’ll need input from experts in the local market. For example, the brand name for Tide detergent in Chinese is Taizi, which both sounds similar to “Tide” and literally means “gets rid of dirt.” Reebok is known in Chinese as Rui bu, which means “quick steps.” Marketers often worry about consistency across languages, but brand names don’t necessarily need to sound identical in every tongue. Heineken in Chinese is Xi li, which sounds nothing like the English name, but translates to “happy power.” What connotations does the name have in your target cultures? By simply surveying or interviewing people in your company’s top countries, you can find out quickly if your name candidate has any awkward or embarrassing connotations. You can also find out if certain brand names have positive connotations you might not have been aware of, or if they sound similar to any other widely known brands. In addition, even in markets that share your company’s native language, it’s important to think about cultural segments within your target audience. Both Nike and Ben and Jerry’s launched products with “black and tan” in the name, not realizing that this term was highly offensive to customers in Ireland. Both ended up pulling the products from shelves as a result. What other names would you suggest? This is my favorite part of the process. Often, if you just explain your product’s purpose and share a few key ideas that you want associated with it, your target customers will provide you with some great alternatives for what they might call it. These options might even work well not just for your international customers, but for your domestic market as well, since the authentic voice of the customer might resonate better with your target market than something concocted by your marketing team in a vacuum. 3. Understand the SEO landscape. Once you have a good understanding of your top name candidates, it’s time to consider the SEO implications in each of your target countries and languages. Try to find a brand name that is unique enough that your company can quickly become a top search result for that term. For example, SEO expert and tech founder Rand Fishkin chose SparkToro as his company’s name because he knew it would provide an SEO advantage in his target market. Be sure to conduct this search viability exercise in each of your top potential markets, since SEO can vary dramatically in different areas. As part of this research, you’ll want to identify the branded web assets you’ll need to support the brand. Are the domain names, social media accounts, and other online channels you’d like to obtain actually available? Think through your current marketing strategies and your future plans. If SEO is a major component of your strategy, don’t pick a brand name that will lead people in your top markets to land on other websites or social channels when they search for it. 4. Get legal input. Now that you have gathered customer input and conducted online research, hopefully a couple of potential names have risen to the top. Once you’re confident in the global viability and online marketing potential of these names, ask your legal team for advice on the trademark and intellectual property front. Often, legal teams don’t want to be involved until you’ve settled on your final name, because international trademark research can consume significant time and resources — but it’s vital to ensure your legal bases are covered. Ask your team if they’d prefer to have the full list of candidates earlier, only get involved when you’ve compiled a short list, or wait until you’ve made your final selection. 5. Circle back to your customers. Ultimately, coming up with a name that’s suited for international scale is an iterative process. You’ll think you’ve landed on a great name, until you find out it has unpleasant connotations in one of your top markets. Then, you’ll find another winner, but you’ll realize you can’t obtain certain key web properties or social media handles that you’ll need. You might find you have to start back at square one and come up with an entirely new list of candidates. But rest assured that this is time well spent. Even though it might be tempting to just choose a name quickly that will work in your home market and language, remember that small decisions today can dramatically impact your international growth later on. Designing anything for global scale — a process, a product, or a brand name — always takes a bit more upfront thought. But if you invest this time now, it will future-proof your marketing content, domains, publicity, and many other investments that you’ll make in your brand along the way.

Collaboration Remote Work Doesn’t Have to Mean All-Day Video Calls by Marco Minervini , Darren Murph and Phanish Puranam September 09, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary When people work from home they are often expected to be virtually present during the regular workday. This can pose problems as people juggle the realities of working from home. GitLab, which has long worked all remotely, has shown that working from home can be highly flexible, mixing asynchronous and synchronous work as appropriate according to the importance of tacit communication at the task level. GitLab’s process is enabled by respecting: (1) clear boundaries at the task level between doing tasks and declaring them done; (2) the minimum viable change principe; and (3) the need for open communication. In addition, GitLab offers opportunities for socializing online, which proved helpful during the pandemic. Edwin Remsberg/Getty Images Leer en español The Covid-19 crisis has distanced people from the workplace, and employers have generally, if sometimes reluctantly, accepted that people can work effectively from home. As if to compensate for this distancing and keep the workplace alive in a virtual sense, employers have also encouraged people to stick closely to the conventional workday. The message is that working from home is fine and can even be very efficient — as long as people join video calls along with everyone else all through the day. But employees often struggle with the “workday” when working from home, because many have to deal with the competing requests coming from their family, also housebound. So how effective really is working from home if everyone is still working to the clock? Is it possible to ditch the clock? The answer seems to be that it is. Since before the pandemic we’ve been studying the remote work practices of the tech company GitLab to explore what it might look like if companies to break their employees’ chronological chains as well as their ties to the physical workplace. The challenge for GitLab From its foundation in 2014, GitLab has maintained an all-remote staff that now comprises more than 1,300 employees spread across over 65 countries. The “git” way of working uses tools that let employees work on ongoing projects wherever they are in the world and at their preferred time. The idea is that because it’s always “9 to 5” somewhere on the planet, work can continue around the clock, increasing aggregate productivity. That sounds good, but a workforce staggered in both time and space presents unique coordination challenges with wide-ranging organizational implications. The most natural way to distribute work across locations is to make it modular and independent, so that there is little need for direct coordination — workers can be effectively without knowing how their colleagues are progressing. This is why distributed work can be so effective for call centers and in patents evaluation. But this approach has its limits in development and innovation related activities, where the interdependencies between components of work are not always easy to see ahead of time. For this kind of complex work, co-location with ongoing communication is often a better approach because it offers two virtues: synchronicity and media richness. The time lag in the interaction between two or more individuals is almost zero when they are co-located, and, although the content of the conversation may be the same in both face-to-face and in virtual environments, the technology may not be fully able to convey soft social and background contextual cues — how easy is it to sense other people’s reactions in a group zoom meeting? All this implies that simply attempting to replicate online (through video or voice chat) what happened naturally in co-located settings is unlikely to be a winning or complete strategy. Yet this approach of “seeing the face” is the one that people seem to default to when forced to work remotely, as our survey of remote working practices in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns around the world has revealed. Tacit coordination There is a way through this dilemma. Our earlier research on offshoring of software development showed that drawing on tacit coordination mechanisms, such as a shared understanding of work norms and context, allows for coordination without direct communication. Coordination in this case happens through the observation of the action of other employees and being able to predict what they will do and need based on shared norms. It can occur either synchronously (where, for instance, two people might work on the same Google doc during the same time period), or asynchronously (when people make clear hand-offs of the document, and do not work on it when the other is). Software development organizations often opt for this solution and tend to rely extensively on shared repositories and document authoring tools, with systems for coordinating contributions (e.g., continuous integration and version control tools). But GitLab is quite unique in the for-profit sector in how extensively it relies on this third path not only for its coding but for how the organization itself functions. It leans particularly on asynchronous working because its employees are distributed across multiple time zones. As a result, although the company does use videoconferencing, almost no employee ever faces a day full of video meetings. How it works at GitLab At the heart of the engineering work that drives GitLab’s product development is the “git” workflow process invented by Linux founder Linus Torvalds. In this process, a programmer making a contribution to a code “forks” (copies) the code, so that it is not blocked to other users, works on it, and then makes a “merge request” to have the edited version replace the original, and this new version becomes available for other contributions. The process combines the possibility of distributed asynchronous work with a structure that checks for potential coordination failures and ensures clarity on decision rights. Completely electronic (which makes remote work feasible) and fully documented, it has become an important framework for distributed software development in both for-profit and open source contexts. GitLab has taken the git a step further, applying it also to managerial work that involves ambiguity and uncertainty. For instance, GitLab’s chief marketer recently outlined a vision for integrating video into the company’s year-ahead strategy. He requested asynchronous feedback from across the company within a fixed time window, and then scheduled a single synchronous meeting to agree on a final version of the vision. This vision triggered asynchronously input changes from multiple contributors to the company’s handbook pages relating to marketing objectives and key results that were merged on completion. GitLab’s high degree of reliance on asynchronous working is made possible by respecting the following three rules right down to the task level: 1. Separate responsibility for doing the task from the responsibility for declaring it done. In co-located settings, where employees are in the same office, easy communication and social cues allow them to efficiently resolve ambiguities and manage conflict around work responsibilities and remits. In remote settings, however, this can be difficult. In GitLab, therefore, every task is expected to have a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI), who is responsible for the completion of the task and has freedom in how it should be performed. The DRI, however, does not get to decide whether the task has been completed. That function is the responsibility of a “Maintainer,” who has the authority to accept or reject the DRI’s merge requests. Clarity on these roles for every task helps reduce confusions and delays and enables multiple DRIs to work in parallel in any way they want on different parts of a code by making local copies (“forking”). It is the Maintainer’s role to avoid unnecessary changes and maintain consistency in the working version of the document or code. In a non-software context, say in developing the GitLab handbook page on expenses policies, individual DRIs, who could be anyone in the company, would write specific policies in any way they choose, and their contributions would be accepted or rejected by the CFO acting in the capacity of Maintainer, who could also offer feedback (but not direction) to the DRIs. Once live, the merged page serves as the single source of truth on expenses policies unless or until someone else makes a new proposal. Once more, the Maintainer would approve, reject, or offer feedback on the new proposal. In contexts like this, we would expect people in traditional management positions to serve as Maintainers. 2. Respect the “minimum viable change” principle. When coordination is asynchronous, there is a risk that coordination failures may go undetected for too long – for instance, two individuals may be working in parallel on the same problem, making one of their efforts redundant, or one person may be making changes that that are incompatible with the efforts of another. To minimize this risk, employees are urged to submit the minimum viable change — an early stage, imperfect version of their suggested changes to code or documents. This makes it more likely that people will pick up on whether work is incompatible or being duplicated. Obviously, a policy of minimum viable changes should come with a “no shame” policy on delivering a temporarily imperfect output. In remote settings, the value of knowing what the other is doing as soon as possible is greater than getting the perfect product. 3. Always communicate publicly. As GitLab team members are prone to say, “we do not send internal email here.” Instead, employees post all questions and share all information on the Slack channels of their teams, and later the team leaders decide what information needs to be permanently visible to others. If so, it gets stored in a place available to everyone in the company, in an “issue” document or on a page in the company’s online handbook, which is accessible to anyone, in or outside the company. This rule means that people don’t run the risk of duplicating, or even inadvertently destroying the work of their colleagues. Managers devote a lot of time to curating the information generated through the work of employees they supervise and are expected to know better than others what information may be either broadly needed by a future team or that would be useful for people outside the company. Recognizing the limits of the GitLab approach However well implemented, asynchronous remote working of this kind cannot supply much in the way of social interaction. That’s a major failing, because social interaction is not only a source of pleasure and motivation for most, it is also where the “random encounters,” the serendipitous exchanges by the coffee machines and lift lobbies, create opportunities for ideas and information to flow and recombine. To minimize this limitation, GitLab provides occasions for non-task related interaction. Each day, team members may attend one of three optional social calls — staggered to be inclusive of time zones. The calls consist of groups of 8-10 people in a video chatroom, where they are free to discuss whatever they want (GitLab provides a daily starting question as icebreaker in case needed, such as: “What did you do over the weekend?” or “Where is the coolest place you ever traveled and why?”). In addition, GitLab has social slack groups: thematic chat rooms that employees with similar interests can participate in (such as: #cat, #dogs, #cooking, #mental_health_aware, #daily_gratitude, #gaming) and a #donut_be_strangers channel that allows strangers that have a mutual interest to have a coffee chat to get together. Of course, GitLab managers are under no illusion that these groups substitute perfectly for the kinds of rich social interactions outside work that people find rewarding. But they do help to keep employees connected, and, at a time when many employees have been working under confinement rules, this has proved very helpful in sustaining morale. *** Working from home in an effective way goes beyond just giving employees a laptop and a Zoom account. It encompasses practices intended to compensate or avoid the core limitations of working remotely, as well as fully leverage the flexibility that remote can offer — working not only from anywhere but at any desired time. We have focused on GitLab because it not only has extensive experience in remote working but also because it pursues an unusual mode of solving the intrinsic challenges of remote work. While some of GitLab’s core processes (like its long, remote onboarding process for new hires) and advantages (like the possibility of hiring across the world) cannot be fully reproduced in the short run in companies that will be just temporarily remote, there are others that any company can easily implement.

Economic development How to Harness the Digital Transformation of the Covid Era by Federica Saliola and Asif M. Islam September 24, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary The rapid spread of technology accelerated by the pandemic has led to a pressing need for businesses and governments to adapt. Many businesses, especially in developing economies, are digitally disconnected. They may not have access to workers with the right skills and face challenging business environments. Workers, on the other hand, have little protection and do not have the skills or flexibility in labor markets to adapt. To face these challenges, businesses need to embrace technology and upgrade training programs to equip their workers with the best skills. Technology can be a boon to society if businesses and governments prepare and adapt. The pandemic has pushed societies to an inflection point where embracing technology is no longer an option but a necessity. It has also made workers more vulnerable. With the right steps and actions, businesses and governments can take the crisis as an opportunity to build for the future.

Digital technology is at the center of today’s economic development debate due to its wide use during the Covid-19 outbreak. While there is no doubt that the pandemic is amplifying the adoption of new technologies, technological advancements were already changing the world over the past two decades, from living standards to the very nature of our work. Fears of robot-induced unemployment are on the rise as tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly performed using robots and artificial intelligence. The declining cost of machines threatens low-skill jobs and routine tasks — those most susceptible to automation and offshoring. Indeed, the number of robots operating worldwide is rising rapidly: by the end of 2020, there will be 3 million new industrial robots in operation, more than double the operational stock over the seven years spanning 2014-2020. Insight Center Technology and Transformation Sponsored by Lumen Examining the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. But technology can be a job creator, too. Increases in efficiency brought about by digital technology can help businesses expand. Digital platforms can create entirely new occupations and jobs. Businesses can reach out to remote markets lacking infrastructure. To reshape technology as a job creator, it’s important to understand what, exactly, the current wave of technology is changing, and how policy makers and businesses can adapt to it. The foundations of change. Even before the pandemic struck, some features of the state of technological progress were especially salient. First, technology was already disrupting production processes, especially through the rapid scale-up of digital platforms. Digital technology has been challenging the traditional boundaries of firms, changing global value chains and the geography of jobs. After all, technology decreases the costs of doing business, complementing investments in infrastructure, free trade agreements, and other liberalization efforts to reduce trade barriers, which in turn expands global value chains and changes the geography of jobs. New business models — digital platform firms — have been able to evolve rapidly from local start-ups to global behemoths, often with few employees or tangible assets. Digital platforms have enabled clusters of businesses to form in underdeveloped rural areas. Second, technology created seismic shifts in the mix of skills required to succeed in the labor market. While returns to routine, job-specific skills are declining, the premium for skills that cannot be replaced by robots has been increasing; these include cognitive skills such as critical thinking, as well as socio-behavioral skills such as managing and recognizing emotions that enhance teamwork. Earnings are higher for those who have a combination of these skills. The evolving world of work demands adaptable skills that enable workers to transfer more easily from one task to another. Since 2001, the share of employment in occupations intensive in non-routine cognitive and socio-behavioral skills has increased from 19% to 23% in emerging economies, and from 33% to 41% in advanced economies. Third, digital technology changed the terms of work. Rather than “standard” long-term contracts, digital technologies have given rise to more short-term work, often via online work platforms. These “gigs” make certain kinds of work more accessible and flexible. That said, despite the hype, the gig economy as of now has been slow to take over traditional occupations. The largest three global gig platforms — Freelancer of Australia, Upwork in the United States, and Zhubajia in China — have 60 million total users; only 0.3-0.5% of the active labor force participate in the gig economy globally. How will these changes play out in the post-Covid-19 world? It is likely that the pandemic will reinforce these pre-existing trends and increase the urgency of corresponding policy responses. Some points already seem clear. “Platform firms” are dominating markets even more. We are already seeing Amazon and Alibaba getting even bigger and stronger as brick-and-mortar stores are unable to compete. Companies will invest more in their ability to conduct business over the internet to be more resilient to potential lockdowns. Some “gig” jobs will also continue to grow. Firms may also have more incentive to invest in automation and reshore production to shield against value chain disruption. Many businesses relying on imported inputs are facing lack of intermediate goods as value chains are disrupted. They may need to ensure that supplies are less vulnerable to travel restrictions. Digital technology is also improving people’s ability to work from home, although the amenability to remote work — which depends on the type of jobs and tasks to be done, as well as digital capacity — varies significantly across and within countries. Jobs that are conducive to remote work are more prevalent in rich countries, among workers with higher levels of education, and in salaried full-time jobs. Women and young workers are significantly less likely to work remotely. Digital infrastructure is scarce or of low quality in many developing countries. Policies to prepare for the future of work. The rapid spread of technology accelerated by the pandemic has led to a pressing need for businesses and governments to adapt. Many businesses, especially in developing economies, are digitally disconnected. They may not have access to workers with the right skills and face challenging business environments. Workers, on the other hand, have little protection and do not have the skills or flexibility in labor markets to adapt. To face these challenges, businesses need to embrace technology and upgrade training programs to equip their workers with the best skills. Businesses can also consider apprenticeships to equip future workers with the right sets of skills. Governments have an arsenal of policy options at their disposal, from incentives and regulations to infrastructure projects and taxation. Key priorities should be: 1) ramping up investment in human capital (knowledge, skills, and health) and lifelong learning if workers are to adapt to future labor markets; 2) strengthening social protections, expanding safety net coverage, and reforming financing arrangements and labor market norms to facilitate work transitions and to reduce disincentives to the creation of formal jobs; 3) ensuring affordable access to the internet while adapting regulations to confront the challenges posed by digital platforms (such as data privacy and protection and competition rules); and 4) upgrading taxation systems to address tax avoidance and to create fiscal space for universal social protection and human capital development. Technology can be a boon to society if businesses and governments prepare and adapt. The pandemic has pushed societies to an inflection point where embracing technology is no longer an option but a necessity. It has also made workers more vulnerable. With the right steps and actions, businesses and governments can take the crisis as an opportunity to build for the future.

Innovation Industrial Firms Need to Give Their Customers a Digital Experience by Darren Perry , Gavin McGrath and Harpreet Singh September 22, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print Loading... Executive Summary We tend to think that industrial customers are old-fashioned in their tastes. But in fact the authors have research showing that they are hungry for digital innovation in their interactions with industrial suppliers. In May 2020 L.E.K.’s Annual Contractor Survey found that most industrials customers are already using digital tools for purchases and other activities. For example, the survey found that building and construction customers used digital channels 80% to 90% of the time to gather product information, read reviews, compare prices, and check product quality and availability. Across all industries, upwards of 40% of planned purchases are now made on websites or mobile apps. Indeed, many industrials leaders are calling for increased investment in digital customer experiences to maintain the health of the sales funnel, drive conversion, and maintain relationships — and there is ample evidence that such investments pay off. Leading industrial companies will think through their customer journey and how digital tools can enhance each step along the way. gremlin/Getty Images Leer en español When it comes to embracing digital solutions to engage customers, many industrial businesses have lagged behind consumer-facing enterprises. There are a variety of reasons for this gap, but what we often hear is that industrial customers simply aren’t ready for digital engagement. However, based on a large body of L.E.K. research, we beg to differ: customers are far more prepared for digital engagement than industrial leaders may realize. What’s more, Covid-19 is pushing once digitally-resistant customers to new levels of comfort with technology and raising expectations for how their business partners engage them. In May 2020 L.E.K.’s Annual Contractor Survey found that most industrials customers are already using digital tools for purchases and other activities. For example, the survey found that building and construction customers used digital channels 80% to 90% of the time to gather product information, read reviews, compare prices, and check product quality and availability. Across all industries, upwards of 40% of planned purchases are now made on websites or mobile apps. Further proliferation of digital tools, demographic trends, and the current pandemic will only drive these numbers higher. Indeed, many industrials leaders are calling for increased investment in digital customer experiences to maintain the health of the sales funnel, drive conversion, and maintain relationships — and there is ample evidence that such investments pay off. A recent L.E.K. global study revealed that 83% of the industrial firms that have been most successful at increasing revenue, market share or net promoter score (NPS), say they have made meaningful investments in digital customer engagement versus only 19% of less successful firms. Insight Center Technology and Transformation Sponsored by Lumen Examining the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. While many industrial firms are still playing digital catch-up, there are leaders out there who acknowledge customers’ digital readiness and are implementing a broad range of tools, technologies and updated processes to enhance the customer experience ― from demand generation to enabling purchases, to post-sale service and support. By setting the standard that customers are looking for, these leaders are securing a first-mover advantage. As customers increasingly demand digital experiences, industrial firms that hang back are likely to face an uphill battle as they try to retain mindshare and high customer satisfaction. It is important to note, however, that successful firms do not simply set up an e-commerce capability or throw money at the latest hot technology and hope something sticks. Rather, they analyze the customer journey and carefully select digital tools that are best suited to engage customers based on their individual needs and behaviors. Furthermore, meticulous segmentation of customer needs is an important input to evaluating the costs and benefits of employing emerging technologies. The typical customer journey begins pre-purchase, when a potential customers identifies a need, researches potential solutions and ultimately selects a product. Companies are applying a variety of digital tools to cut through the clutter and win customers at this critical stage. For example, Linde, a global industrial gases and engineering solutions company, developed an augmented reality (AR) application to engage customers and facilitate the sales conversion process. Their tool uses AR to give customers a “live” experience with the company’s cryogenic freezers by projecting an image of the freezer into the customer’s factory setup. While clarity on dimensions within the actual production space had previously driven a lengthy sales process, Linde’s use of AR has helped customers get over the conversion hump and improved the overall purchase experience. Likewise, building-products company Azek developed a 3D visualization tool to help customers see what their products will look like when projects are completed. The company then uses the data captured during this process to inform its customer relationship management (CRM) system, giving it a better understanding of channel and influencer touchpoints, driving stickier relationships, and offering valuable insights into emerging design trends. Once the customer has made a decision to purchase, they want to be able to carry out the transaction as effortlessly as possible, especially in situations where ongoing purchases are likely. Digital portals not only facilitate purchases but help companies meet their customers’ needs efficiently. Brenntag, a global chemical distribution company, turned to DigiB — an independent subsidiary tasked with rapidly advancing the company’s internal digital initiatives — to create its customer portal, Brenntag Connect. The self-service portal offers several standard features, including online ordering, order tracking, automation of repeat orders, and online quotes. But the portal’s machine-learning capabilities also allow it to optimize and customize purchases and make product recommendations, so that it becomes increasingly tailored to individual customer needs. Finally, post-purchase service and support are essential to ensuring customer loyalty. This is an area where industrial firms have an opportunity to shine, as many have begun to embrace Industry 4.0 and the underlying technologies that can provide customers with better ways to visualize their operations, monitor and diagnose issues remotely, and predict maintenance needs — all capabilities that have become more important during the pandemic. There are numerous examples of industrial firms that are leveraging IoT-enabled monitoring and predictive maintenance to enhance the customer experience post-purchase. One example is Atlas Copco, a Swedish industrial company, which improved equipment maintenance of its air compressors via a mobile app that allows customers to perform remote monitoring. This technology has reduced downtime, increased systems data gathering and improved customer retention. For industrial firms who have been slow to adopt a digital mindset, the time is now to make thoughtful investments; the divide between companies that are digitally advantaged and those that are not appears to be widening. A recent L.E.K. study of industrials firms found that while nearly 40% planned to increase their investments in digital customer experience as a result of Covid-19, firms who already claimed advantage in the area were twice as likely as their less-experienced peers to accelerate digitally. While most talk of customer experience innovation has focused on consumer-facing businesses, industrial firms are by no means immune to digital disruption in this area. Unless they can accommodate customer demands for digital tools and capabilities, using them to enhance every phase of the customer journey, they may well find themselves struggling to compete with faster-moving peers or new entrants for whom digital is a way of life.

Gender Don’t Let the Pandemic Set Back Gender Equality by Deepa Mahajan , Olivia White , Anu Madgavkar and Mekala Krishnan September 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary A new McKinsey analysis shows that women’s jobs are 1.8 times more vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic than men’s jobs: Women make up 39% of global employment but account for 54% of overall job losses as of May 2020. At the same time, they bear the burden of unpaid health and child care. This setback follows a five-year period in which tangible progress toward equality in work and society stagnated. Policy makers and business leaders need to act fast to push for greater gender equality, and CEOs can start with three immediate actions. First, they can track the data: Are job losses or requests for leave higher among women? Have promotion rates of women slowed? Second, they can take action. Companies that are rehiring should ensure that hiring practices consider gender diversity. Those investing in reskilling need to ensure female workers are actively encouraged to participate in such programs. And third, they can look for opportunities to increase gender equity throughout their ecosystem. Are your products and services designed to counter these regressive effects?

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Progress towards greater gender equality has been hesitant and halting over the past five years and the Covid-19 pandemic now risks sending it into reverse. Our analysis shows that women’s jobs are 1.8 times more vulnerable to this crisis than men’s jobs: Women make up 39% of global employment but account for 54% of overall job losses as of May 2020. At the same time, the burden of unpaid care, which has risen in the pandemic, falls disproportionately on women. This backwards move is not just a blow to women and societal progress but also to the economy and business. If no action is taken to counter the regressive effects, we estimate that global GDP growth could be $1 trillion lower in 2030 than it would be if women’s unemployment simply tracked that of men in each sector. Conversely, taking action now to advance gender equality could add $13 trillion to global GDP in 2030, compared with no action. A middle path — taking action only after the crisis has subsided — would boost the economy but reduce the potential opportunity by more than $5 trillion. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Beyond the economic impact, business leaders have a strong interest in furthering gender equality during this crisis. McKinsey research has found that gender diversity is a key to financial success: Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. Moreover, companies now pulling back on diversity and inclusion may be placing themselves at a disadvantage by limiting their access to talent, diverse skills, leadership styles, and perspectives. Reversing the regressive trend will require, among things, investment in education, family planning, maternal mortality prevention, digital inclusion, and unpaid care work. We estimate that incremental public, private, or household annual spending on these five areas would need to rise 20 to 30% in 2025 above the “business as usual” levels, or a total of $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion. By comparison, the economic benefits of narrowing gender gaps are six to eight times higher than the social spending required, we estimate. As we discuss below, investment is just the start. The Covid Setback Follows a Period of Scant Progress. Our estimates of the economics of gender parity date back to the McKinsey Global Institute’s (MGI’s) Power of Parity work in 2015, which analyzed 15 gender-equality indicators across four categories: equality in work, essential services and enablers of economic opportunity, legal protection and political voice, and physical security and autonomy. Using these indicators, MGI established a strong link between gender equality in society and gender equality in work — and has shown that the latter is not achievable without the former. Despite growing awareness of and support for greater gender equality, tangible progress toward equality in work and society stagnated in the five years between 2014 and 2019. Some indicators did improve, such as maternal mortality, the share of women in professional and technical jobs, and political representation. Overall, however, gender equality in work continued to lag behind gender equality in society. The level of female participation in the labor force has not budged — it sits at about two-thirds that of men — although there are regional and country variations. Now, with Covid-19, women have borne the brunt of the economic impact. Women’s employment is dropping faster than average, even accounting for the fact that women and men work in different sectors. The nature of work remains significantly gender specific, with women and men tending to cluster in different occupations. This shapes the gender implications of the pandemic: Our analysis shows that globally female jobs are 19% more at risk than male ones simply because women are disproportionately represented in sectors negatively affected by the Covid-19 crisis, such as accommodation and food service. Yet the gendered nature of work across industries only explains one-fourth of the difference between job-loss rates for men and women. In the United States, for example, women made up 46% of workers before Covid-19. Factoring in industry-mix effects suggests that women would make up 43% of job losses. However, unemployment data indicate that women make up 54% of the overall job losses to date. In India, women made up 20% of the workforce before Covid-19, and their share of job losses resulting from the industry mix alone is estimated at 17% — they actually account for 23% of overall job losses. What factors explain the other three-quarters? An important one is the burden of unpaid care, the demands of which have grown substantially during the pandemic. Women do an average of 75% of the world’s total unpaid-care work, including child care, caring for the elderly, cooking, and cleaning. As Covid-19 has disproportionately increased the time women spend on family responsibilities, women have dropped out of the workforce at a higher rate than explained by labor-market dynamics alone. Another factor could be Covid-19’s disproportionate impact on female entrepreneurship, including women-owned microenterprises in emerging economies, where such enterprises account for a high share of female labor-force participation. The crisis may have made some family resources scarce, including investment capital or digital devices that families must now share as children’s schooling has gone online. Attitudes also shape how women experience the economic consequences of a crisis relative to men: Traditional mindsets may be reflected in current decisions, at the organizational level or even within the family, about who gets to keep their jobs. For example, according to the global World Values Survey, more than half the respondents in many countries in South Asia and MENA agreed that men have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce. About one in six respondents in developed countries said the same. Three Areas for Action The strong message emerging from our research is that policy makers and business leaders need to act fast to push for greater gender equality. Overarching areas for action include reducing the gender imbalance in child care responsibility, for example through better recognition of unpaid work and rebalancing between men and women; closing the gender gap in digital inclusion, which is especially important as remote work and online shopping have become more prominent during the pandemic; and tackling attitudinal biases, potentially through campaigns and enlisting male champions to help drive home the idea that a larger number of women at work represents socially and economically beneficial progress. We recommend CEOs start with these three actions: 1. Track the data. Business leaders will need transparency on gendered regressive impacts within their company. Are job losses or requests for leave higher among women? Have promotion rates of women slowed? With new hiring, is the pre-Covid gender balance level being maintained, or is there slippage? Such information for the company as a whole can be accompanied by more detailed data by department and tenure band. 2. Take action. Many companies have already put in place policies to enable flexible working, but as lockdowns extend in many parts of the world, they will need to more actively consider how to factor the pandemic’s impact into performance reviews, prevent employee burnout, and ensure that traditional diversity practices, such as sponsorship programs or employee resource groups, are reinvented for a virtual world. Companies that are rehiring need to ensure that hiring practices consider gender diversity. Those investing in reskilling need to ensure female workers are actively encouraged to participate in such programs. In this Covid-19 period, leading by example can help, including encouraging employees to share the unpaid care burden openly and willingly, setting boundaries for those working remotely between office life and home life, and ensuring that your company shows care for the health and mental well-being of women employees. 3. Look for opportunities to increase gender equity throughout your corporate ecosystem. How can your products and services help counter regressive effects? Deliberately identifying such impacts and potential interventions can make a difference. For example, financial services firms can ensure their products reach women entrepreneurs, and technology firms can ensure their products are designed with diverse perspectives in mind. Companies can also take action to encourage gender diversity not just within their organizations but also more broadly across their supply chains and distribution channels. The evidence from our research is clear: Greater gender equality is good for the economy and society as a whole. If we act now to remove barriers to greater female labor-force participation and a bigger role in society, we can reap the economic and social benefits. If we delay, the benefits will be more meager, while allowing the disappointing status quo to continue will result in a backwards slide. Parity is powerful. It needs to move forward.

Innovation How Amazon Automated Work and Put Its People to Better Use by Alex Kantrowitz September 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Comment Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Loading... Executive Summary Replacing people with AI may seem tempting, but it’s also likely a mistake. Amazon’s “hands off the wheel” initiative might be a model for how companies can adopt AI to automate repetitive jobs, but keep employees on the payroll by transferring them to more creative roles where they can add more value to the company. Amazon’s choice to eliminate jobs but retain the workers and move them into new roles allowed the company to be more nimble and find new ways to stay ahead of competitors. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Leer en español At an automation conference in late 2018, a high-ranking banking official looked up from his buffet plate and stated his objective without hesitation: I’m here, he told me, to eliminate full-time employees. I was at the conference because after spending months researching how Amazon automates work at its headquarters, I was eager to learn how other firms thought about this powerful technology. After one short interaction, it was clear that some have it completely wrong. For the past decade, Amazon has been pushing to automate office work under a program now known as Hands off the Wheel. The purpose was not to eliminate jobs but to automate tasks so that the company could reassign people to build new products — to do more with the people on staff, rather than doing the same with fewer people. The strategy appears to have paid off: At a time when it’s possible to start new businesses faster and cheaper than ever before, Hands off the Wheel has kept Amazon operating nimbly, propelled it ahead of its competitors, and shown that automating in order to fire can mean missing big opportunities. As companies look at how to integrate increasingly powerful AI capabilities into their businesses, they’d do well to consider this example. The animating idea behind Hands off the Wheel originated at Amazon’s South Lake Union office towers, where the company began automating work in the mid-2010s under an initiative some called Project Yoda. At the time, employees in Amazon’s retail management division spent their days making deals and working out product promotions as well as determining what items to stock in its warehouses, in what quantities, and for what price. But with two decades’ worth of retail data at its disposal, Amazon’s leadership decided to use “the force” (machine learning) to handle the formulaic processes involved in keeping warehouses stocked. “When you have actions that can be predicted over and over again, you don’t need people doing them,” Neil Ackerman, an ex-Amazon general manager, told me. The project began in 2012, when Amazon hired Ralf Herbrich as its director of machine learning and made the automation effort one of his launch projects. Getting the software to be good at inventory management and pricing predictions took years, Herbrich told me, because his team had to account for low-volume product orders that befuddled its data-hungry machine-learning algorithms. By 2015, the team’s machine-learning predictions were good enough that Amazon’s leadership placed them in employees’ software tools, turning them into a kind of copilot for human workers. But at that point the humans could override the suggestions, and many did, setting back progress. Eventually, though, automation took hold. “It took a few years to slowly roll it out, because there was training to be done,” Herbrich said. If the system couldn’t make its own decisions, he explained, it couldn’t learn. Leadership required employees to automate a large number of tasks, though that varied across divisions. “In 2016, my goals for Hands off the Wheel were 80% of all my activity,” one ex-employee told me.” By 2018 Hands off the Wheel was part of business as usual. Having delivered on his project, Herbrich left the company in 2020. The transition to Hands off the Wheel wasn’t easy. The retail division employees were despondent at first, recognizing that their jobs were transforming. “It was a total change,” the former employee mentioned above said. “Something that you were incentivized to do, now you’re being disincentivized to do.” Yet in time, many saw the logic. “When we heard that ordering was going to be automated by algorithms, on the one hand, it’s like, ‘OK, what’s happening to my job?’” another former employee, Elaine Kwon, told me. “On the other hand, you’re also not surprised. You’re like, ‘OK, as a business this makes sense.’” Although some companies might have seen an opportunity to reduce head count, Amazon assigned the employees new work. The company’s retail division workers largely moved into product and program manager jobs — fast-growing roles within Amazon that typically belong to professional inventors. Product managers oversee new product development, while program managers oversee groups of projects. “People who were doing these mundane repeated tasks are now being freed up to do tasks that are about invention,” Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s departing CEO of Worldwide Consumer, told me. “The things that are harder for machines to do.” Had Amazon eliminated those jobs, it would have made its flagship business more profitable but most likely would have caused itself to miss its next new businesses. Instead of automating to milk a single asset, it set out to build new ones. Consider Amazon Go, the company’s checkout-free convenience store. Go was founded, in part, by Dilip Kumar, an executive once in charge of the company’s pricing and promotions operations. While Kumar spent two years acting as a technical adviser to CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s machine learning engineers began automating work in his old division, so he took a new lead role in a project aimed at eliminating the most annoying part of shopping in real life: checking out. Kumar helped dream up Go, which is now a pillar of Amazon’s broader strategy. If Amazon is any indication, businesses that reassign employees after automating their work will thrive. Those that don’t risk falling behind. In shaky economic times, the need for cost-cutting could make it tempting to replace people with machines, but I’ll offer a word of warning: Think twice before doing that. It’s a message I wish I had shared with the banker. Alex Kantrowitz is the author of Always Day One, a new book about the tech giants’ work culture.

Companies need to make sure that they have KPIs tracking how well the company is meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders it claims to recognize, not just shareholders and (sometimes) customers. HBR Staff/Kelsey Curtis/Unsplash Leer en español Like many firms, Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, expresses solidarity with its stakeholders in strong terms. Here’s its annual report: As a mining and metals company, we recognise the impact our business can have on our many stakeholders and the wider responsibilities this brings. We work hard to understand our stakeholders’ needs and expectations. We want our success to allow us to invest to meet our obligations to our employees, our customers, suppliers, local communities, and host governments, as well as to generate superior returns for our shareholders. [emphasis added] Yet on the 24th of May 2020, Rio Tinto blasted into oblivion the caves of the Juukan Gorge, a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where the company mines iron ore. Rio Tinto did this in the pursuit of further expansion and in full knowledge of the site’s existence and importance. Not to proceed, the CEO has explained, would have cost the company $135 million. He was under pressure to maximize profits from iron ore. The Australian community has reacted with horror. News outlets and social media have been running hot on the issue. The company’s shareholders around the world have voiced their outrage. Large pension funds, including Hesta and Australian Super (Australia’s largest), have demanded answers from Rio Tinto’s board. The result – so far – has been that the CEO and two other senior executives have been forced to resign in disgrace. The predictions are that there’s more fallout to come. How could something like this have happened? Metrics vs. stakeholders You’ve no doubt heard the saying “what gets measured gets managed.” And it’s true. Why? Because what gets measured, gets noticed. CEOs and other executives respond to what boards and shareholders notice. You can see this in the mining industry where levels of safety are measured, highlighted by boards and trumpeted, when good, by CEOs. Measuring something raises its profile. You would expect that Rio Tinto’s key metrics would include measures for how well it is performing on the dimensions that each of its identified stakeholders value. But do they? The company publishes its “key performance indicators” (KPIs) in its annual report; it highlights eight accountability measures. Of these, six relate to shareholders and concern metrics around profit, return on capital employed, and debt. One employee-related KPI relates concerns safety, measured by “all injury frequency rate.” The remaining KPI, “total greenhouse gas emissions intensity,” is the only one that concerns community. It’s clear that there’s a mismatch between the stakeholders that Rio Tinto marks as vital and its measures of corporate success. To take a specific example from its annual report, the company acknowledges “suppliers” as “vital to our business success” yet fails to list a single KPI to track performance in that space. Is Rio Tinto an exception? To answer this question, I reviewed the annual reports of five other mining companies: BHP (the world’s largest), Fortescue, Newcrest, Woodside Petroleum, and Santos. (All six are within the 20 largest Australian companies by market capitalization.) Like Rio Tinto, BHP publishes its “key performance indicators.” There are nine. Five of these relate to shareholders, two to employees (both about safety), and two to the community. Fortescue goes one step further and reduces its “key performance indicators” to a list of three. Clearly, Rio Tinto is not the only big Australian miner whose metrics don’t match its rhetoric. Miners aren’t the only offenders. Commonwealth Bank (Australia’s largest) identifies “customers, community, our people, and shareholders” as its key stakeholders in its annual report. But when it comes to the “key metrics” in its Annual Report report it it mentions eight, of which seven relate to shareholders and one to customers. This is despite the 2018 finding by a Royal Commission (high level inquiry) into banking misconduct. One clear issue the Commission had identified in its report was that banks gave too little attention to monitoring organizational culture and over- emphasized measuring corporate profit.

But that’s only the beginning of what robots will do. The real benefit of retail robots will be the opportunity to capture more granular data about the products on the shelves and customer buying patterns, which can increase efficiency and accuracy in inventory management. The key is using retail robots as data-collectors within an internet-of-things (IoT), which is best thought of as a complex network of connected devices, objects, and sensors gathering voluminous data that is analyzed in the cloud or with edge computing.

Insight Center Technology and Transformation Sponsored by Lumen Examining the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. With robots in stores, retailers already have the beginnings of a holistic IoT solution. For example, Auchan Retail Portugal, a large European grocery retailer, is launching autonomous shelf-monitoring technology, which uses robots, in its supermarkets and hypermarkets. As the robots move around the stores, they capture photos of every shelf and aisle, which are then digitized and converted into metrics and insights about out-of-stock merchandise and pricing. Such detailed data is incredibly valuable in retail, where understanding and anticipating consumer demand is essential. For example, Stitch Fix, which provides just-for-you clothing choices to shoppers at home, touts its data science in multiple facets of its business model, from product recommendation to inventory management and fashion design. For traditional retailers, however, merely tracking what consumers purchase does not paint the entire picture. The real competitive advantage for retailers comes in knowing what they couldn’t purchase but wanted to. That’s where robots in the aisles come in. Gathering Data at the Top of the Marketing Funnel Robots roaming stores gather data at the “top of the funnel” based on what is — and is not — on the shelves. Their continuous scans provide a more holistic view of customers’ retail experiences. For example, shelf inventories reveal what’s in stock in ample quantities, what’s dwindling in supply, and what’s out-of-stock — all of which indicate consumer preferences and action. In the not-too-distant future, robots may be able to do more than report on inventory levels and perform price checks to ensure accuracy and consistency. Consider a hypothetical scenario of a retail robot scanning grocery store aisles and detecting that supplies of sugar-free peanut butter are diminishing at twice the rate of regular peanut butter. That real-time discovery then triggers an automated order for more sugar-free peanut butter to be sent to a specific store. By detecting sudden and unexpected shifts in inventory, the robot would be able to respond quickly without human intervention. That’s not unlike what happens in high-frequency trading, which uses algorithms to detect and capitalize on small, momentary discrepancy in stock prices, which can aggregate into huge profits over time. For retailers, the money to be made right now is in avoiding these inventory aberrations that lead to out-of-stocks, which have a huge price tag — a whopping $1 trillion worldwide, according to industry estimates. In addition to lost sales, customers are disappointed by out-of-stocks, which can lead to diminished shopper loyalty. During the Covid-19 pandemic, home essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies have had widespread out-of-stocks. Retailers eventually imposed limits on purchases per visit, but not before facing chronically empty shelves. But what if retailers had been able to get an early indication of mass purchases of products such as toilet paper? If a robot in the aisle had detected an unexpected decline in toilet paper supplies, that could have led to better inventory management early on, with increased shipments from warehouses and limits on purchases to quell hoarding. Using IoT to Improve Other Industries Advance detection of low inventory and out-of-stocks can also help improve efficiency and customer experiences in other industries, such as air travel. For example, unexpected airplane maintenance can delay flights, not only because of the sudden need to make a repair, but also if the required part or component is not on hand. Using an IoT approach to aircraft maintenance would mean better inventory management of parts and other supplies, and potentially the capability for the aircraft itself to signal a need for repair or replacement before the plane is taken out of service. Using sensors and AI for predictive modeling and maintenance is already being explored in applications from manufacturing to water systems. Robotics has made inroads into numerous industries for years, from automotive assembly operations to robotic arms that lift heavy items in warehouses. In some hotels, robots carry luggage and act as digital concierges. More recently, due to the pandemic, robots have rolled into hospitals with nonsurgical applications such as sanitizing corridors and rooms and delivering supplies, including blood samples to be tested in the lab. Autonomous robotic cleaners are also making their way into commercial spaces from office buildings to airports. Until recently, robots in retail have mostly worked behind the scenes. For example, Amazon uses robots in its fulfillment centers to improve efficiency as well as safety (robots can’t get hurt moving heavy pallets); Amazon says robots have helped it store 40% more inventory in its centers. Meanwhile, Kroger, the largest grocery retailer in the U.S., is launching a network of automated warehouses that use robotics and digital technology to improve its ability to meet customer demands. Rethinking Retail In this hypercompetitive industry, in which margins get squeezed across brick-and-mortar, online, and omnichannel competitors, retailers must continue to rely on innovation and technology to differentiate themselves and improve their chances of survival. One of the early waves of retail innovation was e-commerce. While hardly a new trend now, e-commerce did make further inroads because of the pandemic as more shoppers stayed home and purchased online with greater frequency. In fact, the pandemic may have accelerated the shift from physical stores to digital shopping by as much as five years. Retail innovators also have been rethinking brick-and-mortar to showcase products and give consumers an opportunity to experience new offerings. Now, the latest step on the path toward greater innovation is propelling retailers deeper into IoT to improve inventory management and predictive modeling. As product cycles speed up, retailers will need to become even more agile in identifying microtrends in consumer behavior to produce, distribute, and supply the goods and services that customers want right now. The key to it all may very well be a robot roaming freely, bringing data from the consumer touchpoint in the store aisle into the data management system in the cloud.

Research points to tips on how to better build rapport even when people can’t see your face. They include modulating your voice, practicing active listening, ramping up gestures and body language, mirroring, aligning your toes, and learning how to smile with your eyes.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Nonverbal communication in the workplace is extremely important. Whether you’re trying to sell a car, pitch a project to your boss, or nail a job interview, what you convey beyond words can determine the difference between success and failure. This makes communication in the age of Covid-19 more challenging for the obvious reason that masks, a necessary component of fighting the pandemic, hide the parts of our faces that display facial expressions — particularly those micro expressions that we use without thinking to convey as well as perceive sincerity, trustworthiness, and good intentions. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share In situations where there’s an incongruity between what’s spoken verbally and what’s displayed nonverbally, people instinctively lend greater weight to the latter. Unfortunately, if your expressions are concealed by a mask, that can happen more often. A case in point is a 2013 study which found that when doctors wore face masks during consultations, patients had more negative perceptions of them. Of course, from a public health perspective, wearing masks is a must in the midst of this pandemic, and we mustn’t stop doing so just because they present certain challenges. Here, then, are some tips for how to communicate effectively and build rapport while still doing your part to keep everyone safe. Avoid Clear Masks Unless Necessary Clear masks may seem like a good solution, but some people find them unsettling, and they also tend to fog up. A situation when it may still be worth using clear masks is when the person you’re speaking to is deaf or when you’re addressing an audience that may include deaf individuals. Otherwise, it’s usually best to stick with regular, non-clear masks and compensate for the covering up of your micro expressions by using the other suggestions provided here. Practice Your “Mask Voice” The quality of your voice makes a big difference in how people respond emotionally to what you say, and this is true in both personal and professional interactions. Even if we say the exact same things but in different tones, people will respond differently. When we wear masks, our voices must play an even bigger role than usual. Fortunately, there are research-backed ways to make them more effective. I call it using our “mask voice,” and I use the acronym PAVE to help people remember four key elements: pause, accentuate, volume, and emotion. Pause: Normally, visual cues of the mouth help us to see when a speaker is pausing for a response. Since we can’t see that now, make a conscious effort to noticeably pause here and there to give people opportunities to jump in or respond. This also breaks up your message into digestible chunks. Accentuate: Avoid monotony by accentuating key phrases and information, but don’t always accentuate in the same way. Use different intonation. Volume: Masks have a slight muffling effect so speak up (but don’t shout, obviously). Emotion: In appropriate moments, try to make your voice more expressive by conveying positive emotions like excitement, awe, gratitude, and sympathy. Do this in moderation since you don’t want to come across as if you’re performing Shakespeare. Practice Active Listening Now that you’ve adjusted your voice, you can also adjust the actual words you use. This starts with active listening. When your conversation partner is speaking, show interest by periodically nodding and making sounds of understanding like “Mm hmm.” If the speaker pauses but isn’t finished talking, you can again affirm understanding or interest with phrases like “I’m listening” or “And then what happened?” If the speaker expresses emotions, especially negative ones (e.g. frustration or disappointment), paraphrasing can be a powerful way to affirm their feelings. You can start with a phrase like “So do you mean…” or “What I hear you saying is…” and then say what you think they’re feeling with your own words instead of just parroting what they said. This kind of active listening and paraphrasing helps build rapport and increases your perceived likeability. Use Gestures and Body Language Let’s move on to body language. Try to make full use of gestures while speaking to convey meaning and emotion—a little more than usual wouldn’t hurt. Obviously, you don’t want to overdo it to the point where it distracts your audience or you look like a mime. A good rule of thumb would be to increase the level of your gesturing by about 10%. Since we can’t shake hands, one gesture you should use often to build rapport is waving your hand when greeting people. The ritual of handshaking goes back centuries and served important psychological functions, for example, showing that you weren’t carrying any weapons and could therefore be trusted. While the reason for handshaking has evolved, the importance of it has not. A friendly, animated wave can go a long way towards conveying that same sense of goodwill. Mirror Your Counterpart Mirroring is a non-verbal behavior that involves imitating the body language of a person or group of people with whom you are interacting. A lot of mirroring happens naturally and unconsciously. Studies have shown that it helps build rapport between individuals, and the practice of doing it intentionally has become more popular for this reason. As with gesturing, however, you don’t want to overdo it to the point where it becomes noticeable or unnatural. In this case, less is more. Keep the Two T’s Aligned The “Two T’s” stands for the “toes and torso.” During interactions, your feet have a natural tendency to reveal what’s really going on in your mind. So if you’re in a meeting but are hungry, your toes might start pointing in the direction of the door. This can be subconsciously interpreted as a lack of interest so keep your toes and torso aligned and facing the person or people with whom you’re interacting. Side note: if you notice the other person’s toes facing away from you, you definitely don’t want to mirror them. Smile with Your Eyes Smiling is an extremely important form of nonverbal communication in business as well as in socializing. Research shows that smiles with eyes that look angry, fearful, sad, or neutral are perceived as not happy and, therefore, not indicative of the friendliness we associate with happy smiles. When we’re wearing masks it is therefore even more important to “smile with your eyes” — or “smize” as model Tyra Banks calls it — if you want to create positive feelings. Simply put, when you smile there’s a wrinkling that occurs at the outer edges of your eyes. This happens more naturally and noticeably for some people than others, so I recommend intentionally wrinkling your eyes when you’re wearing your mask, even if it feels awkward at first. To get it right, practice in front of a mirror with your mask on. As long as you’re actually smiling with your mouth when you do this, it should look natural. Know When to Zoom Generally speaking, in-person communication is preferable to video conference – even when you have to wear masks during the former and you don’t during the latter. With offices open or opening around the world, you’ll have to make more choices going forward. And there may still be situations in which Zoom or other tools make more sense, such as if you’re part of a high-risk group or living with someone who is, or if slides and graphics play a big role in your presentation. Masks are here to stay for the foreseeable future. But the time and effort you put into internalizing these tips won’t just pay off during the pandemic. They’ll continue to help you communicate more effectively when we’re all able to show our full faces again.

Companies need to make sure that they have KPIs tracking how well the company is meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders it claims to recognize, not just shareholders and (sometimes) customers. HBR Staff/Kelsey Curtis/Unsplash Leer en español Like many firms, Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, expresses solidarity with its stakeholders in strong terms. Here’s its annual report: As a mining and metals company, we recognise the impact our business can have on our many stakeholders and the wider responsibilities this brings. We work hard to understand our stakeholders’ needs and expectations. We want our success to allow us to invest to meet our obligations to our employees, our customers, suppliers, local communities, and host governments, as well as to generate superior returns for our shareholders. [emphasis added] Yet on the 24th of May 2020, Rio Tinto blasted into oblivion the caves of the Juukan Gorge, a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where the company mines iron ore. Rio Tinto did this in the pursuit of further expansion and in full knowledge of the site’s existence and importance. Not to proceed, the CEO has explained, would have cost the company $135 million. He was under pressure to maximize profits from iron ore. The Australian community has reacted with horror. News outlets and social media have been running hot on the issue. The company’s shareholders around the world have voiced their outrage. Large pension funds, including Hesta and Australian Super (Australia’s largest), have demanded answers from Rio Tinto’s board. The result – so far – has been that the CEO and two other senior executives have been forced to resign in disgrace. The predictions are that there’s more fallout to come. How could something like this have happened? Metrics vs. stakeholders You’ve no doubt heard the saying “what gets measured gets managed.” And it’s true. Why? Because what gets measured, gets noticed. CEOs and other executives respond to what boards and shareholders notice. You can see this in the mining industry where levels of safety are measured, highlighted by boards and trumpeted, when good, by CEOs. Measuring something raises its profile. You would expect that Rio Tinto’s key metrics would include measures for how well it is performing on the dimensions that each of its identified stakeholders value. But do they? The company publishes its “key performance indicators” (KPIs) in its annual report; it highlights eight accountability measures. Of these, six relate to shareholders and concern metrics around profit, return on capital employed, and debt. One employee-related KPI relates concerns safety, measured by “all injury frequency rate.” The remaining KPI, “total greenhouse gas emissions intensity,” is the only one that concerns community. It’s clear that there’s a mismatch between the stakeholders that Rio Tinto marks as vital and its measures of corporate success. To take a specific example from its annual report, the company acknowledges “suppliers” as “vital to our business success” yet fails to list a single KPI to track performance in that space. Is Rio Tinto an exception? To answer this question, I reviewed the annual reports of five other mining companies: BHP (the world’s largest), Fortescue, Newcrest, Woodside Petroleum, and Santos. (All six are within the 20 largest Australian companies by market capitalization.) Like Rio Tinto, BHP publishes its “key performance indicators.” There are nine. Five of these relate to shareholders, two to employees (both about safety), and two to the community. Fortescue goes one step further and reduces its “key performance indicators” to a list of three. Clearly, Rio Tinto is not the only big Australian miner whose metrics don’t match its rhetoric. Miners aren’t the only offenders. Commonwealth Bank (Australia’s largest) identifies “customers, community, our people, and shareholders” as its key stakeholders in its annual report. But when it comes to the “key metrics” in its Annual Report report it it mentions eight, of which seven relate to shareholders and one to customers. This is despite the 2018 finding by a Royal Commission (high level inquiry) into banking misconduct. One clear issue the Commission had identified in its report was that banks gave too little attention to monitoring organizational culture and over- emphasized measuring corporate profit. In that context you would have expected the bank to have developed a KPI that measured how well it served its employees. *** A stakeholder focus has been endorsed by none other than the U.S. Business Roundtable.

If a robot in the aisle had detected an unexpected decline in toilet paper supplies, that could have led to better inventory management early on, with increased shipments from warehouses and limits on purchases to quell hoarding. Using IoT to Improve Other Industries Advance detection of low inventory and out-of-stocks can also help improve efficiency and customer experiences in other industries, such as air travel. For example, unexpected airplane maintenance can delay flights, not only because of the sudden need to make a repair, but also if the required part or component is not on hand. Using an IoT approach to aircraft maintenance would mean better inventory management of parts and other supplies, and potentially the capability for the aircraft itself to signal a need for repair or replacement before the plane is taken out of service. Using sensors and AI for predictive modeling and maintenance is already being explored in applications from manufacturing to water systems. Robotics has made inroads into numerous industries for years, from automotive assembly operations to robotic arms that lift heavy items in warehouses. In some hotels, robots carry luggage and act as digital concierges. More recently, due to the pandemic, robots have rolled into hospitals with nonsurgical applications such as sanitizing corridors and rooms and delivering supplies, including blood samples to be tested in the lab. Autonomous robotic cleaners are also making their way into commercial spaces from office buildings to airports. Until recently, robots in retail have mostly worked behind the scenes. For example, Amazon uses robots in its fulfillment centers to improve efficiency as well as safety (robots can’t get hurt moving heavy pallets); Amazon says robots have helped it store 40% more inventory in its centers. Meanwhile, Kroger, the largest grocery retailer in the U.S., is launching a network of automated warehouses that use robotics and digital technology to improve its ability to meet customer demands. Rethinking Retail In this hypercompetitive industry, in which margins get squeezed across brick-and-mortar, online, and omnichannel competitors, retailers must continue to rely on innovation and technology to differentiate themselves and improve their chances of survival. One of the early waves of retail innovation was e-commerce. While hardly a new trend now, e-commerce did make further inroads because of the pandemic as more shoppers stayed home and purchased online with greater frequency. In fact, the pandemic may have accelerated the shift from physical stores to digital shopping by as much as five years. Retail innovators also have been rethinking brick-and-mortar to showcase products and give consumers an opportunity to experience new offerings. Now, the latest step on the path toward greater innovation is propelling retailers deeper into IoT to improve inventory management and predictive modeling. As product cycles speed up, retailers will need to become even more agile in identifying microtrends in consumer behavior to produce, distribute, and supply the goods and services that customers want right now. The key to it all may very well be a robot roaming freely, bringing data from the consumer touchpoint in the store aisle into the data management system in the cloud.

Argenti October 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Print Executive Summary Companies are increasingly under pressure to take a stand on high-profile political and social issues. Sometimes there is a clear moral issue at hand and the consequences will be most severe if you don’t say anything. At other times, it may not be so clear. But ultimately if your words don’t match your actions, they will be perceived as inauthentic, hypocritical, or woke-washing. Before deciding which issues to speak out on, companies and leaders should ask three questions: 1) Does the issue align with your corporate mission and values? 2) Can you meaningfully influence the issue? 3) Will your constituents (employees, customers, community) agree with speaking out? Anton Shunkov/Getty Images Leer en español Black Lives Matter. Trade policy. Immigration. Over the last four years, companies have been under pressure from their constituencies — employees, customers, investors, and the communities in which they operate — to take a public stand on high-profile political and social movements. According to research from the Edelman Trust Barometer, 54% of employees globally believe that CEOs should speak publicly on controversial political and social issues they care about. Similarly, 53% of consumers agree that every brand has a responsibility to get involved in at least one social issue that does not directly impact its business. It is impossible and impractical for companies and executives to speak out on every issue. With some, there will be an obvious moral reason to take a stand. At other times, it may not be so clear. Thus, the question for companies and C-level executives is when should you speak out? If you choose to do so, how should you prepare and position your response? Should your company take the lead in driving the conversation, or is it better to partner with other organizations to have a more meaningful influence on the issue? Or should you instead avoid speaking out at all? To help companies make this decision, I’ve created the following framework, based on my research and consulting experience over the last five years. Three Questions to Guide Your Approach To begin, your company should ask the following questions: Does the issue align with your company’s strategy? Your strategy is based in part on the company’s mission and values. If there is a misalignment with the issue you’re speaking out on, your statements will be viewed by your constituents — and the public — as inauthentic. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? Does your company have the expertise and resources to make a difference? And are you willing to put your money where your mouth is? If not, but you speak out anyway, you risk being seen as hypocritical or as “woke-washing.” Will your constituencies agree with speaking out? Obviously, your company greatly reduces its risk of disrupting future business if key constituencies generally agree with the proposed stance. When these constituencies disagree with each other, however, you must discuss and carefully weigh their relative importance to your business (e.g. a small customer segment with limited power vs. your largest investor). A Framework to Guide Your Response The answers to the above questions are certainly not easy to determine and will contain a lot of company-specific nuance. However, executive teams must try to get to a “Yes” or “No” on each one (even if it’s a “mostly yes” or “mostly no.”) If you answer yes to all three questions, then you have the opportunity to speak out as a leader on the issue at hand. Starbucks did this after a notorious 2018 incident in which a Philadelphia store manager called 911 after two Black men who were refused access to the bathroom refused to leave the store, resulting in their arrest. After protests and online outrage, Starbucks apologized and issued a new bathroom policy. It also shut down 8,000 stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training that was shaped by a number of experts, including the Equal Justice Initiative Founder and Executive Director Bryan Stevenson and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill. Starbucks also offered to share this training with other companies. Starbucks’ response checked “yes” to all three questions: Does the issue align with your company strategy? In its mission, Starbucks describes itself as “a third-place environment, where everyone is welcome, and we can gather, as a community, to share great coffee and deepen human connection.” All customers must feel comfortable in Starbucks stores and this racist act happened in a store – Starbucks had to speak out. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? By developing new anti-bias training, instructing 175,000 baristas, and sharing it with their peers, Starbucks had a meaningful opportunity to influence how people of color are treated in retail stores. By shutting down all stores for training, Starbucks demonstrated its commitment. Will your constituencies agree with speaking out? Starbucks key constituencies were aligned. Customers and community members were outraged by the incident. And as one employee put it: “It’s a horrible thing that happened to those two men … that we get to be part of a group of people wanting to do something systemically different is awesome.” Starbucks’ actions in the spring of 2018 were very different from three years earlier, when the company, in partnership with USA Today, launched its widely panned “Race Together” campaign in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. As part of that initiative, baristas were instructed to write “Race Together” on cups and engage customers in conversations about race. This initiative was generally perceived as a marketing stunt. If we apply the framework to this initiative: Does the issue align with company strategy? Discussing race in a forced and unmediated setting is not part of the company’s strategy or mission, and it largely made employees and customers feel uncomfortable. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? Starbucks could not have hoped to meaningfully influence the issue of racism in America through the “Race Together” campaign, in part because race isn’t an issue (racism is), and largely because the campaign didn’t have concrete aims/pledges to do anything beyond talking. Will your constituents agree with speaking out? While many Starbucks constituents are likely supportive of ending racism in America, they were not supportive of discussing race in Starbucks stores. As one post on Twitter stated: “Not sure what @Starbucks was thinking. I don’t have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train. #RaceTogether.” When your answer to each of the questions is no, I recommend not speaking out at all, but not every case is so clear cut. Many times, companies will find themselves with a mix of yes/no answers to the three questions. If your executive team answers “Yes” to two of the questions, but “No” to a third, then you should consider carefully your next steps before speaking out. You might want to approach the situation as a follower, letting others take the lead. This may include joining a coalition of companies or an industry association that has decided to speak out on the issue. Or perhaps you might have a division or individual product or brand that decides to speak on the issue, rather than the company as a whole. If your executive team answers “Yes” to only one of the questions, but “No” to the other two, then I suggest you do not speak out, but continue to monitor the situation – things might change that turn a “No” into a “Yes” with time and lead you to speak out. How Should You Prepare and Position Your Response? While news events may feel unexpected, the underlying issues — from racism to gun violence to sexism — are often long simmering. Companies can and should discuss in advance which issues they have a view on and create a playbook for their response. First, assign a forecasting team to monitor and research hot-button issues, homing in on the ones that are most likely to align with or impact your business strategy. The team should include representatives from your marketing, communications, strategy, and legal (usually compliance) departments as well as someone from the C-suite. It should research other organizations or individuals who have spoken out on a given topic and what the outcome has been. The team should also create a competitive map: Who are the most influential players speaking out on the issue? How does your influence compare to theirs? Finally, the team should prepare answers to the following questions: What is your company’s mission, vision, value set, and strategy? What are the social/political/environmental threats to these elements of strategy? Where and how can you meaningfully influence the discussion to neutralize these threats? What will your voice uniquely add to the discussion? Which issues do you have constituency alignment on? Second, create a playbook for speaking out on the issues identified above. Use a communication strategy framework to guide your thinking here: Who are your key constituencies? What do you want them to do/think/understand about the issue? What do they need to know? How can you measure success? Then develop a detailed game plan for when you need to mobilize quickly. Decide in advance who needs to be part of the decision-making process. Executives should be aware of the company’s stance on relevant issues and know where to access talking points. Review the playbook at least annually with your executive team and update as needed. Don’t be afraid to toss or overhaul playbooks that are no longer relevant. Companies need to understand that expectations of business are changing from society, consumers, employees, and investors. Even if they have not yet been confronted with a decision to speak out on a potentially controversial topic, they will likely find themselves needing to make this decision in the future. This framework offers a business case for how to respond. But companies also need to weigh the morality around a given response, the intensity of emotion associated with a specific constituency, and what the consequences of no response might mean. Using this methodical approach, companies will be able to determine which issues are most relevant to their business to maximize the effectiveness of their actions both to make a positive impact on society and their bottom line. In the end, however, the philosopher Plato may offer the best advice for companies looking beyond the business case for speaking out: “Wise men [sic] speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.” Paul A.

For many companies, well-positioned Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that hold strong relationships with workplace leaders can be part of the solution. The author recommends six actions for EAP professionals, programs, and the workplaces they support. Martin Barraud/Getty Images Leer en español It may surprise some employers to know that when employees experience racism and/or other forms of discrimination and oppression, one of the places they can turn for help is their Employee Assistance Program or EAP. While EAPs are thought of more often for use by employees for short-term counseling and referrals to help employees manage personal problems so that they don’t interfere with work performance and productivity, it is important to remember that EAPs also provide workplaces with services including organizational assessment, management consultation and strategic crisis prevention and response. It is precisely because of this mix of individual and organizational level of services that EAPs are in a unique position to help employees work through the trauma of racism and to provide workplace leaders with an invaluable insider view of complex workplace problems, including racism. As a professor and chair of the only Masters in Social Work (MSW) program with a focus on preparing graduates for careers in the field of Employee Assistance, I have received numerous calls over the past several months from employers asking for advise and consultation regarding how they can work to challenge — and dismantle — their own systems that uphold racist views and policies. Additionally, I have heard from many EAP managers and counselors, also asking how their EAPs can play a more significant role in helping workplaces respond to systemic racism. On more than one occasion, EAP professionals have confided that they felt powerless after working one-on-one with an employee who is suffering effects of racism. Simply offering stress management support did not feel adequate, and they lacked a line of communication to management to report the need for systemic change. Similarly, EAP managers are receiving calls from managers and supervisors whose employees are requesting workplace meetings to discuss issues or race and racism. And workplace leaders are asking how their EAPs can play a bigger role in helping to influence system-level change to combat racism. In response, I’ve developed a list of six things employers need to do to build a more effective partnership with their EAPs that will not only support individual employees during this period of massive social change, but also support managers and supervisors and help to ensure meaningful and sustained long-term reform. 1. Encourage a data-driven approach to customized EAP services. A data-driven approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion within our EAPs and broader workplaces is critical if we are to make real impact in dismantling systemic racism. You need to know who is — and isn’t — using your EAP. You cannot identify service utilization gaps without data. Is your EAP collecting data on race, ethnicity, income, and gender identity? How are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who sought out EAP services being helped? What are the outcomes? Data can be reported to the workplace in the aggregate so that individual employee demographics and identities are protected and kept anonymous from employers. 2. Support an EAP counselor and affiliate network that is responsive to your workplace. Employers should encourage EAPs to conduct an audit of their staff and counselors — not just to see if they are accepting certain health insurance plans, but to see who is providing the services. EAPs often ask if clients have a preference for counselor gender and language, but is your EAP asking clients for a preference with regard to race and/or ethnicity? And if they did ask, could the EAP realistically meet their preference? Are EAP counselors trained to provide culturally responsive and culturally relevant services? In addition to auditing the EAP counselor/affiliate network, take a good look at the EAP marketing and promotional materials that are being shared with your employees. Are these materials inclusive and do they provide an accurate reflection of the racial demographics of your workplace, in addition to other characteristics? If not, work in partnership with your EAP to support revising materials, both in print and online, to better align with your employee demographics. 3. Encourage managers and other leaders to take advantage of the EAP for themselves. Many managers and supervisors are finding themselves eager to learn more about racism and implicit bias, but fearful to admit what they don’t know or to make a mistake. Assume that they would all benefit from education and consultation. EAPs can play a role by equipping leaders with resources so they can do their own learning and introspection, and feel more competent in their abilities to lead difficult conversations about race. Encourage managers and workplace leaders who have used EAP services in the past to share their story. Demonstrating leadership buy-in and commitment is one of the best ways to increase EAP utilization within a work organization. 4. Create a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion advisory committee that includes your EAP. A diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) advisory committee can help companies consider their public stance against racism and how it helps — or hurts — employees. The EAP should work in partnership with this committee to assess needs and help leaders create answers without placing unfair burden on BIPOC. Additionally, the EAP can provide de-identified examples of employees’ first-hand accounts of racism to help workplace leaders understand the deep impact of racism within a workplace and potential points throughout the work organization for support, intervention, and change. 5. Recognize racism as trauma. Racism is a form of trauma, and EAPs need to apply a trauma-informed approach to all of their work, actively working to resist re-traumatizing a person or community when providing support and providing culturally responsive counseling and support services to individuals who have been traumatized by racism. PsychHub created a list of resources that serve as a starting point to inform workplaces about how to provide more trauma-informed and culturally responsive care to employees. Share this list with your EAP and ask what type of advanced training providers have completed with regard to antiracist clinical practice? Encourage, and even financially support through increased reimbursement rates for services, when possible, this type of training for your EAPs and other providers within the workplace. 6. Establish a plan for ongoing feedback to sustain this important work. Create, or re-activate, an EAP advisory board within each workplace to meet with the EAP regularly and communicate about trends in the workplace, gaps in services needs, and overall response to EAP and related program. Informed and active EAP advisory boards can help EAPs stay abreast of changes that are coming, and board members can help to promote and minimize stigma about using EAPs and related services when they truly understand their potential value. Ensure that people on that board represent different departments, but also represent workplace demographics. Be sure these boards provide a safe and eventually a “brave space” where white people and BIPOC can speak up regarding challenges and injustices that won’t be denied or pushed aside. Design these spaces so that when the hashtags and protests of the current movement end, the work will continue, and EAPs and their client companies will be held accountable for meaningful change and reform. With protests against racism continuing around the world, well-positioned and well-supported EAPs that hold solid relationships with workplace leaders can be part of the solution. But EAPs and workplaces need to work in partnership to support these goals and visions for organizational change. This list is not exhaustive, but the recommendations serve as starting points on how EAPs can have an even greater role in supporting workplaces to be more antiracist.

For any business that relies on direct sales to drive revenue, that means systematically updating your sales organization. Companies should: 1) put Sales at the center of their strategy, 2) leverage Sales to discover and meet new customer needs, 3) improve the sales experience, and 4) not forget to leverage the physical environment while social distancing. Morning Brew/Unsplash Leer en español It has become clear that we won’t be back to “business as usual” anytime soon. A few months ago, the changes to the workplace brought on by Covid-19 were viewed as a temporary adjustment — something we needed to endure for a few months before the inevitable return to commuting, offices, and face-to-face meetings. But as companies settle into the reality that the current state of things might be the new normal, they need to shift their focus from temporary fixes to a fresh approach to your organizational strategy. For any business that relies on direct sales to drive revenue, it’s time to systematically update your sales organization for the world we’re living in now. Here are four keys to selling more effectively throughout the duration of the pandemic — and beyond. Put sales at the center of your strategy. What changes has your business experienced throughout the pandemic? Have you adapted the way your sales organization goes to market to meet different priorities? Most organizational strategy models either ignore the sales function entirely or only address it peripherally, focusing instead on markets, products and capabilities, initiatives, and so forth. This may have worked well enough in a good economy, but in a tight market, look to your sales function to win business. Sales connects all of your offerings to the market and the sales function is how strategy gets executed. Give sales the tools it needs to succeed by clearly identifying your ideal client profile, detailing the specific reasons clients will choose you over the competition, and getting clear about issues that will likely drive customer decisions. The pandemic has meant for most that there is less business to be won. Yet, this presents an opportunity to rethink not only what you are selling, but how you are selling it as a means to increased revenue, margin, or market share. Leverage Sales to discover and meet new customer needs. Even though the economy has tightened during the pandemic, it doesn’t mean there aren’t new opportunities. Covid-19 has caused lifestyle shifts that have created new markets and sales prospects. For example, across the United States, RV sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic, with sources showing increases of over 600% from previous years. And for most of these customers, buying an RV isn’t a one-off purchase — it represents a new lifestyle which brings even more product lines to the market. RV companies have leveraged these new customer needs by extending their product lines into areas such as camping gear and trendy RV and “van life” interior design options. What new customer needs can your organization address? This is an opportunity to learn about the issues that are driving or reducing the use of your products, determine what additional problems you could help customers solve, and build a strategy to capitalize on and adapt your offerings. Look to your sales organization as the feedback loop to glean insights about your customers’ changing needs. They are, after all, on the front lines and are uniquely positioned to help you understand what customers want now and aren’t getting or, perhaps most importantly, what they are getting from the competition. Applying those insights can be a game changer, not only for driving revenue, but for informing strategic growth decisions on new product and service combinations, the optimization of your manufacturing process, and much more as everyone adapts to long-term Covid-related realities Improve the sales experience. At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, many organizations adapted by moving sales interactions to videoconference or phone. But the longer-term opportunity is to rethink how to use these platforms to improve, not just sustain, the sales experience — creating value and providing differentiation with prospects and clients to make the whole experience more compelling. To do this, consider new opportunities to help customers recognize issues and identify opportunities they hadn’t considered. With video and phone, it’s easier than ever to involve “Subject Matter Experts,” implementation or customer support staff, and other functions earlier in the sales process to provide deeper expertise and greater insight. Videoconferencing also makes it easier to involve company leaders with customers to address problems and provide higher-level connections and executive sponsorship. In a Fortune 100 technology company I worked with, when there was executive-to-executive level engagement with a client, accounts produced 38% more revenue than those where no executive level relationships existed. Now is the time to rethink how your sales experience can deliver value for potential customers as a key element of your strategy in the Covid-19 world. Design a sales experience that helps customers gain insight about challenges and opportunities created by the virus. For instance, a consumer packaged-goods client of mine created an interactive customer forum aimed at revealing opportunities and trends their clients may be able to capitalize on. Other companies have produced videos for clients to help them think through the implications of the new problems they’re facing. I’ve also attended live Q&A webinars that give potential and existing customers the chance to interact with your company and learn from each other. The switch to remote work and virtual interactions may result in unexpected efficiencies — both in time and resources — that help you improve proactive customer outreach and create a whole new sales and customer experience. A fun example of this happened when my family ordered take-out for dinner from a local Italian restaurant during the height of the pandemic lockdown. Along with our dinner, we received a roll of toilet paper branded with the restaurant’s logo, which was an incredibly valuable and unexpected add-on at that time. When everyone was struggling to find toilet paper in the stores, this restaurant that had an excess of toilet paper because they could not serve dine-in guests, seized on an opportunity to create an exceptional customer service experience. Needless to say, we ordered several more meals from the restaurant in the following weeks! Don’t forget to leverage the physical environment while social distancing. Your sales organization will undoubtedly become more digitally savvy as an outcome of Covid-19, and we’ll continue to discover more tools that can help us connect virtually. But with some thought and a little advance planning, you can leverage the physical world to great effect during your virtual meetings. Any business that deals with tangible products can ship physical samples, models or prototypes to a client, and then follow up with a phone conversation. Even small gestures, such as sending a client a printed copy a document to save them from having to use their home printer, can be a way to connect in the physical world. Additionally, while you may not be able to meet up with clients in person, you can still recreate some of the physical environment you’re missing out on. Send a bag of gourmet coffee to a prospect and schedule a conversation over a cup of coffee (and they’ll have gourmet coffee for a week!). Or have a nice lunch delivered toward the end of your videoconference to recreate the enjoyment of getting together at a restaurant. I have a client who invited a group of prospects to a virtual wine tasting, sent three bottles to arrive the day before, and had a sommelier lead a 30-minute tasting by videoconference. It’s often about being thoughtful and reallocating a portion of your travel and expense dollars creatively. *** Facing the disruptions caused by Covid-19 continues to be a challenge, but it can provide unexpected opportunities to drive a better sales process with prospects and customers. With thoughtful modifications, planning and some imagination, your sales strategy, sales experience, and customer interactions can emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.

Argenti October 16, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Executive Summary Companies are increasingly under pressure to take a stand on high-profile political and social issues. Sometimes there is a clear moral issue at hand and the consequences will be most severe if you don’t say anything. At other times, it may not be so clear. But ultimately if your words don’t match your actions, they will be perceived as inauthentic, hypocritical, or woke-washing. Before deciding which issues to speak out on, companies and leaders should ask three questions: 1) Does the issue align with your corporate mission and values? 2) Can you meaningfully influence the issue? 3) Will your constituents (employees, customers, community) agree with speaking out? Anton Shunkov/Getty Images Leer en español Black Lives Matter. Trade policy. Immigration. Over the last four years, companies have been under pressure from their constituencies — employees, customers, investors, and the communities in which they operate — to take a public stand on high-profile political and social movements. According to research from the Edelman Trust Barometer, 54% of employees globally believe that CEOs should speak publicly on controversial political and social issues they care about. Similarly, 53% of consumers agree that every brand has a responsibility to get involved in at least one social issue that does not directly impact its business. It is impossible and impractical for companies and executives to speak out on every issue. With some, there will be an obvious moral reason to take a stand. At other times, it may not be so clear. Thus, the question for companies and C-level executives is when should you speak out? If you choose to do so, how should you prepare and position your response? Should your company take the lead in driving the conversation, or is it better to partner with other organizations to have a more meaningful influence on the issue? Or should you instead avoid speaking out at all? To help companies make this decision, I’ve created the following framework, based on my research and consulting experience over the last five years. Three Questions to Guide Your Approach To begin, your company should ask the following questions: Does the issue align with your company’s strategy? Your strategy is based in part on the company’s mission and values. If there is a misalignment with the issue you’re speaking out on, your statements will be viewed by your constituents — and the public — as inauthentic. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? Does your company have the expertise and resources to make a difference? And are you willing to put your money where your mouth is? If not, but you speak out anyway, you risk being seen as hypocritical or as “woke-washing.” Will your constituencies agree with speaking out? Obviously, your company greatly reduces its risk of disrupting future business if key constituencies generally agree with the proposed stance. When these constituencies disagree with each other, however, you must discuss and carefully weigh their relative importance to your business (e.g. a small customer segment with limited power vs. your largest investor). A Framework to Guide Your Response The answers to the above questions are certainly not easy to determine and will contain a lot of company-specific nuance. However, executive teams must try to get to a “Yes” or “No” on each one (even if it’s a “mostly yes” or “mostly no.”) If you answer yes to all three questions, then you have the opportunity to speak out as a leader on the issue at hand. Starbucks did this after a notorious 2018 incident in which a Philadelphia store manager called 911 after two Black men who were refused access to the bathroom refused to leave the store, resulting in their arrest. After protests and online outrage, Starbucks apologized and issued a new bathroom policy. It also shut down 8,000 stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training that was shaped by a number of experts, including the Equal Justice Initiative Founder and Executive Director Bryan Stevenson and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill. Starbucks also offered to share this training with other companies. Starbucks’ response checked “yes” to all three questions: Does the issue align with your company strategy? In its mission, Starbucks describes itself as “a third-place environment, where everyone is welcome, and we can gather, as a community, to share great coffee and deepen human connection.” All customers must feel comfortable in Starbucks stores and this racist act happened in a store – Starbucks had to speak out. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? By developing new anti-bias training, instructing 175,000 baristas, and sharing it with their peers, Starbucks had a meaningful opportunity to influence how people of color are treated in retail stores. By shutting down all stores for training, Starbucks demonstrated its commitment. Will your constituencies agree with speaking out? Starbucks key constituencies were aligned. Customers and community members were outraged by the incident. And as one employee put it: “It’s a horrible thing that happened to those two men … that we get to be part of a group of people wanting to do something systemically different is awesome.” Starbucks’ actions in the spring of 2018 were very different from three years earlier, when the company, in partnership with USA Today, launched its widely panned “Race Together” campaign in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. As part of that initiative, baristas were instructed to write “Race Together” on cups and engage customers in conversations about race. This initiative was generally perceived as a marketing stunt. If we apply the framework to this initiative: Does the issue align with company strategy? Discussing race in a forced and unmediated setting is not part of the company’s strategy or mission, and it largely made employees and customers feel uncomfortable. Can you meaningfully influence the issue? Starbucks could not have hoped to meaningfully influence the issue of racism in America through the “Race Together” campaign, in part because race isn’t an issue (racism is), and largely because the campaign didn’t have concrete aims/pledges to do anything beyond talking. Will your constituents agree with speaking out? While many Starbucks constituents are likely supportive of ending racism in America, they were not supportive of discussing race in Starbucks stores. As one post on Twitter stated: “Not sure what @Starbucks was thinking. I don’t have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train. #RaceTogether.” When your answer to each of the questions is no, I recommend not speaking out at all, but not every case is so clear cut. Many times, companies will find themselves with a mix of yes/no answers to the three questions. If your executive team answers “Yes” to two of the questions, but “No” to a third, then you should consider carefully your next steps before speaking out. You might want to approach the situation as a follower, letting others take the lead. This may include joining a coalition of companies or an industry association that has decided to speak out on the issue. Or perhaps you might have a division or individual product or brand that decides to speak on the issue, rather than the company as a whole. If your executive team answers “Yes” to only one of the questions, but “No” to the other two, then I suggest you do not speak out, but continue to monitor the situation – things might change that turn a “No” into a “Yes” with time and lead you to speak out. How Should You Prepare and Position Your Response? While news events may feel unexpected, the underlying issues — from racism to gun violence to sexism — are often long simmering. Companies can and should discuss in advance which issues they have a view on and create a playbook for their response. First, assign a forecasting team to monitor and research hot-button issues, homing in on the ones that are most likely to align with or impact your business strategy. The team should include representatives from your marketing, communications, strategy, and legal (usually compliance) departments as well as someone from the C-suite. It should research other organizations or individuals who have spoken out on a given topic and what the outcome has been. The team should also create a competitive map: Who are the most influential players speaking out on the issue? How does your influence compare to theirs? Finally, the team should prepare answers to the following questions: What is your company’s mission, vision, value set, and strategy? What are the social/political/environmental threats to these elements of strategy? Where and how can you meaningfully influence the discussion to neutralize these threats? What will your voice uniquely add to the discussion? Which issues do you have constituency alignment on? Second, create a playbook for speaking out on the issues identified above. Use a communication strategy framework to guide your thinking here: Who are your key constituencies? What do you want them to do/think/understand about the issue? What do they need to know? How can you measure success? Then develop a detailed game plan for when you need to mobilize quickly. Decide in advance who needs to be part of the decision-making process. Executives should be aware of the company’s stance on relevant issues and know where to access talking points. Review the playbook at least annually with your executive team and update as needed. Don’t be afraid to toss or overhaul playbooks that are no longer relevant. Companies need to understand that expectations of business are changing from society, consumers, employees, and investors. Even if they have not yet been confronted with a decision to speak out on a potentially controversial topic, they will likely find themselves needing to make this decision in the future. This framework offers a business case for how to respond. But companies also need to weigh the morality around a given response, the intensity of emotion associated with a specific constituency, and what the consequences of no response might mean. Using this methodical approach, companies will be able to determine which issues are most relevant to their business to maximize the effectiveness of their actions both to make a positive impact on society and their bottom line. In the end, however, the philosopher Plato may offer the best advice for companies looking beyond the business case for speaking out: “Wise men [sic] speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.” The author wishes to thank Sanne Verhoeven, Madelynn Conlin, and Katelin Hartford for their research contributions to this article.

For many companies, well-positioned Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that hold strong relationships with workplace leaders can be part of the solution. The author recommends six actions for EAP professionals, programs, and the workplaces they support. Martin Barraud/Getty Images Leer en español It may surprise some employers to know that when employees experience racism and/or other forms of discrimination and oppression, one of the places they can turn for help is their Employee Assistance Program or EAP. While EAPs are thought of more often for use by employees for short-term counseling and referrals to help employees manage personal problems so that they don’t interfere with work performance and productivity, it is important to remember that EAPs also provide workplaces with services including organizational assessment, management consultation and strategic crisis prevention and response. It is precisely because of this mix of individual and organizational level of services that EAPs are in a unique position to help employees work through the trauma of racism and to provide workplace leaders with an invaluable insider view of complex workplace problems, including racism. As a professor and chair of the only Masters in Social Work (MSW) program with a focus on preparing graduates for careers in the field of Employee Assistance, I have received numerous calls over the past several months from employers asking for advise and consultation regarding how they can work to challenge — and dismantle — their own systems that uphold racist views and policies. Additionally, I have heard from many EAP managers and counselors, also asking how their EAPs can play a more significant role in helping workplaces respond to systemic racism. On more than one occasion, EAP professionals have confided that they felt powerless after working one-on-one with an employee who is suffering effects of racism. Simply offering stress management support did not feel adequate, and they lacked a line of communication to management to report the need for systemic change. Similarly, EAP managers are receiving calls from managers and supervisors whose employees are requesting workplace meetings to discuss issues or race and racism. And workplace leaders are asking how their EAPs can play a bigger role in helping to influence system-level change to combat racism. In response, I’ve developed a list of six things employers need to do to build a more effective partnership with their EAPs that will not only support individual employees during this period of massive social change, but also support managers and supervisors and help to ensure meaningful and sustained long-term reform. 1. Encourage a data-driven approach to customized EAP services. A data-driven approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion within our EAPs and broader workplaces is critical if we are to make real impact in dismantling systemic racism. You need to know who is — and isn’t — using your EAP. You cannot identify service utilization gaps without data. Is your EAP collecting data on race, ethnicity, income, and gender identity? How are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who sought out EAP services being helped? What are the outcomes? Data can be reported to the workplace in the aggregate so that individual employee demographics and identities are protected and kept anonymous from employers. 2. Support an EAP counselor and affiliate network that is responsive to your workplace. Employers should encourage EAPs to conduct an audit of their staff and counselors — not just to see if they are accepting certain health insurance plans, but to see who is providing the services. EAPs often ask if clients have a preference for counselor gender and language, but is your EAP asking clients for a preference with regard to race and/or ethnicity? And if they did ask, could the EAP realistically meet their preference? Are EAP counselors trained to provide culturally responsive and culturally relevant services? In addition to auditing the EAP counselor/affiliate network, take a good look at the EAP marketing and promotional materials that are being shared with your employees. Are these materials inclusive and do they provide an accurate reflection of the racial demographics of your workplace, in addition to other characteristics? If not, work in partnership with your EAP to support revising materials, both in print and online, to better align with your employee demographics. 3. Encourage managers and other leaders to take advantage of the EAP for themselves. Many managers and supervisors are finding themselves eager to learn more about racism and implicit bias, but fearful to admit what they don’t know or to make a mistake. Assume that they would all benefit from education and consultation. EAPs can play a role by equipping leaders with resources so they can do their own learning and introspection, and feel more competent in their abilities to lead difficult conversations about race. Encourage managers and workplace leaders who have used EAP services in the past to share their story. Demonstrating leadership buy-in and commitment is one of the best ways to increase EAP utilization within a work organization. 4. Create a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion advisory committee that includes your EAP. A diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) advisory committee can help companies consider their public stance against racism and how it helps — or hurts — employees. The EAP should work in partnership with this committee to assess needs and help leaders create answers without placing unfair burden on BIPOC. Additionally, the EAP can provide de-identified examples of employees’ first-hand accounts of racism to help workplace leaders understand the deep impact of racism within a workplace and potential points throughout the work organization for support, intervention, and change. 5. Recognize racism as trauma. Racism is a form of trauma, and EAPs need to apply a trauma-informed approach to all of their work, actively working to resist re-traumatizing a person or community when providing support and providing culturally responsive counseling and support services to individuals who have been traumatized by racism. PsychHub created a list of resources that serve as a starting point to inform workplaces about how to provide more trauma-informed and culturally responsive care to employees. Share this list with your EAP and ask what type of advanced training providers have completed with regard to antiracist clinical practice? Encourage, and even financially support through increased reimbursement rates for services, when possible, this type of training for your EAPs and other providers within the workplace. 6. Establish a plan for ongoing feedback to sustain this important work. Create, or re-activate, an EAP advisory board within each workplace to meet with the EAP regularly and communicate about trends in the workplace, gaps in services needs, and overall response to EAP and related program. Informed and active EAP advisory boards can help EAPs stay abreast of changes that are coming, and board members can help to promote and minimize stigma about using EAPs and related services when they truly understand their potential value. Ensure that people on that board represent different departments, but also represent workplace demographics. Be sure these boards provide a safe and eventually a “brave space” where white people and BIPOC can speak up regarding challenges and injustices that won’t be denied or pushed aside. Design these spaces so that when the hashtags and protests of the current movement end, the work will continue, and EAPs and their client companies will be held accountable for meaningful change and reform. With protests against racism continuing around the world, well-positioned and well-supported EAPs that hold solid relationships with workplace leaders can be part of the solution. But EAPs and workplaces need to work in partnership to support these goals and visions for organizational change. This list is not exhaustive, but the recommendations serve as starting points on how EAPs can have an even greater role in supporting workplaces to be more antiracist.

That’s a Big Mistake. by Julian Runge October 28, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Print Executive Summary Business experimentation is—rightfully—framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, but the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. That’s a big mistake. E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent). In this study, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance. Maciej Toporowicz, NYC/Getty Images Leer en español Recently, I gave a talk to 30 senior digital growth managers on how to use business experimentation effectively. I started the session with a brief survey: Who had run experiments with their website and app — for example, testing different layouts, colors, designs, or onboarding experiences? Close to 90% of hands rose in response. Then I asked who had run experiments with their digital advertising, such as evaluating different audience targeting, frequency, or optimization regimes for their campaigns? Only about a third of those same hands went up. This result did not surprise me; rather, it confirmed what I had seen during a year-long investigation of firm behavior on Facebook’s advertising platform: While business experimentation is — rightfully — framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. Many firms are used to non-experimental approaches to advertising measurement, such as marketing mix models, and hesitate to adopt experimentation-based measurement in part because they overestimate its complexity. Most digital advertising platforms offer “experimentation-as-a-service” tools and, while some of the testing parameters are indeed more advanced than what has long been commonly available in advertising, a digital team can help sort through optimization strategies, frequency regimes, or audience targeting strategies. Many firms simply start off by testing their current digital approach against a control population called a “holdout group” which receives no messaging; this allows them to gauge how their existing ads work relative to no advertising. More sophisticated experimentation can then follow. To quantify companies’ use of experiments, my colleagues and I at Facebook Marketing Science Research conducted an observational survey of leading firms’ use of randomized control trials (RCTs) to gauge the impact of a given ad campaign on various business outcomes relative to a control. Though we suspected that only a minority of firms used the practice, we were surprised by just how few: Only 12.6% of the 6,777 companies we looked at had conducted a recent RCT (see our academic paper here). As you might expect, companies’ use of experimentation varies by industry. Factors such as the pace of consumer consideration and purchase cycles or (as will be discussed) the presence of organizational-culture barriers can influence adoption. At the top of the scale, somewhat more than 20% of e-commerce, telecommunications, and retail advertisers conducted experiments; however, only 6.7% of consumer package goods companies and 4.2% of automotive businesses did so. Firms that do experiment tend to run more than one experiment in a year, averaging 15 experiments per firm in e-commerce and close to 50 in the travel sector, and typically invest about 10% of their overall advertising budget in experimentally measured campaigns. This investment seems to pay off: E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent). In our sample, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance, highlighting the positive longer-term impact of this strategy. Is there an aversion to experimentation in advertising? Given the powerful impact of ad experiments, why are they so underused? Through conversations with internal and external domain experts and scholars, I’ve identified several common organizational obstacles that may account for this. Organizational inertia: The “Mad Men” days of advertising are (largely) over, but creativity continues to be an essential ingredient for lasting success in advertising. You may remember Donald Draper’s tantrums when he faced research that challenged his preconceptions. Because marketing creatives can be skeptical about data-analytic approaches, empiricism and data-driven decision making need to be carefully introduced to — and ultimately combined with — creative and intuitive advertising operations. This process takes time. Holdout aversion: Randomized controlled trials require a control group; as noted, in ad experimentation the control is often a holdout group that is not exposed to any advertising. This of course lowers the number of potential customers that the campaign will reach. This does not sit well with many marketers who may feel that the cost associated with excluding potential customer from a campaign outweighs the benefits of experimentation. But as noted, our study shows that advertisers who run experiments experience better performance than those who do not. While we cannot be certain that experimentation caused this outperformance, it is highly unlikely that using holdouts as a control is a net negative. Requirement of inter-company alignment: Managers are used to regularly changing, adapting, and evaluating the firm’s websites and apps, tapping inside talent. Experimentation with advertising, on the other hand, commonly requires collaboration between companies and the use of tools provided by other firms. Additionally, many firms may lack the required culture of collaboration between marketing and other functions needed to execute ad experimentation. Entrenched legacy decision support tools: Marketing mix models are well established and trusted decision-support tools that are seen as less technologically complex and costly than setting up RCTs. But in fact, launching RCTs on digital channels doesn’t require unusually complicated technology, can be done at near zero cost, and can actually help optimize existing marketing mix models. How should firms adopt advertising experimentation? My colleagues and I at Facebook worked with the Boston Consulting Group to understand how leading firms successfully integrate experimentation into advertising operations. While there is no “one size fits all” solution, we identified the following four organizational characteristics among high-performing firms. Executive endorsement: Successful experimentation initiatives need an executive sponsor who can align stakeholders and create the urgency required to change existing behavior and convictions. Advertising experiments can reveal new approaches that may require major marketing budget reallocations across channels. If, for example, an experiment identifies a strategy that would increase ROI five-fold but would require shifting millions of dollars in the budget against some executives’ will, an “intervention from the entire C-suite, with the CEO as the ultimate advocate,” may be needed “to break down broader business silos,” according to BCG’s recent report “Marketing Measurement Done Right.” Culture: Leadership needs to foster a culture where robust empirical evidence can overrule preconceptions and opinions. This culture needs to be set (and lived!) at the top. Installing cross-functional committees and “forced mingling” in cross-departmental workshops can catalyze the required culture shift. The BCG report describes the case of a large automaker: “Management initiated a program of cross-functional conversations involving business units and functional departments. These sessions used multiunit data first to define profitability and then to determine how it would be measured across the company and what success would look like for the manufacturer as a whole.” While such initiatives benefit the firm more widely, they help establish a crucial basis for companies to be able to leverage the insights generated in large-scale advertising experiments. Talent: The talent required to produce and understand complex data and experimental results needs to be acquired and trusted by senior stakeholders. A marketing data science team reporting to an executive function can take on this role. In the words of a digital leader in the telecommunications space quoted in the BCG report: “Our priority became hiring the best talent for our digital team…With the right people in place, we achieved 40% year-over-year sales growth with the same marketing spend.” Persistence: Experimentation is a continuous iterative process that is never completed and that shapes other internal processes. To reap its full benefits, firms need to view it not as a tactical task but a strategic pillar of decision making and ideation. Rallying the troops behind it may take a long time. As the vice president of marketing for an automotive OEM that BCG surveyed reports: “It takes a year of everyone questioning a new model until we have enough history to believe in it.” A heuristic approach to get advertising experimentation off the ground can be to hire a dedicated digital marketing team and earmark a portion of the advertising budget for experimentation; as noted, 10% is typical among companies with a successful experimentation program. Then, in collaboration with other company functions such as finance, marketing leadership can identify a key performance indicator that advertising is to drive. Examples are return on marketing investment or a composite of brand and direct response metrics. The marketing team can then develop new advertising approaches to influence the defined metric. The right culture can catalyze the team to rigorously adopt better-performing advertising approaches and abandon poorly performing ones — ultimately ensuring that existing and potential customers see better and more relevant ads.

Do they know if it’s okay to turn off their video during a Zoom meeting? Or to take a break from work and go for a walk in the middle of the day? During stressful times, it can be helpful to everyone, whether they’ve been at your company for years or just started last week, to know exactly what the unstated cultural and emotional norms are. So write them down and share them. The authors call these “it’s okay to…” lists and suggest including unspoken rules related to digital communication norms, emotional support, psychological safety, and work styles. This simple exercise can have a big impact on easing employee anxiety and helping every person on your team feel secure and supported. Kenny Williamson/Getty Images Leer en español Every workplace has unwritten rules. If you’re on a video call with 20 of your colleagues, is it okay to turn your camera off? When you email your boss, do you include a bunch of emojis? During stressful times (i.e. right now), it’s good practice to write down the unstated cultural and emotional norms that exist within your team or company. They might have changed since you all started working from home, or perhaps they’ve never been explicit to everyone. You might know that it’s okay to take a walk in the middle of the day to clear your head, but it might not be as obvious to your colleagues, especially if they’re new hires. These seemingly small uncertainties (“Can I step outside to take a short break?”) can become major stressors. Combating them is crucial to helping everyone on your team feel secure and supported, especially in the current climate. In our book No Hard Feelings, one of our most popular suggestions is to write an “It’s okay to…” list. We heard about the idea from the writer Giles Turnbull, who wanted to emphasize to new employees at the U.K. Government Digital Service that it was always okay to do things like ask for help, make mistakes, and have off days. He drafted a list, asked his colleagues to add other ideas, and then designed posters that he hung all over his office. His final list included things like “It’s okay to…”: Say you don’t understand Not know everything Have quiet days Ask why, and why not Ask the management to fix it Lists like these surface permissions that already exist within workplace cultures, but that not everyone is aware of or that people often need reminding of. Matt Reiter, director at World 50, a private community for C-suite executives, created a list with his team. “It was clear things had changed since my team started working from home but no one had acknowledged them,” he said. “There are things I know it’s okay to do, but that knowledge comes from my seniority and time at the company. If it’s okay for me to take a mental health day, it’s okay for you as well.” Even the simplest reminders can lead people to change their behavior. Researchers at Google sent new hires an email reminding them that top performers at the organization regularly “Ask questions, lots of questions!” and “Actively solicit feedback — don’t wait for it.” Just listing that out helped new hires practice and develop those skills, increasing their productivity by 2%, an increase of about $400 million per year. Given that many of us suddenly shifted to remote work earlier this year, we encourage teams to write Covid-specific “It’s okay to…” lists. You might include things like “It’s okay to…”: Turn off your video if you need a break during longer calls Shift your hours earlier or later to take care of family commitments Have a child or pet pop into the video screen Block off no-meeting time on your calendar for focused work We’ve also heard of a few organizations in the U.S. that are creating election-specific lists ahead of November 3 that include items like “It’s okay to…” form discussion support groups, take the day off to vote, or ask for help prioritizing work if you feel overwhelmed. Here are a few areas to consider when putting together a list for your team or organization: Digital communication norms Hopping on back-to-back video calls is draining. Be explicit about when people can turn off their cameras and when they should plan to have them on. For example, in small groups where you’re doing a lot of discussion or collaboration it may be important to have everyone visible. But at many workplaces, video calls have become the default, even for meetings when a phone call or no-video call would suffice. Or maybe your team agrees that everyone should turn on video for the first 10 minutes of a call to establish a connection, and then make it okay to turn it off for the remainder of the meeting. During the pandemic, business events organization PCMA created an “It’s okay to…” list to give their employees permission to dress comfortably and request a voice rather than video call. We also recommend thinking through whether it’s okay to… have kids pop up, answer the door if a package arrives, or get up during a longer meeting to stretch or get a drink. These can all alleviate anxiety and level the playing field among employees. Emotional support These are tough times. We’re not always going to perform at our best. Consider making it okay to have an off day, or to take a break in the afternoon. Beth Heltebridle, a branch librarian at the Frederick County Library in Maryland shared with us that she made a list with her Branch Leadership Team during their library closure due to Covid. Beth told us, “We shared our list out to build morale in these trying times, and have been sending it to new hires now that we are onboarding again. One of the hardest things is that our days look so different, and we miss interactions with other team members. Some of these ‘unsaid rules’ may be missed in our current situation, so we wanted to be sure to state them to new members and remind the rest of the team that our culture remains unchanged.” The library’s list includes items such as it’s okay to… not check your email at off hours, say yes when someone offers to grab you coffee, ask for patience, and make space to concentrate. Psychological safety New hires are the most likely employees to lack a sense of belonging and psychological safety. That’s why it’s especially important to emphasize to new hires that it’s okay to ask lots of questions and not feel like you know everything a week into starting your new job. Being remote makes it harder to get answers to small questions. And given the economic climate, many people feel lucky to even have a job or are terrified of losing theirs, which may make people feel especially hesitant to reach for fear of coming across as needy, slow, or annoying. But if people aren’t asking questions, they either aren’t doing their job as well as they could be, or they’re spending precious brainpower on worrying about how they are being perceived. These lists give permission for everyone to ask questions. You may even want to include specifics, like it’s okay to… ask questions, even if you think they are silly, or ask clarifying questions about questions you’ve already asked. Work styles We often work with people who have very different work styles — think extreme extroverts, cautious decision makers, and assertive debaters. And often the work styles that gets most normalized at an organization are those people in power or in the majority. For example, if most people are extroverts, especially leaders, an organization may default to large meetings and collaborative sessions. You could use an “it’s okay to…” list to make people with different work styles feel more comfortable, emphasizing that they don’t have to adapt to belong. For example, you could make it okay for introverts to rely on the chat function in a video call rather than unmuting themselves and speaking, or to ask for more time when making an important decision. Briley Noel Hutchison, a program manager at Girl Scouts — Diamonds of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, told us that her program team made it okay to be direct, have space for silence, and to follow up with people to help projects stay on track. As an added bonus, these lists can turn into recruiting tools. Giles Turnbull told us, “Several people said they’d applied for jobs at the Government Digital Service as a direct result of seeing the blog post about the posters, or of seeing images of them on social media. One photo of one poster became a powerful recruitment asset.” The act of making a list is a simple exercise that has positive benefits for new, tenured, and future employees — and allows you to reinforce your culture even when the nature of work changes.

Health Talking About Mental Health with Your Employees — Without Overstepping by Deborah Grayson Riegel November 03, 2020 Summary Full Text Save Share Print PDF 8.95 Buy Copies Executive Summary Like many managers, you probably checked in with your employees throughout last spring when the Covid-19 crisis first started. But you need to keep doing it. As the pandemic drags on, there is a rising number of people who are struggling with mental health issues. As a manager, you don’t want to overstep, but you can — and should — open up a conversation with your employees about how they are doing. The author has several suggestions for how to do that, including, talking about health holistically, avoiding making your employees feel like they are “broken,” and actively listening. Of course, it’s not your job to be your employees’ therapist, but it is your role to create an open, inclusive, and safe environment that allows them to bring their whole selves to work. Justin Paget/Getty Images Leer en español It’s been called a “second pandemic” — the mental health implications of the global health crisis, political unrest, economic uncertainty, rising unemployment, social isolation, remote work, home schooling, and so much more. And while it can feel like the first pandemic has been with us long enough for employees to have accessed the necessary resources and strategies for handling their stress, the fact is, many of us are struggling more, not less. You may have checked in with your employees back in April when the crisis was acute, but you need to keep doing it. Talking about mental health can feel tricky at best and terrifying at worst, however. And it becomes a vicious cycle — the less people talk about it at work (even when they know they and others are struggling), the more the stigma grows. To break this cycle, you have to address the issue proactively, strategically, and thoughtfully. After all, the way we talk to others who are dealing with anxiety (and to ourselves) has a major impact on how we feel. Managers have a responsibility to their employees to create an open, inclusive, and safe environment that allows them to bring their whole selves to work. In her article “We Need to Talk More About Mental Health at Work,” Morra Aarons-Mele shares research showing that “feeling authentic and open at work leads to better performance, engagement, employee retention, and overall wellbeing.” Leaders at all levels need to put mental health “on the table” — to talk about it, invite others to talk about it, and work actively to develop resources and plans for their employees. This is how to reduce mental health stigma while increasing the likelihood that your colleagues feel happier, more confident, and more productive. So how do you start talking about a topic that can make even the bravest leader worry about overstepping? Here are three ways: Talk about health holistically. Chances are that you’d ask your co-worker about the back pain they’ve been experiencing since they started working from home. You’d probably also ask your team member about the tendon they tore on a recent run. You might even share an update about your seasonal allergies or your indigestion. When you’re asking about someone’s health, make a note to ask about their mental health too. It can be as simple as, “It sounds like your back pain is getting better. That’s good news. And how’s your mental health these days? I know these can be very stressful times — and please let me know if I’m overstepping.” (And then stop talking.) It’s helpful if you are willing to share your own struggles, too, because it normalizes the discussion. You might try, “My allergies are keeping me up at night — and so is my anxiety. It’s really hard to get a solid night’s sleep when I’m worried about my kids’ safety at school. How about you? What’s keeping you up at night?” (And then again, stop talking.) It’s important to note that if you haven’t had a close connection with a particular employee in the past, your relationship may be low on psychological safety. To start building that up, take small steps. You might say something like, “I know that you and I haven’t typically talked about non-work topics, but for me, work and non-work feel like they’re blurring together these days. How are you doing with that?” Don’t try to fix people. Leaders often succeed by navigating difficult situations and solving complex problems. But people don’t like to be “fixed,” so don’t try. An employee who believes you see them as broken may worry that you don’t see them as capable or credible, which can undermine their confidence and competence. Approach your colleagues with the mindset that they are resourceful, able, and may need your support but not necessarily solutions. You want to be a bridge to resources, rather than being the resource yourself. If someone shares that they are struggling, try saying: “What would be most helpful to you right now?” “What can I take off your plate?” “How can I support you without overstepping?” “Let’s discuss the resources we have available here, and what else you might need.” “I’ve been through something similar. And while I don’t want to make this about me, I’m open to sharing my experience with you if and when it would be helpful.” Really listen. Financier Bernard Baruch said, “Most of the successful people I’ve known are the ones who do more listening than talking.” But it’s not enough to just listen; you need to do it well. But that’s not always easy — especially now when our own preoccupations, distractions, biases, and judgements get in the way. If you want to create an environment where your employees feel heard, respected, and cared for, here’s how: Be clear with yourself and your colleague that your intention for listening is to help. Suspend judgement (of yourself and the other person) by noticing when an “approving/disapproving” thought enters your mind. Let it pass or actively send it away. Focus on your colleague and their experience, being sure to separate their experience from yours. Listen for overall themes, such as social isolation or financial concerns, and don’t get mired in the details, which can distract you from the big picture of what’s going on with them. Since you’re there to support them, rather than solve their problems, you don’t need to know the specifics. Listen with your eyes as well as your ears. Notice changes in facial expressions, which can give you some cues to what the person is actually feeling — which may be different from what they’re saying. Recognize that when you start thinking to yourself, “What am I supposed to do?” you’ve stopped listening. Let your colleague know if something is interfering with your ability to really listen, whether it’s an urgent email, your child demanding your attention, or your own stress — and offer to reschedule your conversation for a time when you can really attend to them. As World Health Organization ambassador Liya Kebede said, “Helping others isn’t a chore, it is one of the greatest gifts there is.” Your willingness to open up an honest conversation about mental health with your employees is exactly the kind of gift that so many people want and need right now.

Alex Eben Meyer Work-life balance The Big Idea Series / Work, Parenting, and the Pandemic A Way Forward for Working Parents How to feel more confident, connected, and in control — during the pandemic and beyond. by Daisy Dowling by Daisy Dowling November 11, 2020 · Long read The Big Idea Series / Work, Parenting, and the Pandemic 01 A Way Forward for Working Parents 02 Your Questions About Work, Caregiving, and Covid-19, Answered 03 8 Ways to Build an Employee Resource Group for Parents 04 Dads, Commit to Your Family at Home and at Work 05 The Free Market Has Failed U.S. Working Parents 06 What Working Parents Need from Their Managers 07 From Hands-Off to Helicopters 08 How to Talk to Your Kids About Work During the Pandemic Summary. Working parenthood was hard enough before Covid-19 — and now it’s an all-out crisis. But as we exit the pandemic, we don’t want to return out of habit to the way things were. It’s time to reimagine how we combine children and career, moving from Working Parenthood 1.0 (hiding our struggles, buckling down, and feeling perennially bad, guilty, failing, lonely) to Working Parenthood 2.0, in which all working parents can feel more confident, connected, and in control. Each of us can begin making this shift on three levels: personal, team, and organizational. In this article you will learn small, feasible actions that can lead to 2.0 — that can make a huge difference for you today, and for every other working mother or father going forward. Tweet Post Share Save Print Bad. Guilty. Failing. Lonely. Do those words strike a chord? I’ll make a gentle guess that they do, because in my one-on-one coaching sessions with working parents over the past several years, I’ve heard those four words more than any others. And that was before Covid-19. Over the past eight months, managing work and kids has accelerated from a complex, persistent challenge into an all-out crisis. We’ve had to handle full-time jobs, full-time care, and full-time oversight of our kids’ education, without the benefit of our regular support systems. One of my clients returned to work from her first parental leave in March and has worked an around-the-clock schedule since, without any childcare. Like so many other parents, she wonders how long she can, as she puts it, “hang on.” Other parents I’ve coached and interviewed are trying to figure out how to manage frontline jobs and distance learning, or to hold on to their income while assuming 24/7 care for a child with special needs. I think it’s safe to say that in 2020 we’ve reached a working-parent low. I can’t wait for this pandemic to be over. I’m deeply grateful for what I have — health, family, work, shelter — and I’m acutely aware that others have it much tougher. Yet as I write this, with my laptop balanced on the corner of my kitchen counter, one eye on client emails and the other on my seven-year-old, who’s completing a math worksheet, I wish I could find a trapdoor that leads away from this situation, offering a magical escape. If you’re facing the terrible strain of combining a career and caregiving, I’m sure you feel the same. It’s natural to feel beaten down and nostalgic for pre-pandemic life (who isn’t reminiscing a little about 2019?), but we can’t let those feelings and desires lure us into short-term thinking. We’re working, and we’re parenting. We’re in this. And we have to find ways, however small, to make it less miserable — to take back some measure of control. We also need to start shaping what working parenthood will look like when the pandemic subsides, as far away as that may sound. This new normal has been stressful, unmanageable, and overwhelming — but we can’t go back to the old normal, because no matter how rosy it might seem right now, pre-2020 wasn’t good for working parents either. In this terrible situation, and with so much in flux, we need to take a new, distinct approach — one that can help fashion our own working-parent experiences. In this article I will describe what Working Parenthood 2.0 could look like and lay out several simple, feasible first steps toward it — steps that will also provide a bit of immediate relief. As counterintuitive as this may seem, I’m going to focus here on individual approaches and actions. Widespread, structural supports for working parents, such as parental leave and affordable day care, are absolutely essential, and we’re clearly lagging on those. But extricating ourselves — and helping extricate one another — from feeling bad, guilty, failing, lonely is essential to weathering the rest of the crisis and to pushing for the bigger changes that our families, our organizations, and our communities need. Before we dive into 2.0, let’s look at how we got into this mess in the first place. With that understanding, we’ll be ready to start getting ourselves out. The Bad, Guilty, Failing, Lonely Trap One of the most damaging misconceptions I hear from working parents — and I hear it every single day — is that they’re struggling while other parents are managing or thriving. Let me say this clearly: It’s not just you. The kinds of practical problems you face and the deep, disconcerting feelings you have about them are both common and completely normal. As one of the few people who have spent years in a unique ringside seat observing the current realities of working parenthood, I’m guessing that those realities are not what you’re measuring yourself against. Instead, when you think “working parent,” you may think of your parents or grandparents, and how despite working hard to earn a living, they sat down to dinner with you every night. Or of the more-senior leaders in your organization who somehow seem to make working parenthood work. Or even back to old TV shows you watched growing up, in which parents were apparently able to balance the personal and the professional without undue strain. Those impressions led you to believe that this is possible if I work hard enough or that good parents eat with their kids, or something similar. But your life is most likely very different, in many ways, from that firmly ingrained working-parent template. In those TV shows, maybe one parent worked and the other focused on the home front. Today that’s true for only 25% of American working families; the rest are dual-career or single-parent. Maybe in the past family members spent the bulk of their working years with a single employer; but statistically speaking, you’ll probably be in your current role for only four years — and you may be feeling pressure to network and manage your LinkedIn profile during what would otherwise be family time. Remember also: If your role models had kids prior to 2007, they didn’t have to work and parent amid the always-on expectations and 24/7 pressures created by the smartphone. In other words, being a working parent doesn’t just feel harder than your template tells you it should be. It actually is. As the pandemic has so clearly revealed, we carry an extraordinarily heavy load, yet even in extremis, we’re left on our own and left holding ourselves to unrealistic expectations. That imbalance is one of the main triggers of bad, guilty, failing, lonely feelings. It usually presents, and compounds, something like this: During what’s supposed to be family time, you get an important message from a colleague. When you turn away from your children to answer it — for the umpteenth time this week — you feel both under pressure and at fault: I have to respond, but here I go again, ignoring the kids. The challenge also comes in the other direction: You’re pulled away from work to look after a sick child or to supervise homework, for example. As the challenges pile up, your values — your identity — start taking a hit: Why can’t I figure this out? I’ve always been a hard worker. I should be able to handle this. Other people can. (Reminder: They can’t.) As you find yourself unable to “solve” the situation, the tension and self-criticism ratchet up further: What kind of mother/father am I, making these kinds of career choices and giving my kids short shrift? The kids need me, but my colleagues are watching; I’ll never get promoted, delivering like this. Now, roiled by negative emotions, you start to draw big-picture comparisons: My parents sat down for dinner with us every night; why can’t I manage? I used to be focused at work and a more present parent, and in this pandemic I’m neither. It all started with a single email, but now — wham! — here you are, feeling ground down, fed up, conflicted, and alone. And if you’re part of a group that isn’t always actively included in the working-parent dialogue — if you’re a dad, LGBTQIA+, or the parent of older children, for example — the feeling of isolation can be even more acute. That’s a crummy place to be, and when we’re this distracted and depleted, it becomes extremely difficult to be the very best parents we can be or to deliver a great performance at work. And if all 50+ million of us U.S. working moms and dads (or similar ranks in another country) stay collectively pinned down under bad, guilty, failing, lonely or suffering from an acute case of Why can’t I make this work?, how powerfully or effectively can we support one another or advocate for those much-needed policies and programs? I want to be crystal clear here: I’m not suggesting that we’re somehow to blame for the current working-parent state of affairs, and I’m not letting corporations, government, or other institutions off the hook. But I do believe that as individuals and as working-parent peers, we can contribute to the solution by shifting our own approach. Back in Working Parenthood 1.0 we buckled down and pushed ourselves to make things work, no matter what the cost. Let’s stop doing that. Instead, let’s become more realistic and authentic in our dual roles, and at the same time better stewards and advocates for ourselves and one another. What Working Parenthood 2.0 Looks Like Below are glimpses of how 2.0 could work and how, through a few specific and powerful first moves, we can begin to make combining career and family more straightforward, feasible, and satisfying. I think of 2.0 as having four essential elements: (1) a frank and no-apologies view of yourself as a single, whole, and complete person — even while performing two distinct and important roles; (2) more open, frequent, and satisfying connections with other working parents (and with colleagues who don’t have children); (3) a broadening of the working-parent “we” — more connections with working parents of various kinds; and (4) perhaps most crucial, a bias toward visibility and action. These elements are only a start but also eternal. They can help us get through the remainder of the Covid-19 era. They’re also crucial to making working parenthood work, for all of us and over the long haul. As you read, a few may strike you as more achievable or less, and all four together may feel overwhelming. My advice: Focus on what’s achievable now. That might be one action or a few. Whatever the case, think about how you might take them forward — for yourself, for your bosses and colleagues, and for your organization. For yourself. To short-circuit bad, guilty, failing, lonely, you need to ramp up your own sense of confidence and control. There are certainly many ways to do that, and if you’ve already found that exercise, a spiritual practice, mentoring, or any other habit or community helps keep you energized and in charge, then by all means stick with it. Like most of my coachees, however, you’ll probably benefit from two additional, deliberate approaches. Create distinct boundaries between work and family. For years we’ve trained our sights on work-life integration, the well-intentioned idea that you should bring together the two spheres of your life in a more seamless way — say, by attending a child’s sports tournament while keeping a watchful eye on the messages rolling in from work. Unfortunately, and particularly now during the pandemic, the seams have all but disappeared. It feels as if there’s no division between work and parenting: We spend the majority of our time in hypervigilant split-screen mode, scrambling to simultaneously parent and deliver the professional goods, all while wearing ourselves down and feeling less than effective at both — and that hurts. It’s time to (re)draw our boundaries. In the coming days, pick a line between career and kids, and do your best to stick to it. That line can be real or virtual. If you’re working remotely, maybe you check messages only at your desk, think of yourself as professionally “on” only while wearing shoes that aren’t sneakers, or decide to disengage from work at a certain time each evening. If you’re working a long day or night onsite, think about using the trip home to clear the mental space to be fully present for your kids. Create a tangible reminder if you can: One of my clients touches a small piece of artwork as if it were a light switch when moving from work into parenting or personal mode. You may have to make many such transitions every day, but each time you do, try to allow yourself to be fully there, whether in a meeting, on a call, or eating dinner with the kids. If that sounds aspirational, break it down: Try a small step, such as putting your phone away for 20 minutes each evening, and then gradually erect additional borders over time. You’ll still have too much to do, but building those dividing lines should come as a relief. Separate things out, and you’ll feel more attentive, competent, and you in each sphere. Re-stake. You’ve probably been advised to “ditch the working-parent guilt.” But that’s impossible. Guilt is the natural emotional by-product of acting, even in a small-scale way, in opposition to your genuine, closely held values. If you believe My kids come first but skip the bedtime routine to make (yet another) work deadline, you’ll feel strain and self-recrimination. You can’t “ditch” that feeling, because doing so would involve either renouncing your children as the center of your life or somehow becoming impervious to your own emotions, like a sociopath. Try a small step, such as putting your phone away for 20 minutes each evening, and then gradually erect additional borders over time. What will help take the temperature down, and what you can do, is re-stake: Firmly plant your values flag, even in rocky situations. Let’s say you missed bedtime because you had to jump on yet another call or work overtime, and your kids got really upset. As the guilt surges, tell yourself: My kids come first, and I make it my priority to be there for them. Because of events at work — the work I do to support our family — I had to miss bedtime tonight. That doesn’t change my commitment or who I am. I am a devoted mother/father, and my kids come first. In re-staking, you acknowledge the conflict and the full reality of what just happened, but you stay in charge of the emotional territory. Of course, if you find yourself constantly working overtime and re-staking around it, you’ll want to pull back. That’s an honest reorientation, not defensiveness. If you find it hard to re-stake in the moment, forecast a little. Look over your calendar for the coming week and spot where you may naturally feel a little guilty or conflicted — by that deadline on Wednesday, for example. When the time comes, and the negative feelings appear, you’ll be in a better position to declaw them. With your bosses and colleagues. If this pandemic has had one positive outcome, it’s a greater (if coerced) openness about what combining career and caregiving really looks like. Pre-pandemic, you may have deliberately limited the amount of “parenting stuff” you took to work and felt sheepish about your kids’ interrupting calls. Now that’s no longer feasible, so most of us have become more direct, forthcoming, and unabashed with our coworkers and bosses about parenting needs. As a result, we’re beginning to realize that we’re not alone in our challenges and struggles. Now we can take the next few steps toward being visible and in this together. Bring working-parent issues up in a career-related, rather than a task-related, context. So your boss has seen your four-year-old running around the house during a video call. That’s one thing. But how will you raise the “working-parent issue” in your next career conversation or performance review or feedback meeting — or job interview? In the past you probably wouldn’t have. Those moments would have been completely professional. You can certainly continue that way — but why keep on with the “parenting is unmentionable unless a baby is crying in the background” game? Maybe in year-end conversations, when discussing your accomplishments, you could slide something in and even get a little credit: In 2020 I worked as many hours as last year, and did so while managing significant personal challenges as the parent of two children. You’re not complaining or bragging; you’re still businesslike, while acknowledging the reality of what you did. Maybe that feels awkward — but so did the first time your toddler wandered onscreen during a Zoom meeting. If you’re worried about your job, or you’re in a sector or a chain of command where pushing the envelope simply feels like a nonstarter, think about a less career-risky way to fold the topic into bigger-picture professional conversations. Have a closed-door conversation with a mentor about your longer-term plans for flexibility. Or ask a slightly more senior colleague for advice about managing a career and kids; even the crustiest coworker softens up when approached for personal advice. The point is to help normalize a topic that may have been considered taboo. Be inclusive. A common habit I’ve seen in even working-parent-friendly workplaces is focusing all the effort and attention on what I call “visible” working parents — those who have asked for some kind of flexibility, are just back from leave, or have young children. That makes sense: It’s natural to focus on the parents we think need help the most. The tricky bit is that working parents come in all packages — male, female, gay, straight, biologic, adoptive, with older kids rather than babies — and most are feeling the pinch even if they don’t talk about it. There are also the colleagues who aren’t yet parents but already have their eye on how, longer term, it will be possible to make career and family work. So think about how to bring them in. If your organization has a working-parents’ network, ensure that invitations are broadly distributed and explicitly welcome “all parents, current and future” (for example). If you’re interviewing a prospective hire, mention your own kids and make it clear that you’re happy to talk about what life at your organization is like for caregivers. If you’re looking for working-parent mentors, or want to become one, deliberately seek out conversations with parents who have profiles and roles different from yours. If you’re a new mom, try asking a dad, or a parent with teenage kids, for advice. Effectively, you’ll be taking that old adage about having a “personal board of directors” and going for it, working-parent style. One of my coachees, a female attorney, was surprised when a male partner-level colleague gave her “the best” advice on making the transition from one child to two. Regardless of the difference bridged, a new perspective can be quite useful; and just as important, you’ve created a bond. For both your own benefit and that of other parents, widen the circle: Find ways in which to underscore that we’re all in this together. At the organizational level. As an individual parent in any organization — particularly a large one or one where there’s been little dialogue about working-parent issues — it’s easy to feel powerless. Nevertheless, you can help your company or institution improve its support of parents in a few important ways. Encourage benefits bundling and transparency. Most organizations are adept at designing and structuring benefits relevant to working parents — but less effective at communicating them in a user-oriented way and in destigmatizing their use. Even if a flex-work policy and backup day care are available, chances are that your manager doesn’t know the details, you’ll have to ask multiple people to get the information you need, and the enrollment forms live hidden in various corners of your company’s intranet. I routinely ask coachees what family benefits they’ve used or have available to them, and 95% of the time the answer is “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure how to sign up” or “That’s just for people who are really in trouble.” Transparency has improved during the pandemic, but it’s helpful to clear things up even further. Otherwise, too many moms and dads may go without the practical support and reassurance they could access or spend too much time and energy getting it. You may not work in the benefits department or in corporate communications, but you can — very constructively and tactfully — try to enlist their support. Send an email to your HR rep suggesting that a single “working-parent resources” splash page, with click-throughs, forms, explanations, and contact numbers for all relevant benefits, would be useful and appreciated. Several organizations I work with have sent companywide messages from senior leaders summarizing what’s available. Such pull-it-together communications save tons of organizational time (including the HR person’s). In a more active, grassroots way, offer to talk with newer parents in your department about your experience using the backup day care center, or let HR know that you’re open to speaking at an info session. Learning what to pack in the diaper bag before drop-off or how well managed you found the center will provide a nervous new parent much-needed direction and reassurance. If you’re in a small or an entrepreneurial organization, try politely flagging lower-cost, useful resources that your employer might consider offering. Maybe your startup can’t provide subsidized, center-based backup childcare but could cover employees’ annual subscription to a local on-demand sitter service. As you provide practical help to other working parents and help normalize their concerns, you’ll feel more personally empowered too. Contribute to — or start — a working-parents network group. Employee groups (often referred to as affinity networks, resource groups, or ERGs) for working parents are quickly becoming commonplace in large and midsize organizations. If yours didn’t have one, or plans for one, in January 2020, chances are good that it does now. At its best, such a group can be an easy, free way to connect with other parents whose professional experience is similar to yours; to get advice, tips, and encouragement; and to stave off the sense of I’m in this alone. That said, many groups lack a distinct focus or a sense of how to provide members with the most immediate value. You can play a powerful part here. If your organization doesn’t yet have a group, consider spearheading one. Invite the other parents you know — and the other parents they know — throughout the organization to meet at a specific time and share tips and tricks for a common working-parent challenge such as time management or finding new care arrangements. If you keep the invites inclusive and the conversation practical, the group will probably gain traction. If a group already exists, consider offering to host a targeted, solutions-oriented session. Book a time and invite network members to join you to discuss the most useful smartphone apps for working parents, for example. Or if you’re an accountant, offer to explain those child-related tax credits. (Let’s face it: Few of us really understand them.) Or invite a “friend of the company” with a career in education to discuss some aspect of the remote-learning challenge. You could help set up a Slack channel for adoptive parents; create a small subgroup of volunteers willing to take “phone a friend” calls from colleagues just back from leave; or set up an informal peer-to-peer mentoring program for parents thinking about career advancement and transitions. As you provide practical help to other working parents and help normalize their concerns, you’ll feel more personally empowered too. If you or your network group’s leaders are looking for more advice about group composition, leadership, and activities, you can find it here. . . . If all this feels hard to take in or seems like a lot to ask of yourself right now, I’m right there with you. Any one of these changes feels big; together, they’re daunting. As I sit hunched over my improvised work-from-home desk eight months into this pandemic, it’s hard to imagine wearing regular business clothes — much less feeling vigorous and on my front foot testing out new moves as either a professional or a parent. Even as someone who coaches other working parents for a living, I find the introspection, reframing, modeling, and advocacy required to make the changes I’ve described here alternately bold and doable or risky and overwhelming. What if I draw firm professional boundaries and get judged for it, or my business suffers? What if I connect with other smart working parents but we fail to come up with good collective solutions? What if we all do our best and nothing changes? Then, from the next room, I get the encouragement I need to at least try this, to make a start. Because we’re still mid-pandemic, and my kids are distance learning, my seven-year old is dialed into math class via my creaky old iPad. The teacher is explaining number bonds: how to stack different components and add smaller bits together and use different routes to reach an intended answer. Thirty years from now, I don’t want my daughter trapped in bad, guilty, failing, lonely, and you don’t want your kids to feel that way either. We want them to achieve their very fullest potential, as professionals, parents, and people. And we’re going to have to start using new components and taking different routes today to help them — and us — get there.

Leadership & Managing people How to Actually Encourage Employee Accountability It’s about dignity, fairness, and restoration — not blame. by Ron Carucci by Ron Carucci November 23, 2020 Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. Companies have been struggling to define and improve accountability processes —from annual performance appraisals to routine check-ins with the boss — for decades, and most employees still dread the conversations. Most of these processes usually result in forced categorizations in the form of numbers or labels, which can make employees feel threatened, demeaned, and insignificant. Even leaders who are beholden to flawed formal accountability processes can ensure that their employees feel their work is honored while simultaneously embracing opportunities to improve. In order to do so, dignity, fairness, and restoration must form the backbone of ongoing performance-related conversations. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español Fewer words in corporate vernacular induce a tighter wince than “accountability,” and for good reason. Companies and leaders have grappled with what it is and how to achieve it effectively for decades. Ask anyone if they look forward to their performance evaluation or periodic check-in with their boss, and most will give an emphatic “no.” Data shows that 82% of managers acknowledge they have “limited to no” ability to hold others accountable successfully, and 91% of employees would say that “effectively holding others accountable” is one of their company’s top leadership-development needs. Research also confirms how insignificant today’s accountability systems make employees feel. Gallup found that only 14% of employees feel their performance is managed in a way that motives them, 26% get feedback less than once per year, 21% feel their performance metrics are within their control, and 40% feel as if their manager holds them accountable for goals they set. Add to that the fact that 70% of employees feel their managers aren’t objective in how they evaluate their performance, and it comes as no surprise that 69% of employees don’t feel they’re living up to their potential at work. The fundamental problem with accountability is that it now involves little more than the process of accounting. The scorekeeping nature of this process yields a built-in negativity bias, where leaders reflexively hunt for shortfalls, and the tallying usually ends with a forced categorization — a rating system of numbers or labels, sometimes stack-ranking employees against their peers. I recently spoke with a leader at a client organization just after his performance review, and he was infuriated. “How could he rate me a 3? I’ve always been a 4. My whole career, I’ve been rated at the top! Now, suddenly I’m a 3, just because he’s only allowed to give out a certain number of 4s?” Listen to the painful conclusions this leader is drawing about himself and his boss. What should have been a productive conversation left him obsessed with a number and resentful of the person who consigned him to it. And he’s not alone. A recent neuroscientific study revealed that we respond to being categorically rated with a sense of being threatened — we literally feel unsafe when someone puts us in a box in this way. Accountability processes are the formal and informal ways that leaders talk about, assess, and affirm the contributions of those they lead and the improvements they can make to strengthen those contributions. They include everything from annual performance appraisals to routine check-ins with your boss. Even in the face of deeply flawed formal processes, leaders can ensure that their employees feel their work is honored while simultaneously embracing opportunities to improve. To make that experience commonplace, mere tweaks to the tallying processes of accountability won’t move the needle. Companies must dramatically redefine what it means for leaders to create a culture of accountability. Based on my 30 years of observing leaders who do this well and through my research on accountability, I’ve identified three major shifts leaders need to make to ensure that the accountability experience dignifies employees’ work and challenges them to make greater achievements — without making them feel demeaned or insignificant. Make Dignity the Foundation Managers must understand the weight of their own judgments. A recent study of the brain shows how other people’s opinions of us influence our sense of self-efficacy. When leaders believe their role is to create conditions in which people make their best contributions — and genuinely enjoy doing so — the following core foundations of accountability improve: Connections between leaders and direct reports deepen. Instead of obligatory monthly or quarterly check-ins during which employees provide rote updates, conversations should be undergirded by a sense of purpose. Questions like, “What did you learn this month?” or “What do you feel most proud of?” stir employees’ eagerness to tell their stories of achievement and struggle. The quality of feedback and learning increases. When dignity, not surveillance, is the goal of accountability, the quality of evaluative feedback improves. When employees believe their bosses are genuinely interested in their success, they feel less guarded and less inclined to hide their underperformance. When bosses are committed to their employees’ success and are less focused on documentation, they feel comfortable offering feedback and coaching about underperformance. One of the simplest ways to dignify those you lead is to ask for the story of their work. Instead of offering a perfunctory “good job” after somebody has finished a project, ask for details (“I’m sure it took more to get here than I can see. Can you talk to me about how you did it?”). As they tell their story, watch how animated they become as they tell you where they struggled and what they felt proud of. Focus on Fairness As I’ve written about before, when accountability systems are seen as fair, people are four times more likely to be honest (especially about their mistakes), act fairly toward others, and serve the organization’s purpose instead of their own interests. Our accountability systems have painfully confused sameness with fairness and have been designed largely to avoid litigation and reduce a manager’s biases. In practice, they’ve done more to stunt individuality, and that’s exactly what makes them unfair. Prioritizing fairness in our accountability processes allows two very important things to change. First, it reestablishes the connection between contribution and contributor. For decades, in an attempt at creating fairness, conventional thinking has kept the evaluation of work separate from the evaluation of people. This made sense when people were producing large volumes of the same output. But in a knowledge economy, people’s ideas, creativity, and analysis are direct reflections of who they are — the nature of today’s work makes accountability personal. It becomes fair when managers acknowledge contributions as the fruit of the unique talents of their employees. Efforts to force contribution and contributor apart are experienced as invalidating and unfair. Second, focusing on fairness exposes biases within accountability systems. Plenty of research shows that organizations privilege certain groups via implicit biases within their accountability systems. Viewing these systems through the lens of fairness prompts honest questions about how to change them. Who has access to prized opportunities? What are the existing expectations about who will or won’t excel? Whose voices and ideas get included? Questions like these reveal whether there’s equitable opportunity to succeed, regardless of one’s level of ability, and enable leaders to open up opportunities for people to shine with whatever talents they have. For example, a leader might broaden who gets to speak and present at meetings, or take a new approach to acknowledging traditionally privileged roles (like engineers at tech companies or marketers at branding companies) that levels the playing field for other types of contributions. I spoke with Hubert Joly, a former CEO of Best Buy, whose acclaimed turnaround of the retailer is well known. Key to that transformation was a new focus on helping individuals be themselves, to “be human.” As Joly told me: When I first started as CEO, and they showed me the forms to fill out about my team’s performance, and they wanted me to put numbers in boxes, I thought, Why would anyone do this? I decided to simply ask people, “How do you feel things went?” — and they would often be harder on themselves than I would have. I would ask, “What do you need from me?” — and they would tell me. It seemed like a much more human approach to holding people accountable. Joly applied that message to the organization as a whole.“What does it look like when we are at our best?,” store associates were asked during the process of setting standards for the company’s new brand. Allowing employees to help define the standards to which they will be held, Joly recognized, leads to better systems of accountability. When people help set the bar, they are far more motivated to reach it, and often exceed it. To demonstrate your commitment to fairness, ask those on your team — preferably anonymously — if they feel the playing field in your group is level, if they see some roles or people as privileged, or if they view you as you having “favorites.” Even if your intentions are good, people may still feel like they don’t have an equitable chance for success. Make Restoration, Not Blame, the Goal People dread accountability in their organizations. Why? Because when consequences are levied, they often feel shaming and harsh, despite corporate rhetoric about learning from failures. The reflexive response is to hide mistakes or point fingers elsewhere. If leaders believed that falling short of a goal still had merit, it could radically alter how people treat their own — and others’ — mistakes. As Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s Chief People Officer, told me: In a culture where people struggle to admit they don’t know something, calculating risk can be tricky. Being open about failure helps us balance a growth mindset with accountability. We are learning to not just reward success, but also reward people who fell short while getting us closer. We want it to be acceptable to say, “I don’t know, but I will find out.” Learning from our mistakes gets us closer to our desired results — that’s a new form of accountability for us. To treat mistakes restoratively, leaders need humility, grace, and patience. They must see any person’s arc of professional success as more than the sum total of any single assignment. Leaders also need the humility to acknowledge their contribution to people’s failures. Did the person have the resources, skills, team support, and realistic timelines to be successful? We have a long way to go before accountability within organizations becomes a welcomed process that yields fair, actionable feedback and encourages employees to embrace the opportunity to improve their performance and expand their contributions. Making dignity, fairness, and restoration foundational components of accountability systems is a powerful place to start.

Managing people Managing an Underperformer Who Thinks They’re Doing Great Five ways to close the gap — without crushing their spirit. by Liz Kislik by Liz Kislik December 02, 2020 Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. An underperformer on your team may not realize they have an inflated view of their own less-than-stellar performance. Clearer feedback or stronger supervision may help them thrive, but it’s also possible that they’re not able to recognize that they’re struggling. In any case, managers who fail to address these unaware underperformers risk losing what could be valuable team members or worse, demotivating the rest of their team. Determining the cause of their lack of awareness will either help you figure out what support they need in order to improve, or it will confirm your assessment that they just might not be able to satisfy the requirements of the job. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español Almost every leader has been in the uncomfortable position of managing someone who thinks their performance is terrific when it’s actually just adequate, or worse. In fact, in my 30 years of consulting, it’s been one of the more frequent — and draining — performance problems I’ve observed. What causes the mismatch between these employees’ real output and their perceptions of success? Some may not be receiving the resources and clear feedback they need to develop and improve; others may be unable to recognize that they’re struggling. Whatever the cause, if leaders fail to address the situation, the lagging employee’s work will not improve, and the organization will lose the value of a team member who could thrive if given the proper support. Perhaps a more insidious risk is that the leader will appear to condone substandard work, and competent employees may become demotivated and disengage. But if you can identify the likely cause of an underperformer’s lack of self-awareness, these five approaches will help you correct the problem behaviors — or understand whether that’s even possible. Be clear about expectations. A nonprofit client had a congenial work environment and a cultural commitment to understanding each other’s needs. The board chair was exasperated by the lack of results from a particular VP, who believed she was doing fine because she was making an effort. The board chair reminded the VP’s manager, a senior executive, that he was responsible for ensuring results. The manager reinforced performance objectives with the VP, but because he didn’t want to blame her or hurt her feelings, didn’t explain the harm to the organization or the fact that her job was in jeopardy. He continued to lose confidence in the VP and eventually reduced her duties as an indirect way of acknowledging her lack of progress. Both the board chair and the manager later acknowledged that no one had been direct enough with her about her performance problems. Provide employees with resources and support. Most employees need leadership, mentoring, and strong supervision in order to develop, particularly if they’re stepping into a function that’s new to the company or are promoted to fill an absence in the organization. If their natural skills are insufficient to meet the requirements of their role and responsibilities, they may not even perceive what their deficits are. A client company promoted a director to cover the gap left by the sudden departure of an executive two levels up. No one in the senior leadership evaluated the new director’s development needs, despite the fact that he was suddenly responsible for large numbers of people performing varied jobs. The new director assumed he was doing well by virtue of the promotion. But because this more complex job couldn’t be managed like his old one, the director became a burned-out micromanager, creating operating bottlenecks and severe employee dissatisfaction. Determine whether you’re willing to continue investing in the individual. If you’re not, it’s much more practical to reduce your expectations. In response to increasing frustration with a VP who consistently talked a great game but whose results over several years were always just shy of their target, a CEO eventually reassigned some of the riskier and sexier aspects of the VP’s job to another executive. The VP was offended, but stayed — and became more successful with the reduced scope of responsibilities. Assess whether they’ll accept help. It’s emotionally draining to keep faking success or status that’s not legitimate. In contrast to the people who experience imposter syndrome, many others fall victim to the Dunning-Krueger effect, a cognitive bias that prevents people from recognizing how badly they’re performing and that they need help. A mid-level administrator at a client organization bridled at the suggestion that his skills needed to improve and ignored the coaching that was offered to him. He found fault with everyone who questioned him and began setting up his colleagues, undercutting them, and misrepresenting their contributions and concerns. When these actions came to light, the business was forced to let him go. Target praise carefully. When an employee with an inflated sense of their own performance delivers high-quality work or conducts an interaction well, it’s important to praise them. But letting the praise stand alone can encourage them to think that everything they do is outstanding. Connect your positive comments to other things you want them to address. For example, you could say, “Now that you’ve done so well with the ABC presentation, for the next one, I’d like you to also [do the next thing they need to improve]. It’s important because…” Make sure you’re clear about both the necessary new behavior and why it’s required as part of satisfactory job performance. They may still think too highly of themselves, but doing this gives you a better chance of getting the crucial behaviors you need. Helping an unaware underperformer be more realistic about their work requires a lot of attention and involvement. Understanding what’s driving their lack of awareness will either help you determine what support they need in order to improve, or confirm your assessment that they just might not be able to satisfy the requirements of the job.

Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español As we come to the end of three and half years of often tortuous negotiations over, first, the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU and, second, the future relationship, we’re still none the wiser as to whether we can get a deal over the line by December 31 . On some days we see positive signals from both camps, with a potential deal imminent, but on others there appear to be near-insurmountable obstacles — in particular, the extent to which companies can receive government financial support and the access EU coastal countries and their fishing industries will have to UK waters. The latest news is that the EU is under pressure from the French government to tighten up the state aid requirements for the UK. What is clear, however, is that the whole process has been a mixed bag, if it’s analyzed using the principles of negotiations we teach in our executive programs at Oxford. While we aren’t privy to what’s going on behind closed doors, it’s still possible to make some general observations as to where certain negotiation techniques have been used well and others have not. Here are six highlights and lowlights of the negotiations and what they mean now, as the negotiations reach their conclusion. Principle #1: Build strong relationships ahead of time. During negotiations, understand what your counterpart cares about. Flash back four years ago, and you’ll remember David Cameron shuttling between European capitals trying to renegotiate the terms for Britain’s continued EU membership, which he would take to the British public in a referendum. While Cameron still backs what he achieved, it was clear to many that it wasn’t enough, particularly on the issue of free movement. Where did it go wrong? First, the UK government should have formed durable alliances in Europe much earlier; this kind of advance relationship building is one key to successful negotiations. The last-minute shuttle diplomacy proved to be too little, too late. Second, the EU failed to put itself in the UK’s shoes (another negotiation principle). Had they been even somewhat flexible over freedom of movement, they might have been able to keep one of Europe’s largest and most important countries within the EU family. Principle #2: Pay close attention to process. In negotiations, it’s nearly impossible to overestimate the importance of controlling the process. The EU did just that in the first stage of the negotiation, the UK’s negotiated withdrawal from the EU. By insisting that the issues important to the EU — the Northern Irish backstop, the rights of EU and UK citizens, and the UK’s financial liabilities — be agreed upon before discussions about the future relationship were even entertained, they gained an important victory in phase one. As a result of that early EU success, the UK has had less leverage in phase two (negotiating the future relationship). At this late stage in the negotiations, the UK could really do with having an issue like future financial commitments to use as leverage. Principle #3: Remember the stakeholders who aren’t at the table. In negotiations, communicating with those who aren’t at the table is every bit as important as communicating with those who are. There is a vast array of parties who have a stake in these negotiations: individual European countries, parliamentarians on both the UK and EU sides, industry groups, and the general public on both sides of the channel. Again the picture here is mixed. EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier has been diligent about providing updates on the status of the negotiations to member countries, European ambassadors, and the European Parliament. The same can’t be said in the UK, where industry groups have been kept in the dark. Many will remember two years ago when, in response to business concerns over a no-deal Brexit, our then-foreign secretary, now prime minister, said “F*** business.” Relationships with important stakeholders haven’t improved a great deal since. Of course, the biggest stakeholder on the UK side is the British public. Has the UK had an honest conversation with the population about the difficult trade-offs which will need to be made in the negotiation? The answer is no. Because they’ve never leveled with the public about contentious issues, it will be all the more difficult to get buy-in for the deal and for concessions that need to be made. Principle #4: Avoid self-imposed deadlines. While setting deadlines can help to focus minds and inject a sense of momentum into negotiations, I’ve never been a fan. More often than not, they result in ill-thought-out, sub-optimal deals. That was the case with the Withdrawal Agreement, where the UK signed on to a deal that they had to start unravelling just a few months later, and is likely to be the case with the future trade relationship, which has ridiculously tight deadlines. Already, it’s likely that the European Parliament will have to convene between Christmas and New Year’s if there is a deal to be ratified. Principle #5: Behave like a trusted partner – or pay the price. Negotiations, particularly complex negotiations, are built on a bedrock of trust and respect and an understanding that once deals are agreed and signed, there’s no going back unless both sides decide to renegotiate. So the UK government’s decision to draw up legislation – the Internal Market Bill – that overrides the Northern Ireland element of the Withdrawal Agreement and also breaks international law was not a good moment (though it may not be terminal). The EU is now being more demanding about the governance and enforcement mechanisms of a future trade deal, in order to ensure that the UK sticks to its word next time around. At this writing, it looks as if discussions over the legal structures surrounding a future trade deal have gone backwards. The Internal Market Bill contributed to this deterioration. Principle #6: Don’t let political pressure get in the way of pragmatic solutions. The fisheries industry won’t thank me for saying this, but it currently contributes only 0.1% to the UK economy and a similarly low figure across Europe. Compare this to services (over 75%) and manufacturing and production (21%) in the UK. Yet it’s quite possible that a future trade deal could collapse over fisheries. While the right to control one’s own waters has strong symbolic importance and is an issue of supreme importance for many Tory MPs, the really great negotiators tend to put pragmatism before politics and look at the negotiation holistically. Let’s hope that the EU and UK negotiators take that viewpoint in the coming days and weeks. It’s Time To Be Creative If I was to make a prediction, I’d say we are more likely than not to have some kind of bare bones trade deal at the end of the year, with many months of future negotiations to come. After the year that Boris Johnson has had, and the worst economic crisis in 300 years, can he really afford a no-deal outcome, which — while unpalatable to the EU — is even more unappealing to the UK? (The EU market is eight times the size of the UK.) Yet in order to reach agreement, both sides need to be proactive and to take the initiative. When Boris Johnson says things like “the likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU,” it doesn’t help anyone. There is a need for creativity on both sides. Negotiation impasses can sometimes be broken by heads of state or other senior people outside the negotiating teams speaking directly to one another to help regather momentum towards a deal. We are already seeing this in telephone conversations between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. This was also the case in getting the Withdrawal Agreement over the line when the Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in private talks with the then Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to agree on some outstanding issues relating to customs and the Irish border. It’s not too late to learn from the mistakes of the past, but time is running out.

Managing people Managing an Underperformer Who Thinks They’re Doing Great Five ways to close the gap — without crushing their spirit. by Liz Kislik by Liz Kislik December 02, 2020 Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. An underperformer on your team may not realize they have an inflated view of their own less-than-stellar performance. Clearer feedback or stronger supervision may help them thrive, but it’s also possible that they’re not able to recognize that they’re struggling. In any case, managers who fail to address these unaware underperformers risk losing what could be valuable team members or worse, demotivating the rest of their team. Determining the cause of their lack of awareness will either help you figure out what support they need in order to improve, or it will confirm your assessment that they just might not be able to satisfy the requirements of the job. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Almost every leader has been in the uncomfortable position of managing someone who thinks their performance is terrific when it’s actually just adequate, or worse. In fact, in my 30 years of consulting, it’s been one of the more frequent — and draining — performance problems I’ve observed. What causes the mismatch between these employees’ real output and their perceptions of success? Some may not be receiving the resources and clear feedback they need to develop and improve; others may be unable to recognize that they’re struggling. Whatever the cause, if leaders fail to address the situation, the lagging employee’s work will not improve, and the organization will lose the value of a team member who could thrive if given the proper support. Perhaps a more insidious risk is that the leader will appear to condone substandard work, and competent employees may become demotivated and disengage. But if you can identify the likely cause of an underperformer’s lack of self-awareness, these five approaches will help you correct the problem behaviors — or understand whether that’s even possible. Be clear about expectations. A nonprofit client had a congenial work environment and a cultural commitment to understanding each other’s needs. The board chair was exasperated by the lack of results from a particular VP, who believed she was doing fine because she was making an effort. The board chair reminded the VP’s manager, a senior executive, that he was responsible for ensuring results. The manager reinforced performance objectives with the VP, but because he didn’t want to blame her or hurt her feelings, didn’t explain the harm to the organization or the fact that her job was in jeopardy. He continued to lose confidence in the VP and eventually reduced her duties as an indirect way of acknowledging her lack of progress. Both the board chair and the manager later acknowledged that no one had been direct enough with her about her performance problems. Provide employees with resources and support. Most employees need leadership, mentoring, and strong supervision in order to develop, particularly if they’re stepping into a function that’s new to the company or are promoted to fill an absence in the organization. If their natural skills are insufficient to meet the requirements of their role and responsibilities, they may not even perceive what their deficits are. A client company promoted a director to cover the gap left by the sudden departure of an executive two levels up. No one in the senior leadership evaluated the new director’s development needs, despite the fact that he was suddenly responsible for large numbers of people performing varied jobs. The new director assumed he was doing well by virtue of the promotion. But because this more complex job couldn’t be managed like his old one, the director became a burned-out micromanager, creating operating bottlenecks and severe employee dissatisfaction. Determine whether you’re willing to continue investing in the individual. If you’re not, it’s much more practical to reduce your expectations. In response to increasing frustration with a VP who consistently talked a great game but whose results over several years were always just shy of their target, a CEO eventually reassigned some of the riskier and sexier aspects of the VP’s job to another executive. The VP was offended, but stayed — and became more successful with the reduced scope of responsibilities. Assess whether they’ll accept help. It’s emotionally draining to keep faking success or status that’s not legitimate. In contrast to the people who experience imposter syndrome, many others fall victim to the Dunning-Krueger effect, a cognitive bias that prevents people from recognizing how badly they’re performing and that they need help. A mid-level administrator at a client organization bridled at the suggestion that his skills needed to improve and ignored the coaching that was offered to him. He found fault with everyone who questioned him and began setting up his colleagues, undercutting them, and misrepresenting their contributions and concerns. When these actions came to light, the business was forced to let him go. Target praise carefully. When an employee with an inflated sense of their own performance delivers high-quality work or conducts an interaction well, it’s important to praise them. But letting the praise stand alone can encourage them to think that everything they do is outstanding. Connect your positive comments to other things you want them to address. For example, you could say, “Now that you’ve done so well with the ABC presentation, for the next one, I’d like you to also [do the next thing they need to improve]. It’s important because…” Make sure you’re clear about both the necessary new behavior and why it’s required as part of satisfactory job performance. They may still think too highly of themselves, but doing this gives you a better chance of getting the crucial behaviors you need. Helping an unaware underperformer be more realistic about their work requires a lot of attention and involvement. Understanding what’s driving their lack of awareness will either help you determine what support they need in order to improve, or confirm your assessment that they just might not be able to satisfy the requirements of the job.

Communication Don’t Let a Good Story Sell You on a Bad Idea Heed these eight warning signs. by Emre Soyer and Robin M. Hogarth by Emre Soyer and Robin M. Hogarth December 17, 2020 Matthias Clamer/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. Stories are powerful — they were probably a key factor in our species’ evolution, and they’re undoubtedly an important tool in any leader’s toolbox. However, they can also be dangerous, because they can be misleading in subtle ways. These include but are not limited to the following: they tend to make success and failure seem more predictable than they actually are (hindsight); they assert causation where only correlation exists; they look at data sets in blunt, unsophisticated ways; they’re often based on anecdotes; they explain “success” based on factors that many failures in the same cohort display. Don’t ignore stories — but approach them with a critical, skeptical eye. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español There’s no doubt that stories are powerful tools. In Sapiens, historian Yuval Harari argues that the ability to craft stories helped humans cooperate to achieve unprecedented progress and ultimately dominate the world. Today, it’s inconceivable that a product launch, a startup pitch, a popular documentary, or a TED Talk doesn’t feature captivating stories. And with good reason: Stories offer multiple advantages. They help us discern complex matters, remember ideas, communicate with others, and make predictions about the future. It’s important for managers and entrepreneurs to harness these benefits and HBR offers a wide range of content designed to improve storytelling skills. But, precisely because of their potent and lasting effects, it’s crucial for decision makers to recognize the different ways in which stories can be misleading. Authors like Nassim Taleb and Tyler Cowen have provided many warnings about narratives that underrepresent uncertainty and distort our understanding of causality. In HBR articles, Hilary Austen reveals how the allure of stories can lead to biased evaluations and irreversible mistakes in business, and Jonathan Gottschall shows how stories misled decision makers about the truth behind Theranos. In our book The Myth of Experience, we discuss the fact that it’s easier to write and embrace the wrong story than to ignore it. Hence, especially when tackling critical problems and consequential decisions, it pays to become a story skeptic. Some stories simplify reality by warping or ignoring the effect of time. Thus, a first set of warning signs involve time-related biases. Hindsight. Narratives generated after a certain result emerges typically downplay alternative scenarios that could have happened but didn’t. As a result, stories tend to make success and failure seem more predictable and deterministic than they actually are. Yet even outcomes that seem the most obvious in hindsight are often uncertain at the time of the decision. For example, groundbreaking ideas such as photocopying, the modern PC, Google, or Harry Potter felt like foregone conclusions after their immense success. But they were all initially rejected by expert investors, who stood to gain fortunes from them. In fact, in many cases, not even the owners of ideas can accurately predict their own potential. Xerox failed to invest in their own pioneering PC technology, and in its early days, Google tried to sell itself for a tiny fraction of its eventual value. Correlation mistaken for causation. Stories can suggest causality between contemporaneous and correlated events, even when such a link doesn’t actually exist. Urban legends like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx stem from such misperceptions. When an athlete or team makes it to the cover but subsequently underperforms, the magazine gets blamed, even if this result would be expected due to regression to the mean. Similarly, managers can form faulty beliefs about the effects of praise and punishment, especially when the best performers they praise go on to perform worse, and the worst performers they punish subsequently improve. Faulty connections between successive events also fuel conspiracy theories like the supposedly causal links between some vaccines and autism, or certain newly developed technologies and the coronavirus pandemic. Myopia. Some stories fail to spot an existing relationship when causes and effects are far apart in time. Many strategies, like vaccination or the adoption of a new technology, don’t show their effects immediately. To make things more complicated, some investments feature worse-before-better dynamics, which can easily be missed or misinterpreted by stories. Shortsighted narratives lead new leaders to receive acclaim or blame for results occurring right after their appointment even though they may actually be due to previous administrations. Such myopia can prompt management to opt for quick fixes that merely relieve symptoms rather than effective long-term cures. Expiration. Stories are based on the past, so they can quickly become obsolete when situations change suddenly and dramatically. However, the traditions built on them often persist beyond those expiration dates. Only a few decades ago, a college degree would almost certainly guarantee a lucrative career. This is no longer true, but this notion is one cause of the growing student debt crisis. Stories are especially short-lived when processes grow non-linearly, leaving competent decision makers asleep at the wheel. Blockbuster, Myspace, and Nokia all seemed invincible a short time before their rapid downfalls. Some stories simplify reality by omitting a crucial part of the picture. Thus, a second set of warning signs involve selection biases. Averages. Data-based analyses and scientific findings are frequently storified to allow for easier transmission and understanding. However, many such presentations oversimplify reality by limiting discussions to average statistical effects. As a result, one may expect a certain strategy to boost profits, more education to increase income, and grit to produce success. Stories based on these causal links could also fit one’s prior beliefs. Yet they would only be valid for the average of the samples on which they are based and might hide significant risks and nuances around that expected outcome. Anecdotes. It’s appealing to induce overarching stories from personal experience and striking episodes. However, these are just small samples that tend to be unrepresentative. In fact, given wide ranging variabilities in circumstances and personalities, the more unique an observation, the less likely it is to generalize. Many organizations have thus started to favor data-based algorithms over experience-based narratives when they tackle complex decisions. For instance, Michael Lewis’s Moneyball is about the unreliability of anecdotal and experience-based stories when assessing potential performance in baseball. Survivors. Learning from success stories is both fun and motivating. Analyses of the common traits of successful people and organizations are ubiquitous. However, this approach overlooks the fact that these same traits may be equally prevalent in the not-so-successful. Especially when the success rate is low, stories tend to emphasize how uniquely talented and hardworking the successful are. Yet they conveniently ignore scores of failures with similar skills and work ethics, who didn’t achieve the same level of success for all sorts of circumstantial and random reasons. As a result, narratives that suffer from survivorship bias lead to a false belief that success is more controllable and predictable than it is. Outcomes. Stories often focus on observable outcomes while ignoring underlying processes. One consequence is a widespread blindness to possible deceptions and unethical behaviors that contributed to those outcomes. There’s an extensive list of long-running and popular stories based solely on successful outcomes that eventually revealed their dark sides. These cases involved Ponzi schemes, opioid crises, and fraudulent business practices, among other transgressions. Yet another consequence of outcome-based stories is a misunderstanding of how innovation works. Narratives on creativity typically glorify the final versions of successful ideas along with a few flashy creators, while ignoring most of the underlying intricate collaborative processes conducted by scores of risk-taking entrepreneurs. As a result, innovation seems more individualistic and deterministic than it really is. Unfortunately, there are at least two further complications beyond these warning signs. First, some stories can feature a combination of them. They may, for instance, focus exclusively on the successful outcomes of a few surviving anecdotes with the benefit of crystal-clear hindsight. The more warning signs a story shows, the more skepticism is warranted. And second, time-related biases and selection problems can occur even when stories are otherwise factually correct. What we know in hindsight, the final outcomes we observe, and the correlations or the average effects we estimate can indeed be true. Hence, stories can be misleading despite providing information. The solution to the problems of storytelling isn’t to stop telling stories or to ignore them completely. That would deprive us of their vital benefits. Instead, astute decision makers can use stories to their advantage by taking convenient and convincing narratives as theories to be scrutinized, rather than truths to be followed. They would use these warning signs to test, refine, and then update relevant narratives. This would incentivize storytellers to be more careful as they craft their messages. Hence, story skepticism could eventually lead to better and more valid stories, improving our collective learning and decisions.

For instance, Michael Lewis’s Moneyball is about the unreliability of anecdotal and experience-based stories when assessing potential performance in baseball. Survivors. Learning from success stories is both fun and motivating. Analyses of the common traits of successful people and organizations are ubiquitous. However, this approach overlooks the fact that these same traits may be equally prevalent in the not-so-successful. Especially when the success rate is low, stories tend to emphasize how uniquely talented and hardworking the successful are. Yet they conveniently ignore scores of failures with similar skills and work ethics, who didn’t achieve the same level of success for all sorts of circumstantial and random reasons. As a result, narratives that suffer from survivorship bias lead to a false belief that success is more controllable and predictable than it is. Outcomes. Stories often focus on observable outcomes while ignoring underlying processes. One consequence is a widespread blindness to possible deceptions and unethical behaviors that contributed to those outcomes. There’s an extensive list of long-running and popular stories based solely on successful outcomes that eventually revealed their dark sides. These cases involved Ponzi schemes, opioid crises, and fraudulent business practices, among other transgressions. Yet another consequence of outcome-based stories is a misunderstanding of how innovation works. Narratives on creativity typically glorify the final versions of successful ideas along with a few flashy creators, while ignoring most of the underlying intricate collaborative processes conducted by scores of risk-taking entrepreneurs. As a result, innovation seems more individualistic and deterministic than it really is. Unfortunately, there are at least two further complications beyond these warning signs. First, some stories can feature a combination of them. They may, for instance, focus exclusively on the successful outcomes of a few surviving anecdotes with the benefit of crystal-clear hindsight. The more warning signs a story shows, the more skepticism is warranted. And second, time-related biases and selection problems can occur even when stories are otherwise factually correct. What we know in hindsight, the final outcomes we observe, and the correlations or the average effects we estimate can indeed be true. Hence, stories can be misleading despite providing information. The solution to the problems of storytelling isn’t to stop telling stories or to ignore them completely. That would deprive us of their vital benefits. Instead, astute decision makers can use stories to their advantage by taking convenient and convincing narratives as theories to be scrutinized, rather than truths to be followed. They would use these warning signs to test, refine, and then update relevant narratives. This would incentivize storytellers to be more careful as they craft their messages. Hence, story skepticism could eventually lead to better and more valid stories, improving our collective learning and decisions.

Communication Don’t Let a Good Story Sell You on a Bad Idea Heed these eight warning signs. by Emre Soyer and Robin M. Hogarth by Emre Soyer and Robin M. Hogarth December 17, 2020 Matthias Clamer/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Stories are powerful — they were probably a key factor in our species’ evolution, and they’re undoubtedly an important tool in any leader’s toolbox. However, they can also be dangerous, because they can be misleading in subtle ways. These include but are not limited to the following: they tend to make success and failure seem more predictable than they actually are (hindsight); they assert causation where only correlation exists; they look at data sets in blunt, unsophisticated ways; they’re often based on anecdotes; they explain “success” based on factors that many failures in the same cohort display. Don’t ignore stories — but approach them with a critical, skeptical eye. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español There’s no doubt that stories are powerful tools. In Sapiens, historian Yuval Harari argues that the ability to craft stories helped humans cooperate to achieve unprecedented progress and ultimately dominate the world. Today, it’s inconceivable that a product launch, a startup pitch, a popular documentary, or a TED Talk doesn’t feature captivating stories. And with good reason: Stories offer multiple advantages. They help us discern complex matters, remember ideas, communicate with others, and make predictions about the future. It’s important for managers and entrepreneurs to harness these benefits and HBR offers a wide range of content designed to improve storytelling skills. But, precisely because of their potent and lasting effects, it’s crucial for decision makers to recognize the different ways in which stories can be misleading. Authors like Nassim Taleb and Tyler Cowen have provided many warnings about narratives that underrepresent uncertainty and distort our understanding of causality. In HBR articles, Hilary Austen reveals how the allure of stories can lead to biased evaluations and irreversible mistakes in business, and Jonathan Gottschall shows how stories misled decision makers about the truth behind Theranos. In our book The Myth of Experience, we discuss the fact that it’s easier to write and embrace the wrong story than to ignore it. Hence, especially when tackling critical problems and consequential decisions, it pays to become a story skeptic. Some stories simplify reality by warping or ignoring the effect of time. Thus, a first set of warning signs involve time-related biases. Hindsight. Narratives generated after a certain result emerges typically downplay alternative scenarios that could have happened but didn’t. As a result, stories tend to make success and failure seem more predictable and deterministic than they actually are. Yet even outcomes that seem the most obvious in hindsight are often uncertain at the time of the decision. For example, groundbreaking ideas such as photocopying, the modern PC, Google, or Harry Potter felt like foregone conclusions after their immense success. But they were all initially rejected by expert investors, who stood to gain fortunes from them. In fact, in many cases, not even the owners of ideas can accurately predict their own potential. Xerox failed to invest in their own pioneering PC technology, and in its early days, Google tried to sell itself for a tiny fraction of its eventual value. Correlation mistaken for causation. Stories can suggest causality between contemporaneous and correlated events, even when such a link doesn’t actually exist. Urban legends like the Sports Illustrated cover jinx stem from such misperceptions. When an athlete or team makes it to the cover but subsequently underperforms, the magazine gets blamed, even if this result would be expected due to regression to the mean. Similarly, managers can form faulty beliefs about the effects of praise and punishment, especially when the best performers they praise go on to perform worse, and the worst performers they punish subsequently improve. Faulty connections between successive events also fuel conspiracy theories like the supposedly causal links between some vaccines and autism, or certain newly developed technologies and the coronavirus pandemic. Myopia. Some stories fail to spot an existing relationship when causes and effects are far apart in time. Many strategies, like vaccination or the adoption of a new technology, don’t show their effects immediately. To make things more complicated, some investments feature worse-before-better dynamics, which can easily be missed or misinterpreted by stories. Shortsighted narratives lead new leaders to receive acclaim or blame for results occurring right after their appointment even though they may actually be due to previous administrations. Such myopia can prompt management to opt for quick fixes that merely relieve symptoms rather than effective long-term cures. Expiration. Stories are based on the past, so they can quickly become obsolete when situations change suddenly and dramatically. However, the traditions built on them often persist beyond those expiration dates. Only a few decades ago, a college degree would almost certainly guarantee a lucrative career. This is no longer true, but this notion is one cause of the growing student debt crisis. Stories are especially short-lived when processes grow non-linearly, leaving competent decision makers asleep at the wheel. Blockbuster, Myspace, and Nokia all seemed invincible a short time before their rapid downfalls. Some stories simplify reality by omitting a crucial part of the picture. Thus, a second set of warning signs involve selection biases. Averages. Data-based analyses and scientific findings are frequently storified to allow for easier transmission and understanding. However, many such presentations oversimplify reality by limiting discussions to average statistical effects. As a result, one may expect a certain strategy to boost profits, more education to increase income, and grit to produce success. Stories based on these causal links could also fit one’s prior beliefs. Yet they would only be valid for the average of the samples on which they are based and might hide significant risks and nuances around that expected outcome. Anecdotes. It’s appealing to induce overarching stories from personal experience and striking episodes. However, these are just small samples that tend to be unrepresentative. In fact, given wide ranging variabilities in circumstances and personalities, the more unique an observation, the less likely it is to generalize. Many organizations have thus started to favor data-based algorithms over experience-based narratives when they tackle complex decisions. For instance, Michael Lewis’s Moneyball is about the unreliability of anecdotal and experience-based stories when assessing potential performance in baseball. Survivors.

Gender How Iceland Is Closing the Gender Wage Gap Three takeaways from the country’s landmark equal-pay policy. by Ines Wagner by Ines Wagner January 08, 2021 johan10/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Iceland’s equal pay for equal work system is still in the early stages, but initial signs suggest that requiring organizations prove they compensate employees fairly may be very effective. Much more effective, in any case, than the alternatives currently in place elsewhere. Introduced in 2018, the policy requires companies and institutions with more than 25 employees to prove that they pay men and women equally for a job of equal value. If companies show they pay equally for the same positions, they receive certification. Beginning in 2020, certification became a requirement and companies without certification incur a daily fine. The few issues that have thus far emerged, such as the burdensomeness of the process for managers, are start-up problems, moreover, not long-term consequences. And what’s more: the system has stimulated both-in-firm and societal discussions about how jobs are valued, based on what criteria, and whether these criteria are still relevant in the current society and labor market. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español In most countries, men and women doing the same work earn different amounts. This discrimination is popularly known as the gender pay gap. And despite efforts to close it, particularly amongst advanced industrial countries, it persists. Part of the problem is that policy solutions to eradicate unequal pay have focused on changing individual workers’ behavior. More often than not, women are tasked with entering male-dominated professions; or female employees are expected to more effectively assert themselves in the workplace. There may be a better way. In 2018, Iceland introduced the first policy in the world that requires companies and institutions with more than 25 employees to prove that they pay men and women equally for a job of equal value. The policy is implemented through a job evaluation tool called the Equal Wage Management Standard, or simply, the system. If companies show they pay equally for the same positions, they receive certification. Beginning in 2020, certification became a requirement and companies without certification incur a daily fine. Both workers and managers have reported that this job evaluation tool improves the work environment and increases women’s trust in their employers and wage policies. But how exactly does it do that? And can its success be replicated? When I recently conducted the first qualitative analysis of the system, I charted how key economic and political stakeholders in Iceland viewed the consequences of this novel equal pay legislation. From this analysis I found three main factors that enabled the Iceland system’s success and which could similarly ensure successful implementation of equal pay for work of equal value in other places, too. 1. Shift the burden of proof to the employer Usually, the employee must present evidence of inequality in the workplace, but under Iceland’s system, the employer is responsible for evidence that employees are paid fairly. They do this using a two-step job evaluation system to disassociate work tasks from skills, an exercise the managers I spoke to said generally proves difficult. Still, this two-step system forces managers to value the task itself regardless of who is currently in that position. And though managers agreed that the process was burdensome, they appreciated the positive outcomes it resulted in: a straightforward structure, absolving some of the responsibility of individual managers; a confidence in the abilities of — and amongst — new hires; an increase in trust in the employer amongst female employees; and a sense of pride amongst all employees for being part of such a progressive project. 2. Demand evaluation and compliance Research on voluntary employer job evaluation schemes in Canada point to the importance of an effective enforcement system to limit the deterrent effect of the legislation. This is also the case in the Icelandic example. After the implementation process, the system obliges employers to obtain certification from an accredited body to evaluate whether their equal pay scheme meets the system’s requirements. Previous research indicated that equal pay certification schemes are only effective when strongly enforced. The case at hand mandates that employers undergo an external certification process that checks whether their salary system pays equally for work of equal value. In the case of non-compliance, the state issues a daily fine of USD 500. 3. Create transparent pay systems When companies increase accountability and clarity in their performance award system, differences in pay are reduced. Iceland has made transparency mandatory by requiring organizations to create a traceable pay system. Employees now have the right to ask the employer to inform them of the wages and terms under which they are employed. Thus, employers cannot demand that employees enter into wage agreements that includes a provision not to reveal their contents. Such provisions are unlawful and therefore have no validity, shifting the burden of proof from employee to employer and forcing companies to develop or re-think their job evaluation systems. While Iceland’s system is still in the early stages, initial signs suggest that requiring organizations prove they compensate employees fairly may be very effective. Much more effective, in any case, than the alternatives currently in place elsewhere. Companies and institutions adopt the measures needed to receive certification, organizational operations run more smoothly, and employees are happier. The few issues that have thus far emerged, such as the burdensomeness of the process for managers, are start-up problems, moreover, not long-term consequences. And what’s more: the system has stimulated both-in-firm and societal discussions about how jobs are valued, based on what criteria, and whether these criteria are still relevant in the current society and labor market. Understandably, all of this positively impacted the organizational culture and shows that the process of wage formulation between a manager and an individual is never a technical matter — instead, a social process predominates in determining salary. This underlines the importance of the system: a pay raise or promotion depends on pre-defined and mutually agreed criteria as opposed to a manager’s mood or personal preferences, recognition, or an employee’s negotiation skills or vocalness about accomplishments.

Leadership & Managing people Making the Hybrid Workplace Fair New working arrangements will create new power dynamics. Here’s how managers can prepare. by Mark Mortensen and Martine Haas by Mark Mortensen and Martine Haas February 24, 2021 Illustration by Jason Schneider Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Thanks to the benefits for both employers and employees, hybrid work arrangements will likely persist beyond the pandemic. In order for them to work, though, leaders must understand the power differentials they create within teams and take steps to level the playing field. Where individuals (including the manager) on a team are located relative to others matters, as does each individual’s skills in relationship building. The authors offer four strategies managers can take to manage the structurally inevitable differences in power that arise in a hybrid environment. Not doing so can damage relationships, impede effective collaboration, and ultimately reduce performance. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español The pandemic has upended much about how we work, and what comes next is neither the death of the office nor a return to the way things were. Instead, our new reality will be hybridity: working with employees who are co-located in the same physical space as well as employees working remotely. Hybridity promises organizations the benefits of remote working (increased flexibility, reduced carbon footprint, labor-cost optimization, and increased employee satisfaction) alongside the critical strengths of traditional, co-located work (smoother coordination, informal networking, stronger cultural socialization, greater creativity, and face-to-face collaboration). But hybridity is also inextricably tied to power — it creates power differentials within teams that can damage relationships, impede effective collaboration, and ultimately reduce performance. To lead effectively in a hybrid environment, managers must recognize and actively manage the two distinct sources of power that can impede — or facilitate — hybrid work: hybridity positioning and hybridity competence. How Hybridity Positioning Affects Power First, hybridity means that, due to where they’re positioned, employees have different access to resources and different levels of visibility — both key sources of power and influence. Resource access differs depending on whether the employee is located in the office or outside of it. Employees in the office have ready and quick access to technology and infrastructure to support their work. They tend to have faster and easier access to information, and that information tends to be more current and broad (including informal water-cooler conversations), which provides them with an edge when it comes to the rapid changes of today’s environment. Being in the office also provides access to the emotional and task-based social support provided by peers. Insight Center Collection Keeping Your Workforce Up and Running Adapt fast amid constant change. In contrast, employees who work remotely often find their weaker technological setup and infrastructure (slow connections, inability to access certain resources from home, a less sophisticated home office setup) makes it more difficult to demonstrate their competence. Not being present for informal interactions leaves remote workers feeling out of the loop and last to know. Being remote may also lead employees to feel more isolated and lacking the relationships and connections that provide social support. Visibility level, or being seen by those in power, is also shaped by an employee’s location — especially their location relative to their boss and senior managers. Working in the same space as the boss increases the likelihood that employees’ efforts and actions will be recognized and top of mind. Employees who are seen in the hallways are likely to come to mind when it’s time to staff an important new project, and their actions on that project are likely to be recognized, resulting in credit for a job well done. Even if the boss is working remotely, when an employee is based in the office, it increases the likelihood that their actions will be seen by others and reported to the boss indirectly. When working remotely, no one sees the late nights or early mornings or how hard employees are working to deliver on their obligations. Credit for a collective output is likely to be unevenly attributed most to those who are there in the office and more visible. Taking these two dimensions of hybridity positioning together, we can understand how hybridity affects each employee in a team or work group by thinking in terms of where the employee and manager are situated. How Hybridity Competence Affects Power Not all individuals are equally skilled at operating within a hybrid environment. The ability to effectively navigate in a hybrid environment is itself a skill and therefore a source of power. Hybridity requires employees to be ambidextrous — able to balance between and navigate across both worlds — in a way that fully co-located or fully remote working don’t. Employees who are strong at relationship building, both face-to-face and virtually, have an advantage in hybrid environments, as do those who are willing to ask for, find, and claim the resources they may not have easy access to. Employees with good network and political awareness are able to recognize advantageous positions and situations, and those who establish strong relationships that can transcend the gap between face-to-face and remote working can use informal connections to replace missing information. Hybrid environments reward employees who think and act adaptably and flexibly, who are able to organize and coordinate across a complex and dynamic environment, and who are able to establish and provide evidence of their own trustworthiness when working in a context of low visibility. On the other hand, employees who are less effective at building relationships in either in-person or remote environments may find themselves struggling to work with collaborators who do work that way. Those who are less skilled at coordinating work within such a complex system may find they’re constantly out of sync with colleagues and managers. Hybridity competence is a separate source of power from hybridity positioning. Someone in a disadvantaged position may still be able to work very effectively if they have high hybridity competence, while someone in an advantaged position may still be ineffective if they have low hybridity competence. The Managerial Challenge While employees need to ensure that they’re visible to their managers and can access the resources they need for their work, managers similarly need to make sure they stay informed about what their employees are doing and facilitate their access to those resources. Managers who are co-located with their employees have more information about what and how those employees are doing. Managers who are remote from their employees may feel like they’re operating in the dark. Incomplete information is nothing new, but hybridity’s real threat is to fairness. Here are four ways managers can actively manage the structurally inevitable differences in power that arise in a hybrid environment and their effects. Track and communicate. Create an accurate map of your team’s “hybridity configuration”: who is working where, and when. Once you’ve mapped this out, you need to have a conversation with them to surface the challenges they and you face and discuss what you can do to overcome them. Always bear in mind that your employees’ resource access depends on their location, and their visibility depends on their location relative to you. Making this task more complex is that hybridity is itself dynamic — a result of variations both across employees (“Martine works in the office, Mark works from home”) and for individual employees (“I work in the office MWF and at home TT”). This makes hybridity a moving target. It requires ongoing systematic tracking, codifying, and visualizing to help both managers and employees stay aware of the configuration of hybridity in a given work group and manage the resulting power dynamics. Design. While some level of power imbalance is structurally inevitable in a hybrid team or work group, when necessary and possible, managers should intervene to redistribute power through shifting access to resources and/or visibility levels. At the same time, policies and procedures should be revisited regularly to ensure they don’t provide an unfair advantage based on hybridity — for example, KPIs that don’t align with resource accessibility, or evaluations that don’t account for differences in visibility levels. Educate. Many of these issues arise not solely from hybridity itself, but from a lack of awareness of the power imbalances it creates. To effectively manage in hybrid environments, managers must promote awareness of the issues and educate employees (and themselves) on how to avoid bias. Particularly important is establishing a culture of psychological safety and (individual/collective) trust. This will increase the likelihood of employees speaking up and asking for resources when they need them, as well as their confidence that their efforts will be recognized. Monitor. With this understanding in mind, it’s important that managers keep an eye out for key intervention moments. Through our discussions with executives, we’ve identified a number of key opportunities to address the potential challenges of hybridity for power dynamics within their teams: Performance reviews and evaluations. Managers must remain acutely aware of how hybridity creates an imbalance in their teams with respect to employees’ access to resources and visibility levels, as well as the information that they hold about their employees. Reviews present an opportunity for managers and employees to review and discuss imbalances and how to address them going forward. Team launches. Hybrid teams start with team members who are not on the same footing. Team launches are an opportunity for managers and team members to recognize, acknowledge, and discuss power differences and to decide how collectively to manage them. Onboarding. How can managers bring people into the organization when not everyone can physically come to the office? How can they put their new remote hires on a comparable footing to those who are brought into a face-to-face office environment? Hybridity’s impacts on group dynamics need to be incorporated into onboarding sessions and discussions in order to ensure new employees recognize the importance of consciously managing hybridity-based sources of power. For companies to reap the many benefits of hybrid working, managers must be aware of the power dynamics at play. It’s critical that they develop an understanding of hybridity positioning and hybridity competence and take steps to level the playing field for their teams.

Finance & Accounting How Midsize Companies Can Use Data to Compete with Digital Giants A three-step path to sustainable growth. by Jonathan Byrnes and John Wass by Jonathan Byrnes and John Wass February 22, 2021 Jorg Greuel/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. The pandemic has hit midsize companies hard and rewarded Amazon and the other digital giants. Many midsize business leaders look at the growth of those giants and worry that there’s no place for them to prosper. In fact, there’s a large, wide-open playing field for incumbent firms to reposition. The key to your midsize company’s survival in the post-pandemic period is to use the data you have readily available to identify your profit peaks and profit drains and strategically align your organization around your profit core to build dominance in your target market segments. The authors offer three steps that will provide a proven pathway to sustained, defensible profit growth in the post-pandemic period and throughout the era beyond. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español The pandemic has changed the business environment dramatically, both for B2C and B2B companies. Consumer behavior has shifted from in-store to online, and to a significant extent, it will not shift back. The flood of home deliveries has bankrupted scores of firms who traditionally relied on in-person interactions, with midsize companies (with limited resources) hit especially hard. In the B2B markets, buyer behavior has shifted just as dramatically. Electronic orders have displaced sales calls in many companies; one industrial distributor, for example, has seen its digital business climb steadily, now reaching over 60%. The digital giants have benefited from this shift and have grown in size and capability. Wayfair, for example, is rapidly taking over huge swaths of the furniture market, and Amazon is relocating its local distribution facilities to enable two-hour deliveries of its various products. All companies have to adjust — but in particular, midsize ones, who are very vulnerable but also potentially very agile. Their vulnerability stems from having fewer resources than their giant competitors and less diversification to shield against the impact of price wars. They can be agile if they have the resources to reposition and less-entrenched bureaucracies, which makes it easier to innovate and change. When the pandemic hit, Edison Furniture had a problem. Like most furniture retailers, Edison (not its real name) made most of its profits selling mattresses. Internet sellers and off-price local stores were steadily eating into those profits. Insight Center Collection Keeping Your Workforce Up and Running Adapt fast amid constant change. The company surveyed its large customers and found that most were price buyers. As a midsize retailer with a half-dozen large, costly stores, it was stuck in a price war that seemed hopeless. As the pandemic drove customers away from shopping at stores, profits plunged. In response, Edison’s management decided to try analyzing its profitability in a new way suggested by one of its directors: They created a database of their sales transactions, and rather than allocating costs on a blanket basis, they assigned their actual costs to each transaction. What they saw was amazing: About 20% of their customers accounted for half of their revenues but produced over more than 130% of their profits (i.e., “profit peak” customers). About 30% of their customers accounted for a third of their revenues but drained more than 50% of their profits (i.e., “profit drain” customers). The remaining 50% of their customers accounted for about 20% of their revenues but produced less than 10% of their profits (i.e., “profit desert” customers). When Edison’s managers saw this profit segmentation, they realized that their price-war strategy was a response to their profit drain customers’ demands, and they were essentially ignoring their high-profit customers. They quickly sent a brief survey to their large customers, separating the profit peak customers from the profit drains. They found that the profit peak customers were very retailer loyal and often had a favorite sales rep. While they weren’t necessarily wealthy, they were relatively insensitive to prices. The profit drain customers, however, were price shoppers. They started by shopping at Edison’s store, then comparison shopped on the internet, and finally returned to Edison to demand that they match the price. This was the big problem — and opportunity. Edison’s managers took several steps to address their problem: They created icons in their Salesforce system representing each customer’s profit segment (e.g., profit peak customer) so they could recognize these premier customers when they entered the store and send them to their favorite reps. They offered them special services like off-hours shopping, priority on special sales, and focused internet deals. They instructed their sales reps not to bargain with the profit drainers, whom they could also recognize from Salesforce. They were surprised to find that most of these customers bought from the store anyway to avail themselves of Edison’s renowned service. They instructed their merchandisers to develop private-label lines, which the profit peak customers preferred and which were also more profitable. They changed their advertising theme from low price to high quality and high service. They stationed their “master” drivers, who excelled in customer service, in profit peak customers’ neighborhoods and had the other drivers shuttle loads to them. These master drivers handled all of the key customer interactions and scouted for their additional furniture needs while making the deliveries, leading to multiple sales. Edison’s profits skyrocketed, and in the process, they carved out a defensible, high-growth strategy that the digital giants and off-price competitors couldn’t match with their low-service, low-price strategies. Many midsize business leaders look at the growth of Amazon and the other digital giants and worry that there’s no place for them to prosper. In fact, those giants have a very focused strategy — arm’s-length services to small customers — which leaves a large, wide-open playing field for incumbent firms to reposition. Edison’s successful story highlights the three steps that midsize company leaders need to take for success in post-pandemic markets. Step 1: Choose Your Customer Edison succeeded by identifying and developing a high-profit, defensible strategy that the digital giants could not follow, and it said “no” to customers that didn’t fit its target profile. For midsize companies like Edison, focusing their strategic positioning and driving focused growth in today’s rapidly changing environment is a life-or-death necessity. This involves choosing your customers to target defensible, profitable market segments while avoiding those that are vulnerable to digital giant incursion; aligning your scarce resources to capture and grow your target segments; and managing your organization to meet your diverging and changing customer needs within your target segments. Midsize companies also have to act quickly and decisively, because if they lose their target markets to competitors, they may not be able to recover them. Potentially getting in the way of this is that many midsize company managers instinctively try to cling to all revenues and cut all costs, instead of carefully aiming and aligning their companies. Doubling down on the traditional strategy of choosing all customers — which is no strategy at all — coupled with across-the-board belt-tightening is a recipe for disaster. Step 2: Align Your Resources Edison aligned its resources around the processes and technologies that supported its chosen customers. Successful realigning of resources requires accurate, granular profit analytics that show the profitability of every nook and cranny of your company and enable you to project the consequences of potential market changes and competitive incursions. Strategic repositioning requires a detailed understanding of which customers and products are in your current profit core (i.e., your profit peaks), along with a projection of how the changing environment and aggressive competitors are altering the profit potential of your markets. And, as competitors vie for repositioning success, you only have one chance to get this right before your options evaporate. Today’s business environment creates both a huge opportunity and a major problem. The opportunity is that companies have the ability to carve out new businesses that are completely defensible against price-cutting competitors who have sophisticated digital marketing and a lower cost structure (because they simply send their products to their customers). The rise of the digital giants originated with their ability to market directly to customers, which enabled them to create micro-segments and configure offers to individuals at scale using big data and algorithmic recommendations based on captured customer information. It’s extremely hard to win against these focused giants in a head-to-head contest. Yet many managers, especially in midsize companies, try to do this when they attempt to defend their broad market strategies, instead of repositioning to dominate the defensible segments of their markets. The problem is that in the high-service realm where most of these opportunities reside, customer needs are fragmenting rapidly: Different customers want different packages of products and related services. Historically, most companies sold and delivered only a relatively narrow set of products and services to as many customers as possible in homogeneous mass markets. Step 3: Manage Your Organization Edison developed effective new transaction-based metrics and managed the coordination of its key functional areas — sales, products, and customer relationships — to produce the services their target customers wanted. The best news was that this repositioning didn’t require a large investment. The money they saved avoiding discounting paid for the whole program and produced ample profit growth. When managers try to calculate the profits from their expanding variety of customers and products in order to choose their targets and track their success, they encounter a big problem: Traditional accounting systems cannot match each revenue increment with the actual cost of producing it. Standard metrics, like revenue and cost, show the company’s average profitability, but not the profitability of particular segments of customers and products. The problem is that traditional accounting categories tell you whether your company is making money, but not where it’s making money. Companies now require a completely new way to analyze profitability below the averages of their traditional P&Ls, all the way down to the invoice-line level, which we call transaction-based profit metrics and analytics. Using new state-of-the-art software, managers carefully assign the appropriate costs to each transaction (invoice line), creating an all-in P&L for each order line (the actual costs can be derived from a company’s general ledger). Because each order line has a set of unique identifiers (for example, customer, product, store, sales rep, delivery), it’s possible to combine and recombine the relevant transactions on a monthly basis to show the actual profitability of every segment of the company, down to each product bought by each customer each time. This is especially important because it shows a company’s rapidly shifting profit peaks and drains, which were hidden by the average metrics, and it enables managers to identify their emerging opportunities and risks quickly. Surviving in a New Era of Business We’ve entered a new era of business. We’re experiencing the end of the mass market era and accelerating into a new one, which we call the “age of diverse markets.” In the age of mass markets, which lasted through most of the previous century, the development of roads, mass production, and mass communications integrated the nation’s markets and created strong economies of scale. In response, companies sold relatively narrow product lines to as many customers as possible to maximize revenues and minimize costs. In the age of diverse markets, which started accelerating around 2000, digital companies increasingly used the internet to micro-segment and fragment their markets, selling directly to consumers. In response, savvy incumbent firms increasingly shifted to higher-service strategies, which further fragmented the markets. The pandemic has accelerated this change. The key to survival in the post-pandemic period and throughout this new era is to use the data you have readily available to identify your profit peaks and profit drains and strategically align your organization around your profit core (both current profits and your projected defensible market positioning) in order to build dominance in your target market segments. The three steps to midsize company success will provide a proven pathway to sustained, defensible profit growth in the post-pandemic period and throughout the era beyond.

Behavioral economics How Employers Can Reduce Vaccine Hesitancy Twelve strategies backed by behavioral economics. by Jessica H. Jones, Jeff Levin-Scherz, and Julie Noblick by Jessica H. Jones, Jeff Levin-Scherz, and Julie Noblick March 02, 2021 Boston Globe/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Employers have a central role to play in the drive to persuade people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. This article offers 12 strategies that leverage the power of behavioral economics. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Vaccines can only end this pandemic and prevent even more death and economic disruption if enough people get them, allowing a country to achieve herd immunity. Employers can play an essential role in achieving that goal by embracing the tenets of behavioral economics to combat vaccine hesitancy. Emphasize stories over statistics. When the global death toll of the pandemic exceeded 2 million people in January, journalists made valiant attempts to help us wrap our minds around the scope of the crisis, saying, “It’s as if 10 of the world’s largest commercial jets fell out of the sky, every day for an entire year.” While this figure is jaw-dropping, statistics or graphs fail to capture the agonizing reality of losing a parent, sibling, neighbor, or coworker. Employers should offer a platform for employees who may be willing to share their story of loss or becoming seriously ill from the virus. This will not only help employees heal emotionally but also has the power to encourage them to take action. People are more likely to believe they can get sick or infect others after hearing this happened to someone they know personally. Focus on immediate rather than long-term benefits. People place far more value on what they can attain immediately, so the promise that a vaccine can lead to the end of pandemic restrictions months or years from now is not enough to motivate action. Communications should focus on immediate benefits, like those who are vaccinated can return to the grocery store or hairstylist with less worry they could bring infection home to their family. But emphasize that even those who are vaccinated should continue to wear masks and distance until we reach herd immunity. Stress that vaccination will be necessary for some activities. In their employee communications, organizations should certainly emphasize the primary benefit of getting vaccinated: avoiding getting sick and spreading a deadly illness to family, friends, and coworkers. However, those communications should also point out other benefits — for example, vaccines are likely to be required in the future for future domestic or international travel or even to attend concerts or sporting events. Protect employees from any loss associated with getting vaccinated. Be sure vaccination itself doesn’t cause employees to suffer a loss. Some employers are offering the equivalent of two to four hours of pay so that hourly employees do not suffer a financial loss when they take time away from work to get vaccinated. There should be no out-of-pocket cost to the recipient. Use social networks. Humans like to do what their friends and neighbors are doing. This makes social networks a powerful tool to encourage vaccination. For many, the workplace remains one of their most important social networks. Just as many influencers show videos of themselves receiving the vaccine, employers can put stickers on ID badges and vaccine sites can distribute easily visible buttons to those who are vaccinated. Using social networks to promote vaccination will be especially important in communities of color, where a long history of medical discrimination has led to a higher rate of vaccine hesitancy. That’s why it’s important to highlight that a Black woman, Kizzmekia Corbett, was one of the key scientists who developed the Moderna vaccine, and that the first vaccination in the New York City was administered to and by Black health care workers. Make getting vaccinated easy. Getting the vaccine should be easy. Appointments should be simple to book by phone or online and should be offered at as many locations as possible, including employer sites when increased supplies of vaccines make that possible. In the United States, employers can cover fees for administering the vaccines in both the medical and pharmacy benefit. Employers can create calendar holds for on-site vaccination if that becomes available. This is especially important for the second shot of two-dose vaccines, which should be given in a narrow time window. Behavioral economists call this “choice architecture.” Seek commitment. There’s a reason political campaigns ask voters to sign cards committing to voting or supporting a candidate. Once we have publicly stated our position, we are more receptive to confirmation bias, meaning we seek out information that confirms our point of view and overlook information that doesn’t. Employers should encourage their employees to sign up for vaccinations as soon as they are eligible, even if there is a wait. And executives and other influential leaders should express their commitment to being vaccinated, even if they are not yet eligible. Don’t mandate vaccines before they are widely accepted. The U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission allows employers to mandate vaccines if necessary for workplace safety but requires consideration of religious or medical objections. However, that doesn’t mean this is a good time for a vaccine mandate. Let’s not force people to declare their opposition to the vaccine when almost a third of the population says they want to wait and see how the vaccine is working. Those who aren’t willing to get the vaccine just yet will likely be much more amenable at a later point when they see their friends, coworkers, and families gaining benefits from the safe vaccines and when they need to show proof of vaccination for recreational or other non-work activities. Frame choices to highlight the value of the vaccine. Provide context to help employees understand the value of vaccinations. Some employees might worry that the vaccines have only early use authorization rather than full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and therefore are risky. Explain to them that the vaccines have already been given to tens of millions of people with minimal negative results. Complication rates remain very low, and no deaths have been definitively caused by the vaccines. Meanwhile, there have been more than 500,000 deaths from the pandemic in the United States and more than 2.5 million globally. There are now unfortunate reports that some are refusing certain vaccines because of early reports that they are less effective than others. Remind employees that the Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have all been shown to decrease hospitalizations by more than 99%. We have begun talking about an increase in “vaccine confidence” rather than a decrease in “vaccine hesitancy.” Overcome the tendency to underestimate common risks. Individuals are subject to optimism bias, which means they believe that they are less likely to suffer a bad outcome than statistics would suggest. For instance, smokers continue to smoke even though they know that cigarettes lead to premature death, and stock car racers continue to race even though they know that life-threatening accidents are common. With Covid-19, many underestimate their risk of being exposed or having a severe case or lasting effects if infected. In their communications to encourage vaccinations, employers can overcome this bias by focusing on decreasing the risk of transmitting the illness to loved ones and pointing to herd immunity as a necessary step to return to the many activities we miss. Avoid overwhelming employees. When we are presented with too many choices and too much information, we often freeze and revert to a default of making no choice at all. Shoppers offered too many samples at a store actually purchase fewer sampled items. The torrent of information about Covid-19 might also paralyze employees and decrease vaccination rates. Employers should provide easily understood information about why, how, and where they can get vaccinated. Vaccination will be a choice, but let’s make it an easy choice. Be fair! People hate unfairness, even if they themselves aren’t harmed by the inequity. Leaders should model their enthusiasm about getting the vaccine but make sure that vaccines are quickly offered to frontline workers and those at highest risk. A retailer would not want to vaccinate its executive board chairman while leaving cashiers unprotected! If companies are administering vaccine, they should offer it to all similarly situated employees as supplies allow. The appearance of unfair administration of vaccine not only opens employers to negative press but also could also lead angry employees to forego vaccination. The Covid-19 pandemic represents the greatest public health challenge in a century. To combat it, we need to increase public acceptance of safe, highly effective vaccines. By using the behavioral economic toolkit to promote vaccination of employees and their families, employers can help us achieve herd immunity and thereby prevent further illness, death, and further economic disruption.

Organizational culture Boeing and the Importance of Encouraging Employees to Speak Up It shouldn’t take a tragedy to fix a culture. by Amy C. Edmondson by Amy C. Edmondson May 01, 2019, Updated May 04, 2019 Miguel Navarro/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. What does it take to change a culture? Too often the answer is disaster. In the aftermath of the two fatal accidents of Boeing 737 Max jets, tentatively blamed on the over-automation of Boeing’s flight systems, renewed attention to Boeing production facilities was perhaps an inevitability. Evidence is now trickling out that workers in the troubled Boeing 737 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina were pushed to maintain an overly ambitious production schedule and fearful of losing their jobs if they raised concerns. This is a textbook case of how the absence of psychological safety — the assurance that one can speak up, offer ideas, point out problems, or deliver bad news without fear of retribution — can lead to disastrous results.

In the aftermath of the two fatal accidents of Boeing 737 Max jets, tentatively blamed on the over-automation of Boeing’s flight systems, renewed attention to Boeing production facilities was perhaps inevitable. Evidence is now trickling out that workers in the troubled Boeing 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina were pushed to maintain an overly ambitious production schedule and fearful of losing their jobs if they raised concerns. This is a textbook case of how the absence of psychological safety — the assurance that one can speak up, offer ideas, point out problems, or deliver bad news without fear of retribution — can lead to disastrous results. The accidents and the resulting media attention together create a real wake-up call for Boeing, which I expect will now embark on an examination of every aspect of its operations. What’s required, however, is more than operational fixes. It is nothing less than a full organizational culture change. But how telling it is that it takes a cataclysmic event (two, actually) for executives to take culture seriously? And yet, sadly, this is the way a thoroughgoing change in the culture of an organization happens most often: AFTER a big, visible failure or tragic event. Let’s back up to consider how this comes about, from an organizational behavior point of view. We humans are finely attuned to risk. That ought to work in our favor, especially when it comes to things like engineering safety systems for airplanes. The trouble is, we are attuned mostly to interpersonal risk. We spontaneously overvalue maintaining a sense of comfort, security, and even belonging in the moment, and undervalue the vague, probably-won’t-even-happen, potentiality in the far-off future. Psychologists have a term for it: discounting the future. It’s simple human nature. We don’t want to ruffle feathers. We don’t want to be the Cassandra. We don’t want to be thought of as stupid when we say: “I just don’t see how this is going to work.” We don’t want a dressing down when we point out a quality problem. On top of that, the incentives embedded in most workplaces conspire against 1) employees speaking up and 2) managers actually hearing them. My colleague Bob Sutton of Stanford has written that “bosses live in a fool’s paradise,” often of their own making: “Bearers of bad news, even when they aren’t responsible for it in any sense, tend to be blamed and to have negative feelings directed toward them. The result is the ‘mum effect:’ subordinates with good survival instincts soften bad news to make it sound better, or avoid passing it along to their bosses at all. Therefore, in a steep hierarchy it is a happier and happier story that reaches the top ranks.” Unless. Unless the culture — and by culture I especially mean the behavior of managers up and down the line — vehemently and continuously supports psychological safety. In some unusual workplaces, organizational leaders — at the top, middle, and frontlines — have worked hard to create a culture of speaking up. Leaders of Pixar Animation, for example, created a mechanism they call “the brain trust” to institutionalize feedback. The brain trust has clear rules: comments must be constructive and aimed at the project and not the person; all must be ready to hear the truth; and no one takes anything personally. Barry-Wehmiller, the $3 billion global engineering firm, holds regular listening sessions, where employees speak their minds. And Toyota has its famous Andon cord, which ANY employee with a safety or quality problem (or even a potential safety or quality problem — because doubt and ambiguity are welcome at Toyota) can pull, no matter their rank, to instantly trigger a learning process. It’s worth noting that only 1 in 12 Andon cord pulls actually stops the assembly line. But all 12 trigger instant curiosity and collaborative problem solving. There are various ways to get the culture change job done, but the common ingredient is institutionalizing the behavior of speaking up. I detail all of this, with practical tips and stories of success and failure, in my new book, The Fearless Organization. Some successful practices: Explicitly setting times, places, and structures for team members to speak their minds. Making these happen frequently, so the “ouch” is diluted and people become accustomed to lively back-and-forth. Setting rules of engagement, with broad input, and writing them down as a set of norms that becomes part of everyone’s lexicon. It’s an upstream swim to build and maintain a fearless organization. It means battling the natural tendencies of humans in groups. But companies like Toyota make it a priority because they understand the world is a fast-changing, risky, competitive place, and without all hands (eyes, and voices) on deck, the company is at risk of dramatic failures and, more insidiously, of creeping complacency, with its terrible consequences. It needn’t take a tragedy to change a culture. What’s needed is speaking up and tuning in. Editor’s note: We have updated the text of this article to reflect that the Boeing Dreamliner is a 787, not a 737.

Conflict The Wrong Way to Respond to Employee Activism Three common traps and how to avoid them. by Megan Reitz, John Higgins, and Emma Day-Duro by Megan Reitz, John Higgins, and Emma Day-Duro February 26, 2021 HBR Staff/Grant Ritchie/Unsplash Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Leaders tend to be ill-equipped to handle outspoken employees. But with employee activism on the rise, leaders need to be wary of mishandling their response. These missteps can be damaging for leaders and companies, which can suffer from reputational damage and ongoing employee unrest. The authors’ research into how employees speak up at work and politics in the workplace have shown that three fundamental traps snare leaders facing activism from their employees: over-optimism, a belief that you can be apolitical, and a rush to quick fixes. By better understanding where each of these approaches go wrong, leaders can chart a better course, one that is built on a more authentically engaged leadership. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Employee activism is on the rise and we expect it to become a defining feature of the workplace in the coming years. Employees are increasingly aware of social inequality and climate change and how their companies contribute to these ills, with millennials in particular seeming to be unwilling to turn a blind eye to their employers’ complicity. Climate strikes, calls for unionization, and support for Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement are becoming part of the reality in organizations, reinforced by the growing pressure from investors targeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aims. But our last seven years of research into how employees speak up at work — and our more recent research into politics in the workplace specifically — have shown us that leaders tend to be ill-equipped to handle their outspoken employees. That’s understandable. That social, environmental, and political issues should even have airtime at work creates a more problematic employer-employee contract than most leaders are used to and exposes them to a minefield of values and perspectives they are frequently ill-equipped to engage with. Still, missteps in handling employee activism can be damaging for leaders and companies. For example, Wayfair’s nonresponse to employees asking the company to stop supplying furniture to inhumane immigrant holding facilities resulted in well-publicized walkouts that brought much more negative attention to the company. Amazon’s heavy handed crackdown on employee activists has done little to slow movement toward unionization, and has prompted a high-level resignation. Talented employees are increasingly poised to wrest power from management — or turn to competitors — and consumers stand at the ready to support employees and take their business elsewhere. There are three fundamental traps that snare leaders facing activism from their employees: over-optimism, a belief that you can be apolitical, and a rush to quick fixes. Let’s look at each more closely — and then examine how you can avoid them. The Optimism Bubble When we asked the CEO of a large manufacturing organization about his response to growing employee activism, he leaned forward with a puzzled expression on his face. In a somewhat conspiratorial whisper, he said, “I think we’ll be fine. We’ve always run a meritocracy and people just get on with it. If people think something they generally just speak up.” But the survey we had just conducted at his organization pointed to a very different reality: one in which environmental and social concerns bubbled just below the surface, with employees afraid to bring them up. Our research on speaking truth to power clearly highlights that the more senior you are, the more optimistic you become. As a result, you are more likely to underestimate the challenges your employees face and their feelings around so-called activist issues, whilst overestimating the degree to which they feel safe to speak up to you (and your skills in listening to points of view that don’t match with your take on the world). This is partly because your powerful position may mean you are intimidating to others, so you don’t hear what needs to be heard. It is also due to advantage blindness – leaders tend to carry multiple labels that convey status, for example, CEO, white, or male. When you have these labels, you can be the last person to realize how impactful they are. It isn’t until you don’t have those labels that you can really experience how consequential they are on the ability to speak up — and be heard. The optimism bubble means that leaders can dismiss activism as rebellion: unnecessarily disruptive behavior. As a result, they pay no heed to growing dissatisfaction until it is too late. In the case of the optimistic CEO we worked with, he was oblivious to the fact that talented employees had begun to move to competitors because of their dissatisfaction with his approach, including the influential and insightful head of one of their employee networks. Avoiding the optimism bubble requires you to take seriously the prospect that you are out of touch. Reverse mentoring and shadow boards can all help get the voice of a younger generation into your head. Employee network groups can be the organization’s antennae. And increasing organizational diversity through recruitment and promotion might force you out of an echo chamber of similar, passive, and uncritical opinions. Yet, to work, all of these steps require you to listen to be changed, rather than to defend and rebut. Believing You Can Be Apolitical In a blog post that swiftly went viral last year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong directed employees to be “laser-focused” on the company’s mission and to cease to “engage in broader societal issues when they’re unrelated to our core mission.” He concluded that employees who wished to be at “an activism-focused” company would be helped to move elsewhere. Over 60 employees took him at his word and have subsequently left the company. Appearing apolitical can be appealing when it seems so dangerous for leaders to do anything else. Some observers applauded Armstrong’s statement as the safest way for a business to operate. After all, by taking a stand, companies can lay themselves open to being cancelled or accused of playing politics, affecting their reputation with investors, customers, and potential employees. The trouble is that the view that it is possible to be apolitical reveals a failure to understand that inaction is not neutral: it is also a political statement and stance. It also opens the company to criticism on the very issue it was hoping to avoid. For example, McKinsey recently mandated that its staff in Moscow stay neutral during recent political demonstrations. But staying off the streets also served Vladimir Putin’s agenda, as was pointed out in a Financial Times column. In response to the backlash, McKinsey’s Global Communications Director, Ramiro Prudencio, issued a mea culpa in the newspaper a few days later. Avoiding the apolitical trap requires leaders to accept that stakeholders can ostracize them for views that they offer — or the ones that they don’t. A Rush to Quick Fixes Human beings tend to be uncomfortable with ambiguity. Leaders and managers, because they have been told on numerous occasions that they are supposed to “manage” change and be in control, are perhaps particularly uneasy and are notoriously swift in their grasp for quick solutions. But that can mean insufficiently thought-through reactions to employee activism, in particular over-promising and under-delivering. Leaders and companies that fail to truly practice what they preach often find themselves at the mercy of the same public judgment they sought to avoid. For example, firms such as BlackRock, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestle have all recently faced accusations of either simply going through the motions when it comes to environmental issues, or saying one thing to one group while lobbying behind the scenes to achieve another. Similarly, as numerous organizations rushed to make statements in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, many ended up being accused of running communication exercises as quick fixes with nothing to stimulate or support meaningful change underneath them. To avoid the quick fixes trap, have your executive team discuss their overall approach to employee activism as part of your strategic plan — being proactive, not just reactive, can help to avoid panicked responses. Link executive renumeration to ESG targets to encourage action and not just words. In our analysis, avoiding all these traps depends on something more fundamental but less easily engineered than corporate process or policy changes. That is the degree to which you as an organizational leader are aware of, care for, and see yourself as responsible for wider societal issues beyond the boundaries of your corporate remit. Leaders who fail to see themselves and their actions as part of that larger system tend to be those who don’t see developing problems, embrace inaction as neutral, rush to half-hearted solutions — and suffer the consequences along with their organizations. We recommend asking yourself and your colleagues these two underlying questions deeply and regularly: What are the larger shifts in society around the globe that will have an impact on the values your people and customers will take for granted within the next few years? What are the intended and unintended impacts your leadership choices are having on the world around you? We find that many leaders we speak with, given a moment to think over these questions, recognize their organizations to be actively perpetuating, or tolerating, societal inequities. We also find that they can fan sparks of activism in many leaders who long to initiate real positive change in the world.

Leadership & Managing people Making the Hybrid Workplace Fair New working arrangements will create new power dynamics. Here’s how managers can prepare. by Mark Mortensen and Martine Haas by Mark Mortensen and Martine Haas February 24, 2021 Illustration by Jason Schneider Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Thanks to the benefits for both employers and employees, hybrid work arrangements will likely persist beyond the pandemic. In order for them to work, though, leaders must understand the power differentials they create within teams and take steps to level the playing field. Where individuals (including the manager) on a team are located relative to others matters, as does each individual’s skills in relationship building. The authors offer four strategies managers can take to manage the structurally inevitable differences in power that arise in a hybrid environment. Not doing so can damage relationships, impede effective collaboration, and ultimately reduce performance. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español The pandemic has upended much about how we work, and what comes next is neither the death of the office nor a return to the way things were. Instead, our new reality will be hybridity: working with employees who are co-located in the same physical space as well as employees working remotely. Hybridity promises organizations the benefits of remote working (increased flexibility, reduced carbon footprint, labor-cost optimization, and increased employee satisfaction) alongside the critical strengths of traditional, co-located work (smoother coordination, informal networking, stronger cultural socialization, greater creativity, and face-to-face collaboration). But hybridity is also inextricably tied to power — it creates power differentials within teams that can damage relationships, impede effective collaboration, and ultimately reduce performance. To lead effectively in a hybrid environment, managers must recognize and actively manage the two distinct sources of power that can impede — or facilitate — hybrid work: hybridity positioning and hybridity competence. How Hybridity Positioning Affects Power First, hybridity means that, due to where they’re positioned, employees have different access to resources and different levels of visibility — both key sources of power and influence. Resource access differs depending on whether the employee is located in the office or outside of it. Employees in the office have ready and quick access to technology and infrastructure to support their work. They tend to have faster and easier access to information, and that information tends to be more current and broad (including informal water-cooler conversations), which provides them with an edge when it comes to the rapid changes of today’s environment. Being in the office also provides access to the emotional and task-based social support provided by peers. Insight Center Collection Keeping Your Workforce Up and Running Adapt fast amid constant change. In contrast, employees who work remotely often find their weaker technological setup and infrastructure (slow connections, inability to access certain resources from home, a less sophisticated home office setup) makes it more difficult to demonstrate their competence. Not being present for informal interactions leaves remote workers feeling out of the loop and last to know. Being remote may also lead employees to feel more isolated and lacking the relationships and connections that provide social support. Visibility level, or being seen by those in power, is also shaped by an employee’s location — especially their location relative to their boss and senior managers. Working in the same space as the boss increases the likelihood that employees’ efforts and actions will be recognized and top of mind. Employees who are seen in the hallways are likely to come to mind when it’s time to staff an important new project, and their actions on that project are likely to be recognized, resulting in credit for a job well done. Even if the boss is working remotely, when an employee is based in the office, it increases the likelihood that their actions will be seen by others and reported to the boss indirectly. When working remotely, no one sees the late nights or early mornings or how hard employees are working to deliver on their obligations. Credit for a collective output is likely to be unevenly attributed most to those who are there in the office and more visible. Taking these two dimensions of hybridity positioning together, we can understand how hybridity affects each employee in a team or work group by thinking in terms of where the employee and manager are situated. How Hybridity Competence Affects Power Not all individuals are equally skilled at operating within a hybrid environment. The ability to effectively navigate in a hybrid environment is itself a skill and therefore a source of power. Hybridity requires employees to be ambidextrous — able to balance between and navigate across both worlds — in a way that fully co-located or fully remote working don’t. Employees who are strong at relationship building, both face-to-face and virtually, have an advantage in hybrid environments, as do those who are willing to ask for, find, and claim the resources they may not have easy access to. Employees with good network and political awareness are able to recognize advantageous positions and situations, and those who establish strong relationships that can transcend the gap between face-to-face and remote working can use informal connections to replace missing information. Hybrid environments reward employees who think and act adaptably and flexibly, who are able to organize and coordinate across a complex and dynamic environment, and who are able to establish and provide evidence of their own trustworthiness when working in a context of low visibility. On the other hand, employees who are less effective at building relationships in either in-person or remote environments may find themselves struggling to work with collaborators who do work that way. Those who are less skilled at coordinating work within such a complex system may find they’re constantly out of sync with colleagues and managers. Hybridity competence is a separate source of power from hybridity positioning. Someone in a disadvantaged position may still be able to work very effectively if they have high hybridity competence, while someone in an advantaged position may still be ineffective if they have low hybridity competence. The Managerial Challenge While employees need to ensure that they’re visible to their managers and can access the resources they need for their work, managers similarly need to make sure they stay informed about what their employees are doing and facilitate their access to those resources. Managers who are co-located with their employees have more information about what and how those employees are doing. Managers who are remote from their employees may feel like they’re operating in the dark. Incomplete information is nothing new, but hybridity’s real threat is to fairness. Here are four ways managers can actively manage the structurally inevitable differences in power that arise in a hybrid environment and their effects. Track and communicate. Create an accurate map of your team’s “hybridity configuration”: who is working where, and when. Once you’ve mapped this out, you need to have a conversation with them to surface the challenges they and you face and discuss what you can do to overcome them. Always bear in mind that your employees’ resource access depends on their location, and their visibility depends on their location relative to you. Making this task more complex is that hybridity is itself dynamic — a result of variations both across employees (“Martine works in the office, Mark works from home”) and for individual employees (“I work in the office MWF and at home TT”). This makes hybridity a moving target. It requires ongoing systematic tracking, codifying, and visualizing to help both managers and employees stay aware of the configuration of hybridity in a given work group and manage the resulting power dynamics. Design. While some level of power imbalance is structurally inevitable in a hybrid team or work group, when necessary and possible, managers should intervene to redistribute power through shifting access to resources and/or visibility levels. At the same time, policies and procedures should be revisited regularly to ensure they don’t provide an unfair advantage based on hybridity — for example, KPIs that don’t align with resource accessibility, or evaluations that don’t account for differences in visibility levels. Educate. Many of these issues arise not solely from hybridity itself, but from a lack of awareness of the power imbalances it creates. To effectively manage in hybrid environments, managers must promote awareness of the issues and educate employees (and themselves) on how to avoid bias. Particularly important is establishing a culture of psychological safety and (individual/collective) trust. This will increase the likelihood of employees speaking up and asking for resources when they need them, as well as their confidence that their efforts will be recognized. Monitor. With this understanding in mind, it’s important that managers keep an eye out for key intervention moments. Through our discussions with executives, we’ve identified a number of key opportunities to address the potential challenges of hybridity for power dynamics within their teams: Performance reviews and evaluations. Managers must remain acutely aware of how hybridity creates an imbalance in their teams with respect to employees’ access to resources and visibility levels, as well as the information that they hold about their employees. Reviews present an opportunity for managers and employees to review and discuss imbalances and how to address them going forward. Team launches. Hybrid teams start with team members who are not on the same footing. Team launches are an opportunity for managers and team members to recognize, acknowledge, and discuss power differences and to decide how collectively to manage them. Onboarding. How can managers bring people into the organization when not everyone can physically come to the office? How can they put their new remote hires on a comparable footing to those who are brought into a face-to-face office environment? Hybridity’s impacts on group dynamics need to be incorporated into onboarding sessions and discussions in order to ensure new employees recognize the importance of consciously managing hybridity-based sources of power. For companies to reap the many benefits of hybrid working, managers must be aware of the power dynamics at play. It’s critical that they develop an understanding of hybridity positioning and hybridity competence and take steps to level the playing field for their teams.

The first time you test your plan shouldn’t be during a crisis. by Keri Pearlson, Brett Thorson, Stuart Madnick, and Michael Coden by Keri Pearlson, Brett Thorson, Stuart Madnick, and Michael Coden March 09, 2021 Illustration by María Medem Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Preparing for the unexpected is much easier said than done. In the case of cyberattacks, many companies have vulnerabilities in their defenses and reactions they haven’t prepared for that hackers will test. Many organizations can benefit from instituting fire drills and tabletop exercises, which test a company’s response plan at every level. These exercises will almost certainly reveal gaps in security, response plans, and employees’ familiarity with their own roles. While investing in external facilitators for these exercises will often allow for a more rigorous test separate from internal dynamics, there is guidance for organizations who wish to execute internal exercises to better prepare for a cyberattack. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Cyberattacks always happen when you least expect them. And when they happen, they happen quickly. Responding appropriately is not just the responsibility of your cybersecurity team; everyone in the organization has a role to play. Is your team prepared? Do they know what to do and what not to do? Most importantly, has your whole team practiced their response? Everyone — the board of directors, company executives, managers, and team members — has to know their roles and responsibilities and work out any potential problems with their response before a live cyberattack puts immense stress on the organization. There’s an easy way to determine whether your incident response plan (IRP) works and whether your team knows their roles: a test. Yet a Ponemon survey determined that 47% of organizations have not assessed the readiness of their incident response teams, meaning that the first time they test their plans will be at the worst possible time — in the middle of a cyberattack. Hackers constantly and consistently test your defenses and reactions. You must do the same. In our work helping organizations — both public and private, large and small, domestic and international — plan for cyberattacks, we’ve found that fire drills and table top exercises (TTXs) are a great way to prepare for the worst. Fire Drills and Table Top Exercises Think of an emergency room scenario following a car accident. When seriously injured patients arrive, the ER staff has to know exactly what to do and how to do it. They cannot be learning at the same time the crisis is happening. The same goes for C-suite executives and top management. To make sure they are aligned and aware of company plans during a cyberattack, they need to practice ahead of time and build muscle memory in how to respond. Simulated scenarios help organizations to validate their plans and prepare company leaders. An effective engagement takes a few weeks of planning, and works best when realistic situations and scenarios are used. We usually create videos simulating the company being criticized on the evening news, have journalists show up and demand to interview the CEO, or interrupt a press conference to ask about the cyberattack. We have simulated dark websites where executives can see their most valuable intellectual property being auctioned to the highest bidder, and their stock price dropping like a rock. The first step is to make sure there are clear learning objectives and to determine which cyberattack consequences will have a serious negative impact to the organization. Fire drills and TTXs help organizations identify vulnerabilities and risks that need to be addressed, demonstrate to the organization the magnitude of the risk and the importance of security resources and investment, and test plans in a way that helps everyone be ready. It’s almost a certainty that something unanticipated will occur. Knowing what to do helps executives respond when the unexpected actually happens. Each test serves a different purpose. TTXs are occasional and test managerial capability and team-level response; fire drills are regular exercises that test people, processes, and technologies to make sure they respond appropriately and that there are contingency plans in place in the event that first-line responses don’t work. If the digital systems that support the organization are compromised, it is critical to have alternative communication plans, operational plans, back ups, and emergency resources identified that can back-fill until normal processes and systems can be restored. Without these tests, companies are left vulnerable to whatever might be thought of in the moment when their main systems are compromised, and that can result in major business disruption such as was experienced recently by Santander Bank, the City of Baltimore, and just recently, the U.S. Treasury. The 4 Most Effective Fire Drills and TTXs So where should you start? It depends on who and what you want to test. We have found four types of fire drills and table top exercises to be the most effective. Target audience Type and objective of exercise Motivation Approximate length of exercise Board of directors TTX: education and awareness Boards need to know what the company will do in the event of a cyber emergency. 1–2 hours C-suite TTX: crisis management C-level executives need to have plans for crisis management so that they know immediately what to do and whom to contact. 2–4 hours Organization Fire drill: test and practice incident response and business continuity plans Detailed drills build organizational confidence and strength to respond quickly and effectively throughout the company. Especially useful for the cybercrisis management team. A few hours to multiple days Technical team Fire drill: technical response planning Testing on a regular basis ensures that detection systems, technology backups, and contingency plans are in place and working and that the tech team knows what to do and how to do it. Continuous, with a full fire drill at least quarterly © HBR.org Each approach listed above tests a different part of a company’s plans. A TTX for your C-level team will help them practice the current company response plan and test alternative contingencies should the unexpected happen. A TTX for your board provides a similar opportunity. Ultimately TTXs and fire drills drive awareness and build values, attitudes, and beliefs around the importance of everyone participating in keeping the organization secure. Importantly, each test helps companies find out what about their plan isn’t going to work — and gives them time to fix it before they need to put it into action. What Your Organization Will Likely Discover A good TTX immerses participants in a cyberattack so they can feel the effects of the decisions they make and the effectiveness of the company plans. Most organizations discover something about their plans that previously had not been obvious, such as: Flawed and unmanageable plans: One manufacturing company realized their incident response plan was 400 pages long and no one had ever read it. When your shareholders and the press are clogging your switchboard asking for information, your employees are not sure what to do, and the cybercriminal is exfiltrating gigabytes of data or encrypting your computers so the employees cannot work, that is not the time for each executive to read a 400 page document — of which only 5-6 pages may apply to them — to determine what actions to take. Knowing who to call: In another exercise, the first line solution to the crisis was that “someone will call Pat who will handle that by checking this software.” However, only one person knew Pat, Pat didn’t know it was their responsibility, and the software didn’t really work as the person assumed. It’s this level of detail that maximizes the value of the exercise. New unanticipated risks: At other times, these tests can make companies aware of risks they had never considered — let alone planned for. In 2018, we conducted several TTXs where the scenario included several physical locations of an organization being uninhabitable, and the organization had to move to an all-work-from-home scenario. We unwittingly prepared these organizations for the reality of the current Covid-19 situation (though some at the time didn’t believe there was a situation in which this could occur). Impacts beyond business continuity: A TTX is a useful tool to highlight impacts beyond business continuity. In a very large financial institution, we created an exercise with a scenario that caused customers to lose confidence in doing business with the organization. One of the C-suite executives stopped the exercise in the middle and responded, “You realize that he [the TTX facilitator pretending to be a cyber criminal] just destroyed our company with one plausible scenario! We need to invest more in cybersecurity.” Motivation to invest in cybersecurity: In a recent study by Osterman Research, 45% of respondents said that following a TTX, they were able to increase their security budgets. Most of this budget was spent on procuring additional solutions and training their workforce. This same study highlighted that 78% of cybersecurity professionals believed that their TTXs and fire drills had better prepared their organizations to respond to future cyber threats. What Should Your Organization Do Next? Using an external source to create and conduct a fire drill or TTX can increase the benefits. Internally designed exercises often lack the level of surprise and unexpected scenarios and interventions. After creating the response plans, internal team members have a difficult time envisioning something unexpected. Further, team members may have difficulty challenging their peers and senior executives, resulting in groupthink or letting the team off the hook rather than challenging their responses and ideas. External leaders don’t have the same assumptions and don’t come to the table with the organization’s institutional memory and habits. Pressing for details and discovering flaws in plans can be career limiting for an insider, but it’s expected and necessary for an effective exercise. That said, while there are benefits to bringing in outsiders (and we’d argue that it’s worth the cost), companies can organize these tests on their own. Here are a few best practices for creating and conducting your own exercises: Get the right people in the room. Schedule sessions far in advance and let the executives know they are mandatory. Getting everyone in the same room or Zoom call for the same 2-4 hours can be challenging. Build a likely scenario timeline for your organization and share information carefully. Pick a cyberattack that seems plausible for your type of organization, since an exercise close to a real situation your team might encounter will be more engaging. Decide if the cyberattack will take place over hours, days, or weeks, and make sure you communicate how you may be speeding time up during the exercise. Real attacks happen over time, so the unfolding of events is important to the exercise. At each point on the timeline, the participants must make the best decision they can with the information they have. Do not give the participants all the information they would like to have at any given time. This helps them to realize what they need to know in a real incident. Create the scenario so every member of the team has a role to play. It’s very easy to tell someone else what they should do, but sometimes it’s hard to hear or think up what you should do. Response plans often have activities for specific roles (what the CEO should do, what the CIO should do, what the CHRO role should do, etc.). If possible, share the full organizational response plan with the team ahead of time so they know it exists (and hopefully they read it). Create an abbreviated version, customized for each participant, that contains only that participant’s roles and responsibilities to help them be as prepared as possible. Discuss action plans at each pause of the timeline. After telling the participants a piece of the scenario, give them a chance to discuss what they would suggest doing. Ask them if what they are doing conforms to the company incident response plan or if they are improvising. If they are improvising — is it because the plan is not satisfactory and should be improved? Be sure to have someone taking notes so ideas from these discussions are not lost. Practice before the full team exercise. The best exercises have been well thought out and test the organization’s current response plans and improvisions. Prepare for this by running a short practice TTX one-on-one with each executive in the privacy of their office or a private call. Walk them through their role as described in the current response plan. This will avoid a situation where an executive does not participate in the group exercise because they are afraid to embarrass themselves. While this can be a powerful force for change, it often backfires and results in finger-pointing, leaving the room, or other emotionally-charged behavior. Companies who conduct fire drills and table top exercises report that they are both better prepared for a cyber crisis and more cohesive as a team in the face of an emergency. The cost benefit of TTX can be realized quickly — and the result is an increase in the agility and quality of a response which could reduce the financial impact to an organization by millions. It’s time to schedule your team’s practice sessions.

Leadership & Managing people Staying Mindful When You’re Working Remotely Don’t just be online — be present. by Alyson Meister and Amanda Sinclair by Alyson Meister and Amanda Sinclair March 16, 2021 HBR Staff Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Remote work is taking its toll in the form of chronic stress and burnout. Cultivating mindfulness in our online environment is a way to combat this depletion of energy. The authors recommend applying three mindfulness principles to your remote work to reduce stress levels and reconnect with your purpose. First, offer your team your presence by eliminating distractions and focusing on how you’re being with the people you’re speaking to. Next, be in the moment by focusing on where you are now, rather than thinking about the future. Finally, enable connection and community by practicing deep listening and paying close attention to inclusion. Remote working doesn’t have to be a barrier to your capacity to deliver leadership presence, empathize and connect with colleagues, and build strong workplace communities. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español It’s no surprise that online work is depleting our energy and resilience. The evidence shows that many of us are working longer hours, suffering chronic stress, and burning out at levels the world has never witnessed. At the same time, we’re longing for and losing our social connections and sometimes experiencing profound loneliness and grief in solitude. To regain energy, find renewed pleasure in our work, and truly connect with colleagues and friends, we need to find ways to block out the noise in our virtual reality. One way we can do that is through cultivating mindfulness — online. Mindfulness is the choice we make to be present in the here and now: This moment, in this meeting, with this person or group of people. Research shows that most activities of our working lives, from working on an independent task to team meetings and one on ones, benefit from being conducted with mindfulness. By pausing, checking in with others, or starting meetings with a few moments of meditation or reflection, stress levels drop and we feel more connected to our purpose and to others in the room. We listen better and feel happier. But how can we be mindful in an online working world? How can we be truly present for others when we couldn’t be (physically) farther from one another? What we learned from 2020 is that online and remote working doesn’t have to be a barrier to our capacity to deliver leadership presence, empathize and connect with colleagues, and build strong workplace communities. Contrary to popular misconceptions, you don’t have to retreat to a mountain top or a meditation cushion to practice mindfulness. You can do it while working from home by: Pausing and noticing where your thinking mind is Purposefully bringing your awareness to the people and context that are with you virtually Suspending your own narratives, agendas, judgements, and ego to offer your full online presence, evidenced through eye contact, warm and responsive facial expressions, and minimized multitasking You can apply these three principles of mindfulness to managing and leading online. From doing to being: Offer your presence. Action is the hallmark of managers. It’s what they’re noticed for and measured on: Doing, achieving, producing, organizing, controlling. New remote and hybrid working environments have thrust managers into excessive patterns of “doing.” But sometimes, who and how you’re being can be more important than your actions. To cultivate trust and motivate and inspire others, pay attention to how you’re being with them. Are you rushed or distracted? Is your mind on the next meeting or your to-do list? To enhance the quality of your leadership presence with others, take a moment to reflect on your physical and emotional state when entering a new meeting. Through your virtual presence, what energy will you convey to this set of colleagues or clients? Will you bring the tough conversation you just had with someone else into this new one? Will you offer a sense of calm and reassurance? Another’s presence (or lack thereof) is noticeable. When someone is speaking, are you using the moment to check your email, send a text, or schedule a meeting? You may think that none of this shows in online working contexts. But just as in a face-to-face meeting room, virtual participants know whether and how you’re truly present with them — emotions and attention can be broadcast, felt, and contagious across virtual boundaries. Even in a big online town hall, the audience can sense if the speaker is truly with them, and the speaker knows if most of the audience is elsewhere. Lead by example when working remotely. Try to have your camera on and ask others to do so if possible. Ensure others can feel your presence by establishing eye contact, and use your body and posture to convey interest and empathy. If you know you just can’t help but look, turn off those enticing email notifications. Shifting your focus to how you’re being doesn’t mean that things don’t get done. And none of these shifts in your awareness and attention take more than a few moments. But they do have impact on you and on those you’re working with. From future to present: Be here, now. Managers are taught to relentlessly plan for the future. Yet always having your mind on next month’s targets or next year’s profits can mean you miss life today. You forgo important opportunities for connection and empowering others if you’re in your mind, planning “the next step” or worrying about something that might not happen. Take a moment to step back from the busy-ness and view your tasks with perspective — looking down from the balcony. What or who is important right now? Ask yourself: Am I postponing life, thinking that all the good stuff will come next month, next year, or when lockdowns and pandemic restrictions end? Postponing life can exacerbate unhappiness and stress. We hold out for when things will improve but don’t see all the beautiful small things around us now: A fun meal with family, a morning walk or run, the sharing of a special moment or a celebration with colleagues. Next time you’re in a virtual meeting and notice your mind has wandered off, catch yourself. Bring your mind to where your body actually is — this present moment, right here, right now. Take a few seconds to anchor your awareness in the now by drawing on your senses. Look outside if you can, and take in any sky or green that may be visible. Relax your shoulders and your jaw. Breathe out. These momentary connections with your physical senses are the gateways to being more present. Sharing some words of gratitude for people showing up and for what exists in the here and now can help others to pause and pay attention. They may notice they’ve been ruminating and can choose to tune in, not tune out. Practicing mindfulness techniques like these has been demonstrated to lift moods, foster well-being, and improve overall psychological health. From me to you: Enabling connection and community. When people are talking, where is your mind? Is it with them? Or are you waiting for a gap to jump in with your opinion or experience? Can you suspend your own agendas and ego needs to hear what people on the team need? Try deepening your listening. Try listening without wanting to “fix” people or (perhaps silently) insisting they get over things. Deep listening is generous. Encourage the person speaking to discover and voice a way forward. They will appreciate and be empowered by it, finding their own path or solution. In our executive development work, we have found that virtual meetings can reduce barriers for people to speak and to have their voice and presence heard and felt. For example, tools like “raise hand” indicators and simultaneous chat functions enable different ways for people to offer insight and signal their contribution. Further, that everyone has one equal-sized window with only a headshot in a virtual meeting can diminish stereotypes, hierarchies, and power differentials as certain physical and status markers are removed. As a mindful leader, be aware of who is present, and pay particular attention to inclusion. Welcome and seek people’s input, especially from those who usually don’t say much. Endorsing expressions of openness and vulnerability can help cultivate a culture of appreciation and psychological safety. As a leader, you might offer some vulnerability about where you are right now, which will open the space for others to express how they really are. You might be juggling the needs of a sick child or a parent in aged care. The circumstances of online working have sometimes meant we’ve had to get more real. People are tuning in from their living rooms and bedrooms. They have families, pets, and other competing needs to accommodate. We’ve had to take off our office masks, our make-up, and our constructed work identities and allow others to see us more fully. This has surely been a good thing.

Peter Greenwood/Folio Art Managing people The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis Beyond Burned Out Chronic stress was rampant even before the pandemic. Leaders can’t ignore it any longer. by Jennifer Moss by Jennifer Moss February 10, 2021 · Long read The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis 01 Beyond Burned Out 02 What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts 03 How the Pandemic Exacerbated Burnout 04 Six Lessons on Fighting Burnout from Boston’s Biggest Hospital 05 How to Beat Loneliness — and Make Friends — at Work 06 What I Learned When I Was Burned Out Summary. In our always-on world, burnout has long been a threat. But in 2020 burnout became rampant, seemingly overnight. Within weeks millions of people lost their jobs and faced financial and food insecurity. People working on the front lines worried for their physical safety, and those in health care put their lives at risk every day. A third of U.S. employees started “living at work” — with the kitchen table as their new pseudo-office. Over the year acute stress would become chronic stress. And it shows few signs of abating. Today’s level of burnout is the result of an existing problem made exponentially worse. Yet despite how massive the problem is, it’s never too late to fix it. Combating burnout may feel like an overwhelming and herculean task, especially after months of emotional fatigue, but if you’re armed with the right tools, it can be easier than you might think. And ready or not, we can’t ignore the urgency — we are in the midst of a burnout epidemic. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print When the Covid-19 pandemic began, I felt as if I were in one of those disaster movies, standing in front of a rapidly spreading fire as an entire city was about to be engulfed in flames. And despite feeling that a massive disruption was imminent, I could only watch in shock. I’ve studied burnout and worked with organizations to address it for years, but nothing would inform my understanding of the topic more than living through 2020. For some time I’d been sounding the alarm: “Burnout is getting worse. People are sick!” Then we were all suddenly thrust into unknown territory: By April 2.6 billion people had gone into lockdown, and places of employment for 81% of the global workforce were fully or partially closed. A huge percentage of knowledge workers began doing their jobs from home — many collaborating on Zoom, whose daily active users skyrocketed from 10 million to 200 million. This sudden shift did what little else had been able to accomplish before: expose how thinly stretched and worn down we all were — and had been for a while. And it also made our burnout much, much worse. Just How Bad Is Burnout? Jennifer Moss is a workplace expert, international public speaker, and award-winning journalist. She is the bestselling author of Unlocking Happiness at Work (Kogan Page, 2021) and the forthcoming book The Burnout Epidemic (HBR Press, September 2021). Although the concept of occupational burnout originated in the 1970s, the medical community has long argued about how to define it. In 2019 the World Health Organization finally included burnout in its International Classification of Diseases, describing it as “a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” This language acknowledged that burnout is more than just an employee problem; it’s an organizational problem that requires an organizational solution. When you analyze the real causes of burnout, it becomes clear that almost everyone has been attacking the problem from the wrong angle. According to Christina Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, Susan E. Jackson of Rutgers, and Michael Leiter of Deakin University, burnout has six main causes: Unsustainable workload Perceived lack of control Insufficient rewards for effort Lack of a supportive community Lack of fairness Mismatched values and skills While these are all organizational issues, we still prescribe self-care as the cure for burnout. We’ve put the burden of solving the problem squarely on the shoulders of individual employees. “Let’s just recommend more yoga, wellness tech, meditation apps, and subsidized gym memberships — that’ll fix it,” we say. But those are tools for improving well-being. When it comes to preventing burnout specifically, they won’t be effective. We desperately need upstream interventions, not downstream tactics. In this article I’ll describe tactics companies can use to address some of the organizational roots of burnout. The Burnout Crisis: Get the reprint download PDF buy copies Teaming up together, Leiter, Maslach, and David Whiteside, the director of insights and research at YMCA WorkWell, and I created a survey that analyzes the state of burnout and well-being during Covid-19. We combined several evidence-based scales, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS), a psychological assessment of occupational burnout, and the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS), which assesses employees’ perceptions of work-setting qualities that affect whether they experience engagement or burnout. With support from Harvard Business Review, we gathered feedback from more than 1,500 respondents in 46 countries, in various sectors, roles, and seniority levels, in the fall of 2020. Sixty-seven percent of respondents worked at or above a supervisor level. What did we learn, in a nutshell? Burnout is a global problem. Some stats: 89% of respondents said their work life was getting worse. 85% said their well-being had declined. 56% said their job demands had increased. 62% of the people who were struggling to manage their workloads had experienced burnout “often” or “extremely often” in the previous three months. 57% of employees felt that the pandemic had a “large effect on” or “completely dominated” their work. 55% of all respondents didn’t feel that they had been able to balance their home and work life — with 53% specifically citing homeschooling. 25% felt unable to maintain a strong connection with family, 39% with colleagues, and 50% with friends. Only 21% rated their well-being as “good,” and a mere 2% rated it as “excellent.” The 1,500 people in our survey not only much more squarely fit the burnout profile than did the nearly 50,000 respondents who had taken the MBI-GS before the pandemic, they also scored very high on exhaustion and cynicism — two predictors of burnout, according to the MBI-GS. “These survey responses make it clear that a lot of people are having serious disruptions in their relationship with work,” Leiter notes. “It’s not surprising that people are more exhausted — people are working hard to keep their work and personal lives afloat. But the rise in cynicism is even more troubling. Cynicism reflects a lack of trust in the world. So many people feel let down by their government’s poor preparation for the pandemic, as well as by the injustices in work and well-being that the pandemic has highlighted.” A primer on burnout from our partners at Ascend, a job and life advice channel for young professionals. Millennials have the highest levels of burnout, we found. Much of this is due to having less autonomy at work, lower seniority, and greater financial stressors and feelings of loneliness. The last was the biggest factor leading to burnout, according to our research. As one Millennial put it: “The pandemic has had a tremendous impact on my well-being — I’ve had mental health challenges, and I’ve hit major roadblocks with that. My physical health has changed because I can’t exercise like I used to. It’s affected me economically. I feel as though my career has been set back yet again.” How Did It Get This Bad? So, yes, burnout is severe today, but the seeds were planted before Covid-19 hit — even then, many workers were already experiencing high levels of it. The pandemic was simply an accelerant. Consider teachers. Pre-pandemic, they endured long hours and chronic underpay. Nurses and physicians, who have seen some of the most extreme cases of burnout, worked notoriously long shifts — often 16 hours or more, despite research showing that patient errors increase threefold when nurses (for example) work shifts lasting 12.5 hours or longer. In other sectors — such as technology — overwork is celebrated, even though research clearly shows that putting in more than 55 hours a week does nothing to improve job performance. For example, in 2018 Elon Musk tweeted the following in response to a Wall Street Journal article describing Tesla’s culture of long hours: “There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” What number of hours is needed to change the world? “About 80 sustained,” Musk tweeted. Former employees of Uber shared in 2017 that working until 1 or 2 AM was typical at the company, and a 2015 New York Times article about Amazon described “marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access while on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.” It didn’t help matters that during the pandemic we misdiagnosed the resulting stress as acute rather than chronic. And once it was clear that the crisis was a triathlon, not a sprint or even a marathon, organizations did very little to help employees over the long term in meaningful ways, abandoning or failing to adapt their initial efforts. In the first weeks of the pandemic, most organizations were expecting it to end quickly. Remote workers were given a return-by date of one month. Then another month. Then in May big tech companies like Facebook and Google extended working from home to the end of the year. (They have since extended it well into 2021.) In the meantime people were left to figure out their new WFH arrangements largely on their own. We also saw a surge in “well-being by video,” as leaders scrambled to figure out how to replace the at-work experience with a virtual one. Team building now included Zoom happy hours and morning stretch sessions. In the first few weeks these virtual events were jam-packed, but within a month well-being measures just became part of the staff’s workload and there was no “happy” left in online social hours. Several large-chain grocery stores in Canada and the United States chose to give their frontline workers “hero pay,” only to claw it back after a few months. (Some retailers are restoring it, but many have abandoned the policy.) In the spring, physicians, nurses, and first responders were celebrated with parades and applause. Over time the cheers stopped. The applause faded at the worst possible time — when health care workers needed it most. They already had the highest rates of burnout, but the pandemic took them to unprecedented levels. It’s understandable that we might not have recognized the true impact of the pandemic at first. So much was unknown. But once we realized we were in it for the long haul, we could have slowed down and analyzed what was working and what wasn’t. We could have been more creative about changing practices to ease burnout. But we didn’t. Instead of pumping the brakes when the virus spread and acute stress began to become chronic, we made things worse in these key areas: We didn’t adjust workloads. Overwork was the most-cited reason for burnout and decreased well-being in our pre-pandemic qualitative research. Research from Gallup has shown that the risk of occupational burnout increases significantly when an employee’s workweek averages more than 50 hours, and rises even more substantially at 60 hours. Clearly, this issue has not gone away. If anything, the pandemic has probably exacerbated it. One respondent to our recent survey shared, “Everything seems like a rush. There’s more pressure to produce, and no one respects time boundaries. Emails start at 5:30 AM and don’t end until 10 PM, because they know you have nowhere else to go. For single people with no families, it’s worse, because you don’t get to say, ‘I need to go take care of my kids.’” We didn’t give people control and flexibility. The pandemic brought employees a host of new challenges. Childcare options were limited, with day care centers and schools closed and grandparents separated from their extended families. Parents were grappling with homeschooling children while working from home — with the whole family on the same Wi-Fi connection — and dealing with increased household chores resulting from suddenly having everyone under the same roof 24/7. Some organizations saw the value of allowing employees more flexibility, but too many did not. I suspect this stems from the way the notion of flexibility has long been steeped in bias, with some considering it “a mother’s benefit.” The lockdown tested that idea, but in the end the existing systemic failures of workplace policies and biases about women proved disastrous. Gains for women would be lost, with serious consequences. According to the Center for American Progress, “four times as many women as men dropped out of the labor force in September, roughly 865,000 women compared with 216,000 men.” Black, Latinx, and Indigenous women are experiencing this most acutely because of “the multiple effects of being more likely to have lost their jobs, being on the front lines as essential workers, and solving their childcare challenges on their own.” “There’s no respite from work,” shared one woman in our survey. “I work 9 to 9 almost every day. My husband is working in the office, and I’m working from the kitchen counter, with the baby in the living room. I don’t get time to focus on anything. If I’m spending five minutes with my son, my instant messages are blowing up (and I hear the noise). If I’m working with my back to my son, I’m constantly turning around to check on him.” The impact of the disruption to women’s ability to work is enormous. Even a 5% decline in maternal labor force participation would set women back 25 years, according to the report. We allowed more meetings and unhealthful levels of screen time. We talk about Zoom burnout as if it’s a new thing. In reality, it’s just a new manifestation of a bad workplace practice on overdrive. We’ve had meeting fatigue forever. According to Steven Rogelberg of UNC Charlotte, who wrote The Surprising Science of Meetings, pre-Covid-19 studies showed that about 55 million meetings a day were held in the United States alone and that U.S. organizations wasted $37 billion annually because most meetings were unproductive. Despite all that, meetings increased substantially during the pandemic. According to a recent study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research that analyzed the data on more than 3 million people, the amount of time employees spend in meetings has increased by 13%. In addition the average workday is now 48 minutes longer. What’s especially troubling here is that video calls are actually harder on us physically and mentally. Our brains find it more challenging to process nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language on them, making it tough to relax during conversations. Plus, slight delays in verbal responses subconsciously make us dislike people, according to research cited by Jena Lee, an attending psychiatrist and assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “I sit all day. My ankles were swelling at one point, and I had to sleep with my feet elevated. I don’t sleep well. I have no time to do anything I enjoy,” one of our survey respondents told us. “I go from one Webex or Teams meeting to the next.” We didn’t recognize the extent of people’s struggles. Burnout, when experienced in the extreme, can be tragic. That’s what Corey Feist, who is outspoken on the topic of physician burnout, emphasized to me in the wake of his sister-in-law’s suicide last April. Dr. Lorna Breen was the medical director of the emergency department at a hospital in Manhattan. She was working on the front lines, deep into the first surge of a locked-down New York City as the virus raged through it. Feist remembers Breen describing the hospital as “Armageddon.” Peter Greenwood/Folio Art The factors that played a role in her burnout, according to Feist, are multifold. “First she contracted Covid-19 and was exhausted, depleted, and probably dealing with the brain fog that we now know impacts people with the virus. Then she went back into the workforce way too fast. On top of still being sick and exhausted, she would now face a volume of death and dying that she’d never seen before. Add in feelings around not being able to contribute and not being able to take care of your patients — because they were dying, and doctors are trained to fix people — and it was all so overwhelming.” Not every case is as distressing as Breen’s. But her story points to a key truth: One big problem of the pandemic is that we simply haven’t realized — much less acknowledged — how hard circumstances are. And we’ve been applying Band-Aid solutions to a gaping wound in the form of yoga programs, wellness technology, and meditation apps. The need to recognize that people are working unsustainably day after day, that they may not feel safe talking about their mental health, and that they’re overwhelmed and exhausted is urgent. There is no app to fix that. And the vast majority of senior leaders have told us that they’re tired, too — and tired of leading tired people. This global pandemic is not “business as usual,” so we need to stop acting as if it is. How to Beat Burnout There are some easy things we can all do to combat burnout, most critically at the organizational level. There was good news in our research, and it illuminated where we need to focus. Factors that predicted lower levels of burnout included the following: Feeling a sense of purpose. Respondents said that this feeling helped defend against burnout at work. In fact, burnout scores declined as purpose scores increased: Twenty-five percent of people who felt a strong sense of purpose in their work had not experienced any burnout (according to both self-reporting and the MBI-GS) in the previous three months. However, since the data reflects knowledge-worker sentiment, I wouldn’t want to suggest that employees on the front lines or first responders should rely on purpose to prevent burnout. This finding requires more analysis, but my colleagues and I found it to be an important insight. Having a manageable workload. This was one of the strongest predictors of lower burnout. To help overburdened employees, organizations should communicate more about priorities and about what can be put on the back burner until time permits (or perhaps forever). One of the most glaring issues related to workload was meeting fatigue — it tops the list of things organizations must tackle. To begin to address it, use this simple formula: Ask, Is this meeting necessary? If yes, then ask: Does it have to be a video call? Does it have to be longer than 30 minutes? Which attendees are absolutely essential? Can we turn off our cameras and use our photos or avatars instead? Can we do an audio-only conference call for a much-needed screen break? Start meetings with a check-in: How are people feeling? Does anyone have a back-to-back call? If you’re leading the meeting, set a timer so you can let anyone who does have one jump off five to 10 minutes early. Feeling that you can discuss your mental health at work. Our survey found that nearly half of respondents don’t believe they can openly do this — and 65% of those people experienced burnout “often or always.” That is a massive problem. The first step toward solving it is to create a culture of psychological safety at work, which Harvard Business School’s Amy Edmondson, who is an expert on the topic, defines as “a climate in which people are comfortable being (and expressing) themselves.” For example, when someone messes up, we may get angry. Yes, we all have a right to be frustrated, but whom does that serve? The bigger goal is to set things right. Edmondson suggests that more-productive responses start with asking about what help is required to get back on track. That is, after all, what we really care about. When this kind of communication is common, people generally feel safer talking about more-personal topics, like mental health. Another tactic is to offer employees access to mental health support. That could include: A mental health resource page listing local outreach programs and mental health practitioners that are cause- or crisis-specific. Reduced hours, flexible hours, or even paid time off for anyone who has mental or physical health concerns — or who is caring for a loved one affected by the crisis. We were dramatically caught off guard by the pandemic. This can’t happen again — time off and grief policies should be readied now. A peer-to-peer outreach program. Firms can select leaders to train in mental health 101, who can then be activated as a support system for the staff in a crisis. Having managers check in on their direct reports immediately. The pandemic was a jarring example of how quickly a crisis can escalate. If we have communication plans in place before disaster hits, we can provide answers to pressing issues. Just by asking more frequently “How are you doing?” and “How can I help?” we’ll demonstrate that the well-being of our team is a priority. Having an empathetic manager. This was the second-most-cited need in the survey, just slightly behind manageable workloads. And for good reason: According to Harvard Medical School’s Helen Riess, who is also the cofounder and chief scientist of Empathetics, communicating empathically increases job satisfaction, reduces burnout, and is highly correlated with enhanced well-being. It is perhaps the most critical skill in a crisis and something that we can all improve on. Empathetic leadership requires three things: acknowledging and overcoming any personal biases and privileges you might have; actively listening to your people; and taking action. I want to focus on the second — active listening — as something that’s particularly important today. It involves giving people a safe place to share and demonstrating that you’ve heard them by acting on their words. You can do this one-on-one or set up open forums through Slack or Teams or any other workplace social collaboration tool, where good ideas can proliferate. You may also want to create the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback; there are survey tools out there that make it easy to do that.

Another unique way to combat burnout is to become a “professional eavesdropper,” according to Martha Bird, a business anthropologist for the data processing company ADP. Why? Because it’s often the small things we say and do over time that account for the bigger picture on our well-being. “People are messy, and the messiness is what tells us the most,” she told me. “We humans attempt to make the mess meaningful. And that meaning is reflected in what we do.” Bird is suggesting that we need to look deeper than an occasional “How are you doing?” One study found that on average an adult will say “I’m fine” 14 times a week, though only 19% of people really mean it. Almost a third of the 2,000 people in our survey said that they often lie about how they’re feeling. By paying closer attention to what your employees are talking about and seeing patterns, you can spot and head off problems. So the next time people say they’re fine, ask again, “Are you really fine? It’s OK if you’re not. I’m here if you need to talk.” Having a strong sense of connection to family and friends. Our survey highlighted how many of us feel isolated. Before offices went virtual, one of the most healthful benefits of work was that it allowed us to establish and build friendships. That’s much more difficult, if not impossible, to do remotely. “I started this job six days before the pandemic meant that we had to work from home. I found it challenging to connect with new colleagues over Zoom calls,” one survey respondent wrote. “Even when I do go to the office, we are not allowed to meet in person. I think I have spent a total of about 10 hours face-to-face with my colleagues, and maybe 40 to 60 hours in Zoom meetings with them. It’s hardly enough to build trust and respect in a way that would feel meaningful to me.” Next In The Burnout Crisis What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts The pandemic has led to mental health declines, increased work demands, and feelings of loneliness. But the news isn’t all bad. Personally, I think some companies went too far too fast by making work from home a “forever” policy. Nearly three-quarters of employees want to have access to an office, according to a recent JLL survey of more than 2,000 employees across 10 countries. And 80% of high performers have missed their office greatly during lockdown, according to the same report. Flexible options are what workplace experts have long been arguing for. As soon as it is safe to do so, we need to create hybrid solutions that allow coworkers to connect and collaborate in person and virtually. Rich Barton, CEO of Zillow, has chosen to offer both work-from-home and in-office options. “The way our team delivered after we went remote turned my legacy opinion of working from home on its head and began a journey toward letting our people decide where they will thrive and be the most productive,” he told me. The best relationships are still built when we can see one another’s faces in person. The need to socially distance for almost a year now has taken a toll. So once the pandemic’s risks subside, leaders need to find ways to bring their teams back together in a physical space to connect in real life. Prepare Before the Next Crisis Of course, this is all just a starting point for how companies can address burnout. But the point I want to hammer home is this: Leaders, get the right systems in place now, before the next crisis happens. I’ve found that the companies that were already engaged in a burnout prevention strategy have been more successful at leading their workforce through the Covid-19 crisis. And I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the number of leaders who were deeply motivated to support their workforce. Here is one example that stood out for me. Alan May is the executive vice president and chief people officer for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). I spoke with May in October 2020, when nearly all the company’s 60,000 employees were working remotely. He believes HPE’s long-standing commitment to well-being has helped it weather the year’s challenges. “Crises tend to just accelerate underlying trends,” he observed. He hasn’t been creating wellness programs only in response to Covid-19; when it hit, the company was already two years into an internal campaign focused on them. Long before the pandemic, HPE was addressing burnout. One of the examples May shared was having “meetingless Fridays” to create “white space” for employees to work on ideating or reflecting. He also reinforced the importance of having frontline managers check in with employees regularly. While he’s not expecting those managers to be mental health experts, he shared that “in a number of cases, as a result of some of those interactions, we’ve detected some concerns, and we’ve been able to escalate them and get more professional help.” May also had created virtual social chat groups for peer-to-peer communication, where leaders could also actively engage, to bring together like-minded individuals with no real objectives. “We didn’t proctor the groups, but we did participate to some extent by listening,” said May. And when the crisis hit and “employees started sharing specific tips and tools for others working at home or specific suggestions for those that were homebound and lonely, it just became all about lifting up those good ideas and executing on them.” The resilience HPE employees appear to have built up seems to have served them well during the pandemic. According to the firm’s “Employee Work Experience Data” from July 2020: 91% of employees agreed that employee health and well-being was a top priority for HPE. 92% agreed that their direct leaders had shown genuine concern for their well-being. 91% agreed that their direct leaders had shown flexibility by allowing them to balance their personal and professional lives. Employee experience scores like these send an important message: “We feel supported. Keep it up.” If your organization also wants to foster great workplace experiences, well-being must be table stakes. Put mental health and burnout prevention protocols in place now. Prepare a communication strategy well in advance, so that when another crisis hits, information about support programs and details on any new health and safety measures can be shared instantly with employees. Keep in mind that poor communication during the Covid crisis has been a primary regret for more than a third of C-level leaders — and that 32% of employees surveyed claimed they yearned for more communication, done sooner and more transparently. . . . There is no quick fix for any of the burnout issues we’re facing, and sometimes that can feel paralyzing. We need to start small, or the task will seem too overwhelming. Big change starts with modest practical steps, working toward collective change. We can’t waste this crisis. The well-worn phrase “Knowing is half the battle” feels applicable here. If we can identify organizational signals of stress — because we are finally paying attention — then there is hope for the future. Leaders, we have endured a trial by fire, and there’s no turning back. We did not experience this crash course in emotional flexibility — this testing of our resilience — only to squander the learning. We have a shot at truly preventing burnout, and we can’t say that it’s too hard or too much work or that it requires too much change. The best moment to make a move is when everything is up for grabs. It’s time to turn the change that was inevitable into the change that was always possible. Starting right now.

Leadership Mindfulness Works but Only If You Work at It Give it at least 10 minutes a day. by Megan Reitz and Michael Chaskalson by Megan Reitz and Michael Chaskalson November 04, 2016 Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español The latest trend in leadership development is mindfulness training. There is a burgeoning array of apps, self-help books, and corporate interventions designed to help leaders become more mindful and thus more resilient, focused, and aware — qualities that many executives believe can make them more effective in their roles. Mindfulness — a way of paying attention with care and discernment to yourself, others, and the world around you — has been much researched. But although evidence from clinical contexts suggests that mindfulness provides many benefits, few studies have been conducted with business leaders. This means that basic questions have remained unanswered. For example, does mindfulness training actually improve leadership capacities? If it does, how? And how much effort do you need to make to achieve results? Trying to answer these and other important questions, we conducted the world’s first study of a multisession mindful leader program, which included a wait-list control group. Half of the participants received their training immediately and the other half received it later, but we measured key characteristics in both groups at the same times. By comparing the two groups’ results, we were able to discover what the effect of training really was. Our data was drawn from 57 senior business leaders who attended three half-day workshops every two weeks as well as a full-day workshop and a final facilitated conference call. We taught them mindfulness practices, discussed the implications for leadership today, and assigned home practice of daily mindfulness meditation and other exercises. We recorded the difficulties in our participants’ attempts to learn to be mindful throughout the process. We believe our findings provide a valuable, robust, and realistic guide for leaders seeking to become more mindful. Our study shows that mindfulness training and sustained practice produces statistically significant improvements in three capacities that are important for successful leadership in the 21st century: resilience, the capacity for collaboration, and the ability to lead in complex conditions. This is great news, isn’t it? An easy win. Go through a mindfulness program, and you become a better leader. But there is always a price to be paid. In this case it is formal mindfulness practice time. We asked our leaders to undertake a variety of different formal mindfulness exercises, guided by audio downloads, every day. In addition, we encouraged them to do informal mindfulness practices (such as those laid out by Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter in their article earlier this year). Our research shows that leaders who practiced the formal mindfulness exercises for more than 10 minutes per day fared much better on our key measures than those who didn’t practice much or who relied on the informal practices alone. The message is clear: If you want the benefits, you have to put in the time to practice. There is a paradox here, of course. Time is the one thing most senior leaders don’t have in abundance and are least willing to give up. So let’s put the time commitment in perspective. We know that senior executives spend an average of 1,060 minutes awake per day. And yet allocating just 10 minutes — less than 1% of their waking hours — to practicing mindfulness proves demanding for some and impossible for others. Our research points to some of the challenges that get in the way. First, leaders seek out mindfulness as a solution to their crushing work pressures, their busy timetables, their multiple task lists — and yet it is precisely these things that then get in the way of their practice. In our research, “busyness” and a focus on what needed to be done in the short term was one of the most commonly cited reasons for lack of practice. The leaders who made real changes determinedly broke through that self-defeating cycle of pressure. But we also found that the leaders frequently berated themselves for their lack of practice. They felt guilty and even anxious. One memorable quote from an exasperated leader was, “I’m stressed about this mindfulness!” As they piled pressure on themselves, some began to dislike practice and a few finally resisted altogether. Leaders can rarely develop a new habit, including practicing mindfulness, without help and support from others. Some leaders in our research received generous encouragement from their partners and work colleagues. In moments when they might have given up, this support sustained them. Others were met with cynicism and in a few cases were even teased. Fortunately, the research helped us more clearly understand the things that can help leaders practice. It isn’t surprising that they are related to the challenges above. Our research suggests that if you want to develop a formal mindfulness practice, you should: Think carefully about when you are most likely and able to practice, and then fit 10 minutes into your routine so that over time it becomes a habit. First thing in the morning works best for many. Listening to an audio exercise on your commute is popular and seems to set up the day well. Others find that the only time they can commit to is just before bed. This can work, but it can often initiate sleep before the exercise ends! Set realistic expectations for your practice; expect your experience with developing a new habit to be turbulent. Mindfulness is not about getting rid of all thoughts — it is about noticing what thoughts are there. Don’t be surprised if some days your mind is busy, fretful, or even wildly unruly. When this is the case, practice curiosity and the art of allowing. Notice times when you begin to be more mindful and acknowledge the impact this brings to you and others. Seeing the benefits in your practice is essential to continuing. If you feel comfortable doing so, tell those closest to you at work and home that you are trying to build a mindfulness practice. Tell them how they can help and support you. Connect with others who are interested in becoming more mindful. You can encourage and challenge each other to keep to the practice. Just like becoming fitter, becoming more mindful involves training. That means you have to practice. Giving up 1% of your time is a small price to pay for the improvements that are on offer.

Health How to Measure Burnout Accurately and Ethically The Maslach Burnout Inventory can be a helpful tool — but only when organizations use it carefully. by Christina Maslach and Michael P. Leiter by Christina Maslach and Michael P. Leiter March 19, 2021 MirageC/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the first scientifically developed measure of burnout and is used widely in research studies around the world. Since its first publication in 1981, the MBI has been applied for other purposes, such as individual diagnosis or organizational metrics. When used correctly, these applications of the MBI can greatly benefit employees and organizations. When used incorrectly, it can result in more confusion about what burnout is rather than greater understanding. Some of these applications are even unethical. This article explores what the MBI is, how misuses of the MBI have led to troubling outcomes, and how following the best practices for administering the MBI can help leaders design effective ways to build engagement and establish healthier workplaces. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español It is now clear that the Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated burnout and related forms of workplace distress, across many industries. This has led more organizations to become more aware of burnout, and more concerned about what to do about it. We felt it was the right time to assess the use of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in organizations. This article will give an overview about what the MBI is, cover some concerning ways that it is being misused, and show how employers should use it for the benefit of employees, organizations, and the world’s understanding of burnout. What Is the MBI? As the pandemic has spilled from 2020 into 2021, so many people in so many places are talking about burnout. The phenomenon of burnout is not new — people who have been worn out and turned off by the work they do have appeared in both fictional and nonfictional writing for centuries. In the past 60 years, the term “burnout” has become a popular way of describing this particular phenomenon that captures what many people are experiencing now. By the late 1970s, questions were crystallizing: What is the burnout experience? Why is it a problem? What causes it? Answering these questions would require research tools that did not yet exist, which led to the creation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). First published in 1981 and now with its Manual in its fourth edition, the MBI is the first scientifically developed measure of burnout and is used widely in research studies around the world. The MBI aligns with the World Health Organization’s 2019 definition of burnout as a legitimate occupational experience that organizations need to address, characterized by three dimensions: Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion Increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job Reduced professional efficacy The MBI assesses each of these three dimensions of burnout separately. Its format emerged from prior exploratory work on burnout in the 1970s, which used interviews with workers in various health and human service professions, on-site observations of the workplace, and case studies. A number of consistent themes appeared in the form of statements about personal feelings or attitudes (for example, “I feel emotionally drained from my work”), so a series of these statements became the items in the MBI measure. The MBI developed an approach based on the frequency with which people experienced those feelings, with responses ranging from “never” to “every day.” After rigorous testing, the MBI-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) was published, followed by other versions, including the MBI-Educators Survey (MBI-ES) and the MBI for medical personnel (MBI-MP). The MBI-General Survey (MBI-GS) was developed for use with people in any type of occupation, and was tested in several countries, in several languages. In all versions, the MBI yields three scores for each respondent: exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy. There is a continuum of frequency scores, from more positive to more negative, rather than an arbitrary dividing point between “present” and “absent.” A profile of burnout is indicated by more negative scores on all three dimensions. In research studies, the goal has been to study what things are associated with each of the three dimensions. For example, do some types of workplace conditions make it difficult to do the job well (lower professional efficacy) or create work overload (higher exhaustion)? Does the occurrence of burnout begin with exhaustion, which then leads to cynicism and the decline in professional efficacy, or are there other paths to burnout? Modifications and Misuses of the MBI More recently, the MBI has been applied for other purposes, such as individual diagnosis or organizational metrics. When used correctly, these applications of the MBI can greatly benefit employees and organizations. When used incorrectly, it can result in more confusion about what burnout is rather than greater understanding. Some of these applications are even unethical. The fact that the MBI produces three scores has led to some challenges. This complexity has led some to seek a simpler outcome by modifying the scoring procedure. First, some people have added the three scores together. The problem with this additive approach is that the same total score can be achieved by very different combinations of the three dimensions. Another misuse has been to consider the three dimensions as “symptoms” of burnout, and to then argue that a negative score on any one of these symptoms constitutes burnout. Another oversimplification has been to use only one question to assess each dimension. Second, some people have decided to use only one of the three dimensions of burnout (usually exhaustion), implicitly proposing a new definition of burnout. In another variation of this focus on exhaustion, some have argued that the correlation with measures of depression (which contain multiple items about exhaustion) mean that burnout is really just depression. Third, another scoring modification has involved arbitrarily dividing the sample of respondents in half and inaccurately assuming that the half that has more negative scores is burned out, and the other half is not. Some have used the descriptions of the range of scores, which divide the range into thirds (lower, mid-range, upper), as the arbitrary cutoffs for “low, medium, and high burnout.” When their study replicates that same range, they inaccurately claim that “a third of the group is highly burned out.” What leads to all these misuses? A major reason for these scoring modifications (and resulting inaccuracies) is that many think of burnout as some sort of medical disease or disability, and they want a single score that can diagnose whether individual employees have this disability or not, yet we never designed the MBI as a tool to diagnose an individual health problem. Indeed, from the beginning, burnout was not considered some type of personal illness or disease — a viewpoint that the WHO reiterated in its May 2019 statement. However, many forms of personal therapy or treatment can only occur, or be covered by insurance, if there is an officially recognized diagnosis within the overall health-care system. There has been continuing pressure to define burnout in medical terms to make it fit within that system. Even more troubling is the misuse of MBI scores to identify (sometimes publicly) people who are “diagnosed” as burned out and who therefore need to be dealt with in some way (“you should seek counseling,” “your team needs to shape up,” “you should quit if you can’t handle the job”). Research studies consider this nonconfidential use of MBI scores within organizations to be unethical. Given that there is no clinical basis for assuming that burnout is a personal disability, and no evidence for established treatments for it, the use of an individual’s scores in this way is clearly wrong. Best Practices for Using the MBI at Work The MBI was designed for discovery — both of new information that extends our knowledge about burnout and of possible strategies for change. This discovery can also take place when organizations use the MBI for practical studies and planning. When the MBI is used correctly, and in strategic combination with other relevant information, the findings can help leaders design effective ways to build engagement and establish healthier workplaces in which employees will thrive. First, new research has revealed how to bring together all three MBI dimensions in a comprehensive and meaningful way. This new scoring procedure for the three dimensions generates five profiles of people’s work experience: Burnout: negative scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy Overextended: strong negative score on exhaustion only Ineffective: strong negative score on professional efficacy only Disengaged: strong negative score on cynicism only Engagement: strong positive scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy All five of these experiences need to be better understood, not just the two extremes of burnout and engagement. When measured properly, evidence suggests that only 10% to 15% of employees fit the true burnout profile, whereas the engagement profile appears twice as often, at around 30%. That leaves over half of employees as negative in one or two dimensions — not burned out, but perhaps on the pathway there. When research data is gathered on how people are reacting to six key components of their workplace culture (workload, control, reward, community, fairness, values — as reflected by scores on the Areas of Worklife Survey, or AWS), each profile shows a very different pattern. For example, the overextended group has just one key problem: workload (high demands and low resources). But the disengaged or ineffective groups seem to have other problems, including fairness in the workplace, or social rewards and recognition. The burnout group has major issues with multiple aspects of the workplace — a pattern that stands in sharp contrast to the “exhaustion-only” overextended group. Any solution that an employer undertakes to improve the work-life experience needs to account for the varying sources of the five different patterns, rather than assuming that one type of solution will fit all. Second, organizations should not use the MBI in isolation. They should combine its findings with those of other tools to determine the likely causes of the five profiles. A single summary of employees’ MBI scores does not provide any useful guidance on why the summary looks like it does, nor does it suggest possible paths to improvement. For organizations that do not have internal resources to conduct an applied study of employee burnout and engagement, an alternative option is to obtain assessment services from consultants or test publishers. External surveyors can assure confidentiality by acting as intermediaries between employee respondents and management. They often have a greater capacity to generate individual or work group reports. Large organizations do not have one overall profile on these issues: scores vary considerably across organizational units. Important questions include: What is the percentage of each profile within various units of the organization? Is burnout a problem only in certain areas or within certain occupational specialties? The organization can then use such reports to develop optimal policies and practices to effect positive change. The online surveys for assessing burnout need to include an option for employees to provide their own written comments and suggestions. People often put a lot of thought and effort into their comments, and the results can give valuable insights, especially if themes emerge across a wide range of responses. Employers may add supplemental questions to target issues that are specific to the organization at that time. There is an important caveat with respect to these kinds of organizational assessments: organizations must share the results with the people who generated them. All too often, we have seen leaders collect information from their employees but never provide any feedback about what they learned and whether they will actually use that information for positive improvements. When employees do work that is not acknowledged, the risk of cynicism and frustration rises. It is important for leaders to reflect on the implications of the pattern of scores and the themes of the comments. Management at all levels has to clearly communicate the importance of the organizational assessment; the goal is to make positive change, and management will take action. “Burnout” has become a popular umbrella term for whatever distresses people in their work, but we hope we’ve cleared up some misconceptions. Although the label can be misused and misunderstood, it is an important red-flag warning that things can go wrong for employees on the job. That warning should not be ignored or downplayed but should incite course corrections. All stakeholders from line workers to the boardroom need a complete understanding of what burnout is and how it can be properly identified and successfully managed; this is essential to reshaping today’s workplaces and designing better ones in the future.

Peter Greenwood/Folio Art Stress The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis How the Pandemic Exacerbated Burnout A Q&A with pioneering researchers Michael Leiter and Christina Maslach. by Dave Lievens by Dave Lievens February 10, 2021 · Long read The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis 01 Beyond Burned Out 02 What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts 03 How the Pandemic Exacerbated Burnout 04 Six Lessons on Fighting Burnout from Boston’s Biggest Hospital 05 How to Beat Loneliness — and Make Friends — at Work 06 What I Learned When I Was Burned Out Summary. Michael Leiter and Christina Maslach have been at the vanguard of burnout research for over three decades, including writing influential books and creating a widely used burnout assessment. In this conversation with HBR, they explain how the Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the conditions that lead to burnout: exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy in the workplace. They discuss new data on the growing prevalence of burnout among medical professionals, what mistakes and ethical lapses organizations make when measuring burnout, how leaders can help employees bounce back after the pandemic, and how we should apply what we’ve learned about healthy and unhealthy working environments when the crisis ends. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Michael Leiter and Christina Maslach have been at the vanguard of burnout research for over three decades. They are the coauthors of The Truth About Burnout and a forthcoming book on burnout and work for Harvard University Press. Maslach is also a coauthor (with Susan Jackson) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, a widely used assessment with variants tailored for a range of populations. Leiter is a coauthor of the version of the assessment used most often in organizations. Their research shows that burnout is a workplace problem, not a worker problem. It happens when there is a bad fit — they call it mismatch — between an organization and its employees in one or more of the following areas: workers’ amount of control, fair treatment, a sense of community, workload levels, the doling out of rewards, and organizational values. Of course, there are plenty of burnout factories where employees are underappreciated and treated unfairly. But in most workplaces, under normal circumstances, employers and employees usually manage to find a healthier balance. This past year, the pandemic disrupted all of that. We invited Leiter and Maslach to share their thoughts and observations about burnout in the era of Covid-19. What follows is an edited conversation. How has the pandemic changed your thinking about burnout? In our view, 2020 did not change what burnout is — it remains a syndrome of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. If someone is experiencing high rates of all three of these at work, that indicates they are burned out, while low rates of all three indicate they are engaged. But although Covid hasn’t led to a redefinition of burnout, it has certainly aggravated it and the related forms of workplace distress. Many people are seeing an extreme intensification of their workloads and experiencing rising emotional difficulties and feelings of unfairness. Does working from home put people at greater risk for burnout? The risk varies, because people have been having so many different experiences. Remote work may have been a boon to introverts, people who thrive on long periods of uninterrupted work time, and those who hated their long commutes. But for most people, losing contact with colleagues and their day-to-day routines was distressing in itself, putting them at higher risk for exhaustion. Shifting into new modes of work and communication — say, suddenly being forced to teach a class online — can weaken one’s sense of efficacy as well. What types of workplaces are being hit the hardest by burnout? Health care is probably the industry suffering most disproportionately from burnout, for a few key reasons. Among people helping Covid-19 patients directly, an intense increase in workload has led to exhaustion. PPE shortfalls and an overall lack of preparation for this public health emergency have undercut confidence, contributing to cynicism. High rates of mortality and suffering have prompted people to withdraw emotionally. The lack of good evidence-based treatments has weakened people’s ability to feel effective. And to top it off, these conditions have persisted for months in many places and have reasserted themselves after a respite in others. Essential workers outside of health care are also highly affected. They’ve been exposed to pathogens from the public and their colleagues, and PPE was quite slow to arrive. Some industries experienced disastrous outbreaks, such as meatpacking plants, which were some of North America’s worst hot spots last spring. Employees were working longer hours and worried about being infected, and they needed to adjust to new safety practices, with implications for exhaustion and inefficacy. They also felt unfairly treated at times because their low wages hadn’t changed, while others were receiving “hero wages” or unemployment payments. What are you seeing about burnout globally? Are there meaningful differences between countries or cultures? The experiences are more similar than different. However, some Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and Korea, have had much more effective public health interventions. With their infection rates drastically lower than those in North America and Europe, these countries experienced fewer of the conditions that are aggravating burnout. Michael, you have some new data from health care workers in Canada and Australia, two countries that did a fairly good job of stemming the virus throughout last year. What have you learned so far? There’s an ongoing longitudinal study of licensed physicians in Canada that indicates the extent to which burnout is spiking among health care workers. In June 2020, the percentage experiencing burnout had risen to 23%, up from a pre-pandemic baseline of 14%. The engaged percentage fell from 36% to 27%. Remember that this is among all physicians — not just those on the front lines of the fight against Covid-19 — in a country that was doing relatively well when this data was gathered. It’s easy to imagine how much worse the numbers may be elsewhere. One bright spot was that inefficacy actually fell — by and large, physicians felt like they were still doing their work well. Our survey of an Australian hospital that was a Covid hot spot last year found high levels of exhaustion and cynicism, mainly due to the inadequacy of preparation and a breakdown in trust. When you ask these workers to share their honest experience of work during this time, it’s heartbreaking. Of course, exhaustion was rampant, but words like “undervalued,” “demoralized,” and “unfair” appear again and again. One disengaged employee wrote that they felt dispensable in the organization. Another worker, who was experiencing full burnout, described a textbook mix of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Her team was getting different assignments on a weekly basis, bouncing from ward to ward. They were given mixed messages, never sure when their normal work would resume. They ended up feeling like pawns in someone else’s game. Perceptions of unfair treatment also simmered between patient-facing staff and those who could work remotely. However, those employees who remained engaged often mentioned the benefits of working from home. Some credited their employer for being proactive in deploying PPE and taking a cautious approach. What mistakes do organizations make when they try to measure burnout? The biggest mistake is to focus exclusively on exhaustion or to use only a one- or two-item indicator. The worst method, which we see all the time, is simply asking employees, “Are you burned out?” These kinds of approaches are conceptually unsound, as they implicitly assume everyone has the same definition of burnout, and they don’t provide companies with any information on what specific problems to address. These approaches are also limited in that they don’t differentiate between people who are truly burned out and those who are just feeling ineffective, are disengaged and cynical, or are overextended but are still involved and confident. Each category calls for a distinct course of action. For instance, if people are overworked and exhausted, what they need is time off or adjustments to their workloads. But if people are truly burned out, even if you give them less work, they’re not going to feel better. They won’t trust your motives; they’ll see the help as an indictment of their competence.

Another mistake organizations make, which we think borders on the unethical, is administering the measurement but then never following up, including failing to share the results with employees. That kind of action brews employee distrust to such a level that it’s probably worse than taking no action at all. A lot of leaders misunderstand burnout, thinking it’s about an individual’s mental toughness. What do those leaders need to understand? You can’t assume that this is simply a matter of better personal resilience or more-effective individual coping. Especially right now, experiencing burnout in no way implies any personal shortcomings. The more effective action is to support people while things are in emergency conditions, like the pandemic, and to redesign the workplace to provide a sustainable, effective, and fulfilling work-life balance in normal conditions. How can organizations help their employees bounce back from Covid-related burnout when the pandemic is over? It’s important to note that not everyone who feels or appears to be burned out is experiencing the full syndrome. Feeling overextended from too much intense demand is a more straightforward thing to recover from than full-on burnout. However, there are certainly those who are suffering from all three dimensions or may as the pandemic continues. To reduce the longevity of burnout in the postcrisis world, we suggest a few things. First, recognize the contributions people have made in ways that are meaningful to them. As simple as it seems, a sincere “Thank you” or a gift of appreciation to all staff makes a big difference. Avoid singling out special or exceptional performances — who among us hasn’t been doing something special this past year? Next In The Burnout Crisis Six Lessons on Fighting Burnout from Boston’s Biggest Hospital Leaders at Mass General share their approach to supporting employees through the pandemic. Second, ensure open, honest communication between leaders and employees. This guarantees that people have a clear understanding of where things are going in the workplace, including how secure their jobs are. In addition to reducing ambiguity and confusion, this conveys respect and support: “We care about you, and we need everybody’s help to get through this successfully.” That sense of fairness, values, and social inclusion will go a long way toward preventing cynicism and inefficacy. Third, realize that things have changed. People have come up with new ways of doing their jobs that may help them work better post-pandemic. For example, you might accommodate a broader mix of people being off-site going forward. And consider that some of the tasks that did not get done during shutdowns may not need to be done at all in the future. Relatedly, you should encourage people to do whatever works best for them to recover. Sleep is essential for everyone, of course. But the main thing is for employees to enjoy whatever activities help them feel better. You’ll also want to publicly commit to serious planning for future crises. When people see their employer preparing for future emergencies, it reaffirms that you care about their well-being. Finally, going forward, we should all consider new models of healthy work environments, including rethinking the hours and place of work as well as how our jobs get done. We need to take into account not just what causes burnout and what makes work harder for people but also what better place we want to get to and how we want to redesign organizations. It’s going to involve remaking workplaces in new, innovative ways.

Leadership & Managing people Staying Mindful When You’re Working Remotely Don’t just be online — be present. by Alyson Meister and Amanda Sinclair by Alyson Meister and Amanda Sinclair March 16, 2021 HBR Staff Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Remote work is taking its toll in the form of chronic stress and burnout. Cultivating mindfulness in our online environment is a way to combat this depletion of energy. The authors recommend applying three mindfulness principles to your remote work to reduce stress levels and reconnect with your purpose. First, offer your team your presence by eliminating distractions and focusing on how you’re being with the people you’re speaking to. Next, be in the moment by focusing on where you are now, rather than thinking about the future. Finally, enable connection and community by practicing deep listening and paying close attention to inclusion. Remote working doesn’t have to be a barrier to your capacity to deliver leadership presence, empathize and connect with colleagues, and build strong workplace communities. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español It’s no surprise that online work is depleting our energy and resilience. The evidence shows that many of us are working longer hours, suffering chronic stress, and burning out at levels the world has never witnessed. At the same time, we’re longing for and losing our social connections and sometimes experiencing profound loneliness and grief in solitude. To regain energy, find renewed pleasure in our work, and truly connect with colleagues and friends, we need to find ways to block out the noise in our virtual reality. One way we can do that is through cultivating mindfulness — online. Mindfulness is the choice we make to be present in the here and now: This moment, in this meeting, with this person or group of people. Research shows that most activities of our working lives, from working on an independent task to team meetings and one on ones, benefit from being conducted with mindfulness. By pausing, checking in with others, or starting meetings with a few moments of meditation or reflection, stress levels drop and we feel more connected to our purpose and to others in the room. We listen better and feel happier. But how can we be mindful in an online working world? How can we be truly present for others when we couldn’t be (physically) farther from one another? What we learned from 2020 is that online and remote working doesn’t have to be a barrier to our capacity to deliver leadership presence, empathize and connect with colleagues, and build strong workplace communities. Contrary to popular misconceptions, you don’t have to retreat to a mountain top or a meditation cushion to practice mindfulness. You can do it while working from home by: Pausing and noticing where your thinking mind is Purposefully bringing your awareness to the people and context that are with you virtually Suspending your own narratives, agendas, judgements, and ego to offer your full online presence, evidenced through eye contact, warm and responsive facial expressions, and minimized multitasking You can apply these three principles of mindfulness to managing and leading online. From doing to being: Offer your presence. Action is the hallmark of managers. It’s what they’re noticed for and measured on: Doing, achieving, producing, organizing, controlling. New remote and hybrid working environments have thrust managers into excessive patterns of “doing.” But sometimes, who and how you’re being can be more important than your actions. To cultivate trust and motivate and inspire others, pay attention to how you’re being with them. Are you rushed or distracted? Is your mind on the next meeting or your to-do list? To enhance the quality of your leadership presence with others, take a moment to reflect on your physical and emotional state when entering a new meeting. Through your virtual presence, what energy will you convey to this set of colleagues or clients? Will you bring the tough conversation you just had with someone else into this new one? Will you offer a sense of calm and reassurance? Another’s presence (or lack thereof) is noticeable. When someone is speaking, are you using the moment to check your email, send a text, or schedule a meeting? You may think that none of this shows in online working contexts. But just as in a face-to-face meeting room, virtual participants know whether and how you’re truly present with them — emotions and attention can be broadcast, felt, and contagious across virtual boundaries. Even in a big online town hall, the audience can sense if the speaker is truly with them, and the speaker knows if most of the audience is elsewhere. Lead by example when working remotely. Try to have your camera on and ask others to do so if possible. Ensure others can feel your presence by establishing eye contact, and use your body and posture to convey interest and empathy. If you know you just can’t help but look, turn off those enticing email notifications. Shifting your focus to how you’re being doesn’t mean that things don’t get done. And none of these shifts in your awareness and attention take more than a few moments. But they do have impact on you and on those you’re working with. From future to present: Be here, now. Managers are taught to relentlessly plan for the future. Yet always having your mind on next month’s targets or next year’s profits can mean you miss life today. You forgo important opportunities for connection and empowering others if you’re in your mind, planning “the next step” or worrying about something that might not happen. Take a moment to step back from the busy-ness and view your tasks with perspective — looking down from the balcony. What or who is important right now? Ask yourself: Am I postponing life, thinking that all the good stuff will come next month, next year, or when lockdowns and pandemic restrictions end? Postponing life can exacerbate unhappiness and stress. We hold out for when things will improve but don’t see all the beautiful small things around us now: A fun meal with family, a morning walk or run, the sharing of a special moment or a celebration with colleagues. Next time you’re in a virtual meeting and notice your mind has wandered off, catch yourself. Bring your mind to where your body actually is — this present moment, right here, right now. Take a few seconds to anchor your awareness in the now by drawing on your senses. Look outside if you can, and take in any sky or green that may be visible. Relax your shoulders and your jaw. Breathe out. These momentary connections with your physical senses are the gateways to being more present. Sharing some words of gratitude for people showing up and for what exists in the here and now can help others to pause and pay attention. They may notice they’ve been ruminating and can choose to tune in, not tune out. Practicing mindfulness techniques like these has been demonstrated to lift moods, foster well-being, and improve overall psychological health. From me to you: Enabling connection and community. When people are talking, where is your mind? Is it with them? Or are you waiting for a gap to jump in with your opinion or experience? Can you suspend your own agendas and ego needs to hear what people on the team need? Try deepening your listening. Try listening without wanting to “fix” people or (perhaps silently) insisting they get over things. Deep listening is generous. Encourage the person speaking to discover and voice a way forward. They will appreciate and be empowered by it, finding their own path or solution. In our executive development work, we have found that virtual meetings can reduce barriers for people to speak and to have their voice and presence heard and felt. For example, tools like “raise hand” indicators and simultaneous chat functions enable different ways for people to offer insight and signal their contribution. Further, that everyone has one equal-sized window with only a headshot in a virtual meeting can diminish stereotypes, hierarchies, and power differentials as certain physical and status markers are removed. As a mindful leader, be aware of who is present, and pay particular attention to inclusion. Welcome and seek people’s input, especially from those who usually don’t say much. Endorsing expressions of openness and vulnerability can help cultivate a culture of appreciation and psychological safety. As a leader, you might offer some vulnerability about where you are right now, which will open the space for others to express how they really are. You might be juggling the needs of a sick child or a parent in aged care. The circumstances of online working have sometimes meant we’ve had to get more real. People are tuning in from their living rooms and bedrooms. They have families, pets, and other competing needs to accommodate. We’ve had to take off our office masks, our make-up, and our constructed work identities and allow others to see us more fully. This has surely been a good thing.

Peter Greenwood/Folio Art Managing people The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis Beyond Burned Out Chronic stress was rampant even before the pandemic. Leaders can’t ignore it any longer. by Jennifer Moss by Jennifer Moss February 10, 2021 · Long read The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis 01 Beyond Burned Out 02 What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts 03 How the Pandemic Exacerbated Burnout 04 Six Lessons on Fighting Burnout from Boston’s Biggest Hospital 05 How to Beat Loneliness — and Make Friends — at Work 06 What I Learned When I Was Burned Out Summary. In our always-on world, burnout has long been a threat. But in 2020 burnout became rampant, seemingly overnight. Within weeks millions of people lost their jobs and faced financial and food insecurity. People working on the front lines worried for their physical safety, and those in health care put their lives at risk every day. A third of U.S. employees started “living at work” — with the kitchen table as their new pseudo-office. Over the year acute stress would become chronic stress. And it shows few signs of abating. Today’s level of burnout is the result of an existing problem made exponentially worse. Yet despite how massive the problem is, it’s never too late to fix it. Combating burnout may feel like an overwhelming and herculean task, especially after months of emotional fatigue, but if you’re armed with the right tools, it can be easier than you might think. And ready or not, we can’t ignore the urgency — we are in the midst of a burnout epidemic. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print When the Covid-19 pandemic began, I felt as if I were in one of those disaster movies, standing in front of a rapidly spreading fire as an entire city was about to be engulfed in flames. And despite feeling that a massive disruption was imminent, I could only watch in shock. I’ve studied burnout and worked with organizations to address it for years, but nothing would inform my understanding of the topic more than living through 2020. For some time I’d been sounding the alarm: “Burnout is getting worse. People are sick!” Then we were all suddenly thrust into unknown territory: By April 2.6 billion people had gone into lockdown, and places of employment for 81% of the global workforce were fully or partially closed. A huge percentage of knowledge workers began doing their jobs from home — many collaborating on Zoom, whose daily active users skyrocketed from 10 million to 200 million. This sudden shift did what little else had been able to accomplish before: expose how thinly stretched and worn down we all were — and had been for a while. And it also made our burnout much, much worse. Just How Bad Is Burnout? Jennifer Moss is a workplace expert, international public speaker, and award-winning journalist. She is the bestselling author of Unlocking Happiness at Work (Kogan Page, 2021) and the forthcoming book The Burnout Epidemic (HBR Press, September 2021). Although the concept of occupational burnout originated in the 1970s, the medical community has long argued about how to define it. In 2019 the World Health Organization finally included burnout in its International Classification of Diseases, describing it as “a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” This language acknowledged that burnout is more than just an employee problem; it’s an organizational problem that requires an organizational solution. When you analyze the real causes of burnout, it becomes clear that almost everyone has been attacking the problem from the wrong angle. According to Christina Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, Susan E. Jackson of Rutgers, and Michael Leiter of Deakin University, burnout has six main causes: Unsustainable workload Perceived lack of control Insufficient rewards for effort Lack of a supportive community Lack of fairness Mismatched values and skills While these are all organizational issues, we still prescribe self-care as the cure for burnout. We’ve put the burden of solving the problem squarely on the shoulders of individual employees. “Let’s just recommend more yoga, wellness tech, meditation apps, and subsidized gym memberships — that’ll fix it,” we say. But those are tools for improving well-being. When it comes to preventing burnout specifically, they won’t be effective. We desperately need upstream interventions, not downstream tactics. In this article I’ll describe tactics companies can use to address some of the organizational roots of burnout. The Burnout Crisis: Get the reprint download PDF buy copies Teaming up together, Leiter, Maslach, and David Whiteside, the director of insights and research at YMCA WorkWell, and I created a survey that analyzes the state of burnout and well-being during Covid-19. We combined several evidence-based scales, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS), a psychological assessment of occupational burnout, and the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS), which assesses employees’ perceptions of work-setting qualities that affect whether they experience engagement or burnout. With support from Harvard Business Review, we gathered feedback from more than 1,500 respondents in 46 countries, in various sectors, roles, and seniority levels, in the fall of 2020. Sixty-seven percent of respondents worked at or above a supervisor level. What did we learn, in a nutshell? Burnout is a global problem. Some stats: 89% of respondents said their work life was getting worse. 85% said their well-being had declined. 56% said their job demands had increased. 62% of the people who were struggling to manage their workloads had experienced burnout “often” or “extremely often” in the previous three months. 57% of employees felt that the pandemic had a “large effect on” or “completely dominated” their work. 55% of all respondents didn’t feel that they had been able to balance their home and work life — with 53% specifically citing homeschooling. 25% felt unable to maintain a strong connection with family, 39% with colleagues, and 50% with friends. Only 21% rated their well-being as “good,” and a mere 2% rated it as “excellent.” The 1,500 people in our survey not only much more squarely fit the burnout profile than did the nearly 50,000 respondents who had taken the MBI-GS before the pandemic, they also scored very high on exhaustion and cynicism — two predictors of burnout, according to the MBI-GS. “These survey responses make it clear that a lot of people are having serious disruptions in their relationship with work,” Leiter notes. “It’s not surprising that people are more exhausted — people are working hard to keep their work and personal lives afloat. But the rise in cynicism is even more troubling. Cynicism reflects a lack of trust in the world. So many people feel let down by their government’s poor preparation for the pandemic, as well as by the injustices in work and well-being that the pandemic has highlighted.” A primer on burnout from our partners at Ascend, a job and life advice channel for young professionals. Millennials have the highest levels of burnout, we found. Much of this is due to having less autonomy at work, lower seniority, and greater financial stressors and feelings of loneliness. The last was the biggest factor leading to burnout, according to our research. As one Millennial put it: “The pandemic has had a tremendous impact on my well-being — I’ve had mental health challenges, and I’ve hit major roadblocks with that. My physical health has changed because I can’t exercise like I used to. It’s affected me economically. I feel as though my career has been set back yet again.” How Did It Get This Bad? So, yes, burnout is severe today, but the seeds were planted before Covid-19 hit — even then, many workers were already experiencing high levels of it. The pandemic was simply an accelerant. Consider teachers. Pre-pandemic, they endured long hours and chronic underpay. Nurses and physicians, who have seen some of the most extreme cases of burnout, worked notoriously long shifts — often 16 hours or more, despite research showing that patient errors increase threefold when nurses (for example) work shifts lasting 12.5 hours or longer. In other sectors — such as technology — overwork is celebrated, even though research clearly shows that putting in more than 55 hours a week does nothing to improve job performance. For example, in 2018 Elon Musk tweeted the following in response to a Wall Street Journal article describing Tesla’s culture of long hours: “There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” What number of hours is needed to change the world? “About 80 sustained,” Musk tweeted. Former employees of Uber shared in 2017 that working until 1 or 2 AM was typical at the company, and a 2015 New York Times article about Amazon described “marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access while on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.” It didn’t help matters that during the pandemic we misdiagnosed the resulting stress as acute rather than chronic. And once it was clear that the crisis was a triathlon, not a sprint or even a marathon, organizations did very little to help employees over the long term in meaningful ways, abandoning or failing to adapt their initial efforts. In the first weeks of the pandemic, most organizations were expecting it to end quickly. Remote workers were given a return-by date of one month. Then another month. Then in May big tech companies like Facebook and Google extended working from home to the end of the year. (They have since extended it well into 2021.) In the meantime people were left to figure out their new WFH arrangements largely on their own. We also saw a surge in “well-being by video,” as leaders scrambled to figure out how to replace the at-work experience with a virtual one. Team building now included Zoom happy hours and morning stretch sessions. In the first few weeks these virtual events were jam-packed, but within a month well-being measures just became part of the staff’s workload and there was no “happy” left in online social hours. Several large-chain grocery stores in Canada and the United States chose to give their frontline workers “hero pay,” only to claw it back after a few months. (Some retailers are restoring it, but many have abandoned the policy.) In the spring, physicians, nurses, and first responders were celebrated with parades and applause. Over time the cheers stopped. The applause faded at the worst possible time — when health care workers needed it most. They already had the highest rates of burnout, but the pandemic took them to unprecedented levels. It’s understandable that we might not have recognized the true impact of the pandemic at first. So much was unknown. But once we realized we were in it for the long haul, we could have slowed down and analyzed what was working and what wasn’t. We could have been more creative about changing practices to ease burnout. But we didn’t. Instead of pumping the brakes when the virus spread and acute stress began to become chronic, we made things worse in these key areas: We didn’t adjust workloads. Overwork was the most-cited reason for burnout and decreased well-being in our pre-pandemic qualitative research. Research from Gallup has shown that the risk of occupational burnout increases significantly when an employee’s workweek averages more than 50 hours, and rises even more substantially at 60 hours. Clearly, this issue has not gone away. If anything, the pandemic has probably exacerbated it. One respondent to our recent survey shared, “Everything seems like a rush. There’s more pressure to produce, and no one respects time boundaries. Emails start at 5:30 AM and don’t end until 10 PM, because they know you have nowhere else to go. For single people with no families, it’s worse, because you don’t get to say, ‘I need to go take care of my kids.’” We didn’t give people control and flexibility. The pandemic brought employees a host of new challenges. Childcare options were limited, with day care centers and schools closed and grandparents separated from their extended families. Parents were grappling with homeschooling children while working from home — with the whole family on the same Wi-Fi connection — and dealing with increased household chores resulting from suddenly having everyone under the same roof 24/7. Some organizations saw the value of allowing employees more flexibility, but too many did not. I suspect this stems from the way the notion of flexibility has long been steeped in bias, with some considering it “a mother’s benefit.” The lockdown tested that idea, but in the end the existing systemic failures of workplace policies and biases about women proved disastrous. Gains for women would be lost, with serious consequences. According to the Center for American Progress, “four times as many women as men dropped out of the labor force in September, roughly 865,000 women compared with 216,000 men.” Black, Latinx, and Indigenous women are experiencing this most acutely because of “the multiple effects of being more likely to have lost their jobs, being on the front lines as essential workers, and solving their childcare challenges on their own.” “There’s no respite from work,” shared one woman in our survey. “I work 9 to 9 almost every day. My husband is working in the office, and I’m working from the kitchen counter, with the baby in the living room. I don’t get time to focus on anything. If I’m spending five minutes with my son, my instant messages are blowing up (and I hear the noise). If I’m working with my back to my son, I’m constantly turning around to check on him.” The impact of the disruption to women’s ability to work is enormous. Even a 5% decline in maternal labor force participation would set women back 25 years, according to the report. We allowed more meetings and unhealthful levels of screen time. We talk about Zoom burnout as if it’s a new thing. In reality, it’s just a new manifestation of a bad workplace practice on overdrive. We’ve had meeting fatigue forever. According to Steven Rogelberg of UNC Charlotte, who wrote The Surprising Science of Meetings, pre-Covid-19 studies showed that about 55 million meetings a day were held in the United States alone and that U.S. organizations wasted $37 billion annually because most meetings were unproductive. Despite all that, meetings increased substantially during the pandemic. According to a recent study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research that analyzed the data on more than 3 million people, the amount of time employees spend in meetings has increased by 13%. In addition the average workday is now 48 minutes longer. What’s especially troubling here is that video calls are actually harder on us physically and mentally. Our brains find it more challenging to process nonverbal cues like facial expressions and body language on them, making it tough to relax during conversations. Plus, slight delays in verbal responses subconsciously make us dislike people, according to research cited by Jena Lee, an attending psychiatrist and assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “I sit all day. My ankles were swelling at one point, and I had to sleep with my feet elevated. I don’t sleep well. I have no time to do anything I enjoy,” one of our survey respondents told us. “I go from one Webex or Teams meeting to the next.” We didn’t recognize the extent of people’s struggles. Burnout, when experienced in the extreme, can be tragic. That’s what Corey Feist, who is outspoken on the topic of physician burnout, emphasized to me in the wake of his sister-in-law’s suicide last April. Dr. Lorna Breen was the medical director of the emergency department at a hospital in Manhattan. She was working on the front lines, deep into the first surge of a locked-down New York City as the virus raged through it. Feist remembers Breen describing the hospital as “Armageddon.” Peter Greenwood/Folio Art The factors that played a role in her burnout, according to Feist, are multifold. “First she contracted Covid-19 and was exhausted, depleted, and probably dealing with the brain fog that we now know impacts people with the virus. Then she went back into the workforce way too fast. On top of still being sick and exhausted, she would now face a volume of death and dying that she’d never seen before. Add in feelings around not being able to contribute and not being able to take care of your patients — because they were dying, and doctors are trained to fix people — and it was all so overwhelming.” Not every case is as distressing as Breen’s. But her story points to a key truth: One big problem of the pandemic is that we simply haven’t realized — much less acknowledged — how hard circumstances are. And we’ve been applying Band-Aid solutions to a gaping wound in the form of yoga programs, wellness technology, and meditation apps. The need to recognize that people are working unsustainably day after day, that they may not feel safe talking about their mental health, and that they’re overwhelmed and exhausted is urgent. There is no app to fix that. And the vast majority of senior leaders have told us that they’re tired, too — and tired of leading tired people. This global pandemic is not “business as usual,” so we need to stop acting as if it is. How to Beat Burnout There are some easy things we can all do to combat burnout, most critically at the organizational level. There was good news in our research, and it illuminated where we need to focus. Factors that predicted lower levels of burnout included the following: Feeling a sense of purpose. Respondents said that this feeling helped defend against burnout at work. In fact, burnout scores declined as purpose scores increased: Twenty-five percent of people who felt a strong sense of purpose in their work had not experienced any burnout (according to both self-reporting and the MBI-GS) in the previous three months. However, since the data reflects knowledge-worker sentiment, I wouldn’t want to suggest that employees on the front lines or first responders should rely on purpose to prevent burnout. This finding requires more analysis, but my colleagues and I found it to be an important insight. Having a manageable workload. This was one of the strongest predictors of lower burnout. To help overburdened employees, organizations should communicate more about priorities and about what can be put on the back burner until time permits (or perhaps forever). One of the most glaring issues related to workload was meeting fatigue — it tops the list of things organizations must tackle. To begin to address it, use this simple formula: Ask, Is this meeting necessary? If yes, then ask: Does it have to be a video call? Does it have to be longer than 30 minutes? Which attendees are absolutely essential? Can we turn off our cameras and use our photos or avatars instead? Can we do an audio-only conference call for a much-needed screen break? Start meetings with a check-in: How are people feeling? Does anyone have a back-to-back call? If you’re leading the meeting, set a timer so you can let anyone who does have one jump off five to 10 minutes early. Feeling that you can discuss your mental health at work. Our survey found that nearly half of respondents don’t believe they can openly do this — and 65% of those people experienced burnout “often or always.” That is a massive problem. The first step toward solving it is to create a culture of psychological safety at work, which Harvard Business School’s Amy Edmondson, who is an expert on the topic, defines as “a climate in which people are comfortable being (and expressing) themselves.” For example, when someone messes up, we may get angry. Yes, we all have a right to be frustrated, but whom does that serve? The bigger goal is to set things right. Edmondson suggests that more-productive responses start with asking about what help is required to get back on track. That is, after all, what we really care about. When this kind of communication is common, people generally feel safer talking about more-personal topics, like mental health. Another tactic is to offer employees access to mental health support. That could include: A mental health resource page listing local outreach programs and mental health practitioners that are cause- or crisis-specific. Reduced hours, flexible hours, or even paid time off for anyone who has mental or physical health concerns — or who is caring for a loved one affected by the crisis. We were dramatically caught off guard by the pandemic. This can’t happen again — time off and grief policies should be readied now. A peer-to-peer outreach program. Firms can select leaders to train in mental health 101, who can then be activated as a support system for the staff in a crisis. Having managers check in on their direct reports immediately. The pandemic was a jarring example of how quickly a crisis can escalate. If we have communication plans in place before disaster hits, we can provide answers to pressing issues. Just by asking more frequently “How are you doing?” and “How can I help?” we’ll demonstrate that the well-being of our team is a priority. Having an empathetic manager. This was the second-most-cited need in the survey, just slightly behind manageable workloads. And for good reason: According to Harvard Medical School’s Helen Riess, who is also the cofounder and chief scientist of Empathetics, communicating empathically increases job satisfaction, reduces burnout, and is highly correlated with enhanced well-being. It is perhaps the most critical skill in a crisis and something that we can all improve on. Empathetic leadership requires three things: acknowledging and overcoming any personal biases and privileges you might have; actively listening to your people; and taking action. I want to focus on the second — active listening — as something that’s particularly important today. It involves giving people a safe place to share and demonstrating that you’ve heard them by acting on their words. You can do this one-on-one or set up open forums through Slack or Teams or any other workplace social collaboration tool, where good ideas can proliferate. You may also want to create the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback; there are survey tools out there that make it easy to do that.

Another unique way to combat burnout is to become a “professional eavesdropper,” according to Martha Bird, a business anthropologist for the data processing company ADP. Why? Because it’s often the small things we say and do over time that account for the bigger picture on our well-being. “People are messy, and the messiness is what tells us the most,” she told me. “We humans attempt to make the mess meaningful. And that meaning is reflected in what we do.” Bird is suggesting that we need to look deeper than an occasional “How are you doing?” One study found that on average an adult will say “I’m fine” 14 times a week, though only 19% of people really mean it. Almost a third of the 2,000 people in our survey said that they often lie about how they’re feeling. By paying closer attention to what your employees are talking about and seeing patterns, you can spot and head off problems. So the next time people say they’re fine, ask again, “Are you really fine? It’s OK if you’re not. I’m here if you need to talk.” Having a strong sense of connection to family and friends. Our survey highlighted how many of us feel isolated. Before offices went virtual, one of the most healthful benefits of work was that it allowed us to establish and build friendships. That’s much more difficult, if not impossible, to do remotely. “I started this job six days before the pandemic meant that we had to work from home. I found it challenging to connect with new colleagues over Zoom calls,” one survey respondent wrote. “Even when I do go to the office, we are not allowed to meet in person. I think I have spent a total of about 10 hours face-to-face with my colleagues, and maybe 40 to 60 hours in Zoom meetings with them. It’s hardly enough to build trust and respect in a way that would feel meaningful to me.” Next In The Burnout Crisis What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts The pandemic has led to mental health declines, increased work demands, and feelings of loneliness. But the news isn’t all bad. Personally, I think some companies went too far too fast by making work from home a “forever” policy. Nearly three-quarters of employees want to have access to an office, according to a recent JLL survey of more than 2,000 employees across 10 countries. And 80% of high performers have missed their office greatly during lockdown, according to the same report. Flexible options are what workplace experts have long been arguing for. As soon as it is safe to do so, we need to create hybrid solutions that allow coworkers to connect and collaborate in person and virtually. Rich Barton, CEO of Zillow, has chosen to offer both work-from-home and in-office options. “The way our team delivered after we went remote turned my legacy opinion of working from home on its head and began a journey toward letting our people decide where they will thrive and be the most productive,” he told me. The best relationships are still built when we can see one another’s faces in person. The need to socially distance for almost a year now has taken a toll. So once the pandemic’s risks subside, leaders need to find ways to bring their teams back together in a physical space to connect in real life. Prepare Before the Next Crisis Of course, this is all just a starting point for how companies can address burnout. But the point I want to hammer home is this: Leaders, get the right systems in place now, before the next crisis happens. I’ve found that the companies that were already engaged in a burnout prevention strategy have been more successful at leading their workforce through the Covid-19 crisis. And I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the number of leaders who were deeply motivated to support their workforce. Here is one example that stood out for me. Alan May is the executive vice president and chief people officer for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). I spoke with May in October 2020, when nearly all the company’s 60,000 employees were working remotely. He believes HPE’s long-standing commitment to well-being has helped it weather the year’s challenges. “Crises tend to just accelerate underlying trends,” he observed. He hasn’t been creating wellness programs only in response to Covid-19; when it hit, the company was already two years into an internal campaign focused on them. Long before the pandemic, HPE was addressing burnout. One of the examples May shared was having “meetingless Fridays” to create “white space” for employees to work on ideating or reflecting. He also reinforced the importance of having frontline managers check in with employees regularly. While he’s not expecting those managers to be mental health experts, he shared that “in a number of cases, as a result of some of those interactions, we’ve detected some concerns, and we’ve been able to escalate them and get more professional help.” May also had created virtual social chat groups for peer-to-peer communication, where leaders could also actively engage, to bring together like-minded individuals with no real objectives. “We didn’t proctor the groups, but we did participate to some extent by listening,” said May. And when the crisis hit and “employees started sharing specific tips and tools for others working at home or specific suggestions for those that were homebound and lonely, it just became all about lifting up those good ideas and executing on them.” The resilience HPE employees appear to have built up seems to have served them well during the pandemic. According to the firm’s “Employee Work Experience Data” from July 2020: 91% of employees agreed that employee health and well-being was a top priority for HPE. 92% agreed that their direct leaders had shown genuine concern for their well-being. 91% agreed that their direct leaders had shown flexibility by allowing them to balance their personal and professional lives. Employee experience scores like these send an important message: “We feel supported. Keep it up.” If your organization also wants to foster great workplace experiences, well-being must be table stakes. Put mental health and burnout prevention protocols in place now. Prepare a communication strategy well in advance, so that when another crisis hits, information about support programs and details on any new health and safety measures can be shared instantly with employees. Keep in mind that poor communication during the Covid crisis has been a primary regret for more than a third of C-level leaders — and that 32% of employees surveyed claimed they yearned for more communication, done sooner and more transparently. . . . There is no quick fix for any of the burnout issues we’re facing, and sometimes that can feel paralyzing. We need to start small, or the task will seem too overwhelming. Big change starts with modest practical steps, working toward collective change. We can’t waste this crisis. The well-worn phrase “Knowing is half the battle” feels applicable here. If we can identify organizational signals of stress — because we are finally paying attention — then there is hope for the future. Leaders, we have endured a trial by fire, and there’s no turning back. We did not experience this crash course in emotional flexibility — this testing of our resilience — only to squander the learning. We have a shot at truly preventing burnout, and we can’t say that it’s too hard or too much work or that it requires too much change. The best moment to make a move is when everything is up for grabs. It’s time to turn the change that was inevitable into the change that was always possible. Starting right now.

Leadership Mindfulness Works but Only If You Work at It Give it at least 10 minutes a day. by Megan Reitz and Michael Chaskalson by Megan Reitz and Michael Chaskalson November 04, 2016 Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español The latest trend in leadership development is mindfulness training. There is a burgeoning array of apps, self-help books, and corporate interventions designed to help leaders become more mindful and thus more resilient, focused, and aware — qualities that many executives believe can make them more effective in their roles. Mindfulness — a way of paying attention with care and discernment to yourself, others, and the world around you — has been much researched. But although evidence from clinical contexts suggests that mindfulness provides many benefits, few studies have been conducted with business leaders. This means that basic questions have remained unanswered. For example, does mindfulness training actually improve leadership capacities? If it does, how? And how much effort do you need to make to achieve results? Trying to answer these and other important questions, we conducted the world’s first study of a multisession mindful leader program, which included a wait-list control group. Half of the participants received their training immediately and the other half received it later, but we measured key characteristics in both groups at the same times. By comparing the two groups’ results, we were able to discover what the effect of training really was. Our data was drawn from 57 senior business leaders who attended three half-day workshops every two weeks as well as a full-day workshop and a final facilitated conference call. We taught them mindfulness practices, discussed the implications for leadership today, and assigned home practice of daily mindfulness meditation and other exercises. We recorded the difficulties in our participants’ attempts to learn to be mindful throughout the process. We believe our findings provide a valuable, robust, and realistic guide for leaders seeking to become more mindful. Our study shows that mindfulness training and sustained practice produces statistically significant improvements in three capacities that are important for successful leadership in the 21st century: resilience, the capacity for collaboration, and the ability to lead in complex conditions. This is great news, isn’t it? An easy win. Go through a mindfulness program, and you become a better leader. But there is always a price to be paid. In this case it is formal mindfulness practice time. We asked our leaders to undertake a variety of different formal mindfulness exercises, guided by audio downloads, every day. In addition, we encouraged them to do informal mindfulness practices (such as those laid out by Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter in their article earlier this year). Our research shows that leaders who practiced the formal mindfulness exercises for more than 10 minutes per day fared much better on our key measures than those who didn’t practice much or who relied on the informal practices alone. The message is clear: If you want the benefits, you have to put in the time to practice. There is a paradox here, of course. Time is the one thing most senior leaders don’t have in abundance and are least willing to give up. So let’s put the time commitment in perspective. We know that senior executives spend an average of 1,060 minutes awake per day. And yet allocating just 10 minutes — less than 1% of their waking hours — to practicing mindfulness proves demanding for some and impossible for others. Our research points to some of the challenges that get in the way. First, leaders seek out mindfulness as a solution to their crushing work pressures, their busy timetables, their multiple task lists — and yet it is precisely these things that then get in the way of their practice. In our research, “busyness” and a focus on what needed to be done in the short term was one of the most commonly cited reasons for lack of practice. The leaders who made real changes determinedly broke through that self-defeating cycle of pressure. But we also found that the leaders frequently berated themselves for their lack of practice. They felt guilty and even anxious. One memorable quote from an exasperated leader was, “I’m stressed about this mindfulness!” As they piled pressure on themselves, some began to dislike practice and a few finally resisted altogether. Leaders can rarely develop a new habit, including practicing mindfulness, without help and support from others. Some leaders in our research received generous encouragement from their partners and work colleagues. In moments when they might have given up, this support sustained them. Others were met with cynicism and in a few cases were even teased. Fortunately, the research helped us more clearly understand the things that can help leaders practice. It isn’t surprising that they are related to the challenges above. Our research suggests that if you want to develop a formal mindfulness practice, you should: Think carefully about when you are most likely and able to practice, and then fit 10 minutes into your routine so that over time it becomes a habit. First thing in the morning works best for many. Listening to an audio exercise on your commute is popular and seems to set up the day well. Others find that the only time they can commit to is just before bed. This can work, but it can often initiate sleep before the exercise ends! Set realistic expectations for your practice; expect your experience with developing a new habit to be turbulent. Mindfulness is not about getting rid of all thoughts — it is about noticing what thoughts are there. Don’t be surprised if some days your mind is busy, fretful, or even wildly unruly. When this is the case, practice curiosity and the art of allowing. Notice times when you begin to be more mindful and acknowledge the impact this brings to you and others. Seeing the benefits in your practice is essential to continuing. If you feel comfortable doing so, tell those closest to you at work and home that you are trying to build a mindfulness practice. Tell them how they can help and support you. Connect with others who are interested in becoming more mindful. You can encourage and challenge each other to keep to the practice. Just like becoming fitter, becoming more mindful involves training. That means you have to practice. Giving up 1% of your time is a small price to pay for the improvements that are on offer.

Gender Your Company’s Pay Gap Is About More Than Money A framework to help you identify, measure, and address inequity. by Kate Gautier and Lalith Munasinghe by Kate Gautier and Lalith Munasinghe March 31, 2021 Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. The authors offer a new methodology to help organizations diagnose gender inequities and point to next steps. Using this methodology, companies will be able to make evidence-based decisions about whether to invest their equity budget in, for example, anti-bias and inclusion training to remedy a culture problem or a comprehensive compensation audit to address pay discrimination. The analysis uses data in three stages — compensation, representation, and finally job satisfaction — to reveal hidden gender inequities. Similarly, the analysis could focus on racial equity instead of gender equity by examining differences between, say Black employees and white employees instead of between men and women. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español A multinational company employing approximately 22,000 software engineers, mostly in the U.S. and India, had a problem: In the organization as a whole, women were paid on average 33% less than men: For every dollar men made, women earned only 67 cents. But, when comparing women to men with similar job titles, skills, and company tenure, this pay gap shrank to a mere 3% — still statistically significant but practically of much less consequence. The company was performing an equity analysis — they wanted to ensure that employees were being treated and paid fairly— and so their next step was to look at their org chart. There they found, unsurprisingly, that there were relatively fewer women in higher-paying job positions than in lower-paying ones. But in digging deeper, with our help, they realized that simply promoting women into the upper ranks would not close their gap. This company’s experience is unfortunately not unique. In our consulting practice, where we help companies bring a data-driven approach to their people management practices, we have encountered several executives who want to understand where their organizations stand in terms of gender equity.They sometimes have a sense of the problem, but aren’t sure what to measure or where to start. To solve this problem, we have been using an analysis framework that uses internal data to identify and measure six distinct but interrelated dimensions of equity. Our focus here is on gender, but this framework can easily be applied to measure equity along other axes, including race or ethnicity. Our analysis begins with compensation, moves to representation, which we then account for by examining hires, promotions, and exits, and finally ends with job satisfaction. We’ve found that this methodology points to underlying causes in a way that traditional compensation analyses alone cannot. Here’s how it works. Measuring Gender Equity Your organization needs to consider these six factors: Dimensions of equity Key metric Description and interpretation Pay Compensation Examine the gender pay gap with and without controls. If a pay gap is observed even after controlling for the appropriate human capital attributes, this points to an issue with pay discrimination at the level of compensation decisions (e.g., in negotiations). If a pay gap is observed at the organization level but disappears with the appropriate human capital controls, the primary issue is likely to be with representation, not pay discrimination. Representation Head count Examine the gender breakdown across the organizational hierarchy. Compare the representation of women in higher positions to that in lower positions. If women are underrepresented in the top of the hierarchy compared to the organizational average, this indicates inequities of representation. Assess entries and exits to determine the primary drivers of under or overrepresentation. Development Promotions Compare promotion rates for men and women, controlling for job position. Discrepancies may indicate discrimination in subjective evaluations, training opportunities, opportunities to take on stretch projects, mentorship, etc. Retention Turnover Compare turnover rates for men and women, controlling for job position. Assess whether there are gender differences across the job hierarchy. If women are at increased turnover risk, it may indicate cultural issues, lack of development opportunities, non–family-friendly policies, etc. Opportunity Hiring Examine the gender breakdown of new hires entering the organization at each level. If women are underrepresented in hires for the top of the hierarchy compared to the organizational averages, it may indicate discrimination in the hiring process or issues with sourcing. Belonging Job satisfaction Compare job satisfaction or other survey responses for men and women, controlling for job position, tenure, and other relevant human capital characteristics. If women tend to be unhappier, it may indicate issues with culture, inclusion, or work-life balance. A discrepancy at the organization level (i.e., without controls) may indicate that women are represented in positions that lead to less job satisfaction, which could also be an issue. © HBR.org Phase 1: Compensation Standard analyses, especially of the gender pay gap, generally start by assigning each title to an ordered job level indicating where in the hierarchy a given position is located. The level corresponds to a specific pay band, with compensation increasing the higher up the hierarchy an employee moves. Tiers can then be assigned through the pyramid, with lower tiers representing entry-level positions and higher tiers representing the more senior positions. Plotting the employee headcount in each level reveals the approximate shape of the organization hierarchy, and a typical compensation discrimination analysis would ask whether women and men who are at the same level in the hierarchy are paid the same amount. But our analysis goes one step deeper and looks at where in the hierarchy women and men tend to be working in the first place. This was how we confirmed that the large disparities in compensation in the multinational company we were working with were due to an overrepresentation of men in the upper echelons of the organization, where obviously the compensation was substantially greater. Still, the importance of women’s representation in higher job positions extends beyond the resulting discrepancies in compensation. An employee’s position in the hierarchy is also linked to their responsibilities, prestige, power, and access. Representation, therefore, is a critical component of any gender equity analysis. Phase 2: Representation The representation of women across the organizational hierarchy is measured at a specific point in time. But any given representation clearly comes about as a result of the past movements in and out of each level. Women could be underrepresented at the top because they are less likely to be promoted, because they are more likely to exit from the highest positions, or because fewer of them are hired into top-ranking jobs in the first place — or, of course, some combination of the three. We assess each of these possibilities in turn. Given that discrepancies in the headcount may already exist, it’s not enough to compare promotion counts by gender. We need to track the promotion rates for employees who start in a given position. For men and women who start the year in the same job position, what fraction of each group ends up being promoted before the end of the year? The raw counts of women being promoted will of course be lower if women are already underrepresented in the headcount, but they may still be moving up at the same rate as their male counterparts. Indeed, that is what we found in the multinational company we studied. When we looked for discrepancies in turnover rates, we again found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Once they were in a given job position, men and women were equally likely to leave the company. Since the behavior and outcomes for men and women looked identical in terms of terminations and promotions, the gender discrepancies in the headcount must have arisen from discrepancies in hiring. In the multinational company we studied, we found that at the bottom tier, women represented 44% of hires made over the course of the year; at the top tier, women represented just 7% of hires. The proportion of women hired at each level nearly matched the proportion of women in the headcount — thus we confirmed that the gender composition of new hires was the primary source of underrepresentation of women at the top of the pyramid. The final critical question of course was whether this discrepancy was due to discrimination in hiring (i.e., the company was less likely to make offers to equally qualified women) or was the result of fewer female applicants being sourced. If it was a sourcing problem, we would need to ask about the current supply of female technologists with at least a decade of experience in order to understand the specific actions required to remedy this issue. Can they source more female applicants externally now, or do they need to focus on developing women within their organization over the long term? With detailed records of the organization’s job applicants, which in this case we unfortunately did not have access to, we could begin to formulate answers to these questions and identify the right course of action. Phase 3: Job Satisfaction As one final check for gender equity, we also examine whether women’s sense of happiness in their jobs diverges from that of men. Based on a survey administered early in the year of our study, in which employees reported on a scale from 1 to 10 how happy they were in their careers at this company, we found no significant difference between the happiness levels of men and women, controlling for their geography and title. Taken together, the evidence suggested that men and women were treated equitably in this organization once they were employed. The primary red flag for gender equity was that women were dramatically underrepresented in the more senior levels of the organization, where the source of this discrepancy was the gender composition of new hires. Using the methodology As we saw above in our analysis of the technology company, the framework outlined here helps us to diagnose gender inequities and point to next steps by zeroing in on the action-space. At each stage of the analysis — compensation, representation, and finally job satisfaction — the data reveals something about the nature of gender inequity. In the case of this multinational, our approach allowed us to identify the organization’s most important source of inequity as hiring. However, depending on the data, this methodology will clearly lead the analyst down different “rabbit holes” and suggest different conclusions. Similarly, the analysis could focus on racial equity instead of gender equity by examining differences between, say Black employees and white employees instead of between men and women. Using this methodology, companies will be able to make evidence-based decisions about whether to invest their equity budget in, for example, anti-bias and inclusion training to remedy a culture problem or a comprehensive compensation audit to address pay discrimination. As more executives start to ask important questions about their organization’s progress on gender equity, we hope this framework will help them decide what to measure, where to start, and ultimately lead them to take high-impact actions that result in a more equitable labor market.

Leadership 6 Leadership Paradoxes for the Post-Pandemic Era To thrive in an increasingly complex world, leaders will need to develop seemingly contradictory skill sets. by Paul Leinwand, Mahadeva Matt Mani, and Blair Sheppard by Paul Leinwand, Mahadeva Matt Mani, and Blair Sheppard April 23, 2021 Juan Moyano/Stocky Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. To succeed in the post-pandemic era, leaders need new skills and capabilities, leaders must be proficient across a wide set of paradoxical characteristics. Leaders must be strategic executors, balancing vision with execution. Second, they must be humble heroes, willing to make bold decisions while being great listeners and champions of inclusivity. Third, they must be tech-savvy humanists, adopting new technologies while understanding and caring for their people. Fourth, they must be traditioned innovators, preserving the mission and purpose of their companies while pushing innovation to the extreme. Fifth, they must be high-integrity politicians, willing to compromise, accrue support, and form coalitions while doing so with the utmost integrity. Finally, they must be globally-minded localists, expanding their reach while also looking for privileged insights into their own customers. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español The pandemic has accelerated a trend that has been unfolding over the last decade. As the world has grown more digital and complex, the range of decisions that leaders need to make has broadened, spanning from big picture strategic thinking to careful execution, to advancing technology roadmaps and upskilling and engaging employees. And decision-making criteria too have expanded, increasingly focusing on ESG considerations in addition to narrowly defined profit expectations. The past year has been particularly intense, pushing leaders to make decisions for which they had no previous experience — and do so quickly. To succeed in this new era of value creation, leaders need new skills and capabilities. Our in-depth research of more than a dozen companies that have transformed and positioned themselves for success in this new world — including Microsoft, the Cleveland Clinic, and Philips — shows that leaders at these companies sought to be proficient across a wide set of characteristics rather than relying solely on their areas of strengths. They learned how to work together with others who have different backgrounds and different ways of thinking, and they emphasized collaborating together to lead their business despite all their differences. (If you’re interested in participating in a survey about leadership, you can find more details at the end of this article.) The characteristics that leaders we interviewed considered most important in this new era align well with the six paradoxes of leadership described in Blair Sheppard’s recent book, Ten Years to Midnight. Strategic Executor Leaders who want to succeed in this complex and fast paced business environment need to have clarity about what the new world will look like and what their company’s place in that world is going to be. This requires highly strategic leaders, visionaries who can step back from the day to day to see where the world is headed, understand how value can be created in the future in ways that are different from today’s, and stake out a powerful position for the company. Being a good strategist, however, isn’t enough. Leaders need to be equally skilled at execution. They need to own the transformation of the company needed to reach the future. They need to be able to translate strategy into specific executional steps and see that execution through to the end. They need to be able to make rapid operational decisions that help deliver the path to the future. In many ways, the digital model of value creation may require even stronger execution skills than in the past, since there is so much to do to push the limits of what’s possible. Humble Hero The digital age calls for hero leaders, people who are willing to make bold decisions (like shedding certain business positions or staking out new ones) in times of uncertainty. At the same time leaders need to have the humility to acknowledge what they don’t know and to bring on board people with potentially very different skills, backgrounds, and capabilities. They need to be willing to learn from others who may have less leadership tenure, but more relevant insights. They need to be highly inclusive and great listeners to understand not only new technologies, but also new ways of doing things that are different from how they did it before. Tech-Savvy Humanist While in the past, leaders may have gotten away with delegating the company’s technology challenges to their Chief Information or Chief Digital Officer, that approach will no longer work. With technology being an essential enabler for almost everything a company does — innovation, product management, operations, sales, customer service, finance, or any other area — every leader needs to understand what technology can do for the company and how. At the same time, they also need to understand and care about people. They need to understand how technology impacts people’s lives and they need to help their people adapt to and adopt the many changes that technology will enforce. This means engaging people with a huge degree of empathy and authenticity — helping them to embrace the changes and co-own the transformation. Traditioned Innovator Company purpose and values have probably never been as important as they are today in a world of constant change and multiple disruptions. In the midst of uncertainty, having clarity of purpose and values helps guide organizations through their path to value creation and relevance. While leaders reimagine their company’s place in the world, they also need to be clear and grounded about who they are as a company. They need to be clear about the organization’s reason for being — its purpose and values — to guide how they will uniquely create value in a way that engages others in their ecosystems and is relevant in the future. At the same time, leaders need to innovate and try out new things — faster than at any time before. They need to have the courage to fail and allow others to fail as well. All this experimentation and innovation, however, must not be unbound — it must happen within the guardrails consistent with the company’s purpose. High-Integrity Politician In an ecosystem world where companies, institutions, and individuals must collaborate to create value, being able to accrue support, negotiate, form coalitions and partnerships, and overcome resistance is an essential leadership capability. Leaders need to make compromises, be flexible in tweaking their approach and go one step back to be able to move two steps forward. This way of operating, however, can only be successful if leaders establish trust and integrity as the bedrock of all their actions. Effective collaboration within ecosystems can only happen when the parties involved can trust one another. Customers are willing to share privileged insights and participate in ecosystems only when they can trust how their data is used and how they are treated. And integrity will be key for managing the increasing regulatory scrutiny many companies are going to see. In a data-driven economy, integrity and trust are essential foundational conditions. These are values that cannot come from a computer — they require human leaders to make deliberate choices measured by their actions and words. Globally-Minded Localist Technology has erased many boundaries and distances — it’s much easier now to reach customers on the other side of the globe and to collaborate with people from far apart. Almost by force, companies operating in the digital age need to think globally — even if only to gain access to insights and talent to serve local needs. This requires leaders who can think and engage globally, who will expose themselves to new thinking and work with people from all around. At the same time, leaders in the digital age also need to be deeply aware of and responsive to the situation and preferences of individual customers and to the local communities and ecosystems in which they operate. Customers, partners, and institutions expect companies to be responsive to their specific needs, and leaders will certainly have to adopt a locally conscious mindset. While this list is by no means exhaustive, we believe it provides a good starting guide to negotiate the era that lies ahead. The digital age and the magnitude of the transformation that is needed requires that leaders build on their strengths and expand their aperture to manage the complex world we’re living in. We believe those leaders who have the humility, courage and commitment to reinvent themselves will become the champions of the digital age. *** To help paint a better picture on the leadership behaviors and capabilities that will be important in the future, we invite you to participate in our 5 minute survey that seeks your views of what is important for you and your company.

A survival guide for the new, privacy-centric iOS 14.5. by Julian Runge and Eric Seufert by Julian Runge and Eric Seufert April 26, 2021 Normform/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. The rollout of Apple’s new privacy settings is upending the rules of digital advertising on the iOS platform. By limiting advertisers’ ability to track user behavior, Apple is forcing them to adapt to a new paradigm — and fast. As other tech companies may soon follow suit, this disruption is an opportunity for advertisers to prepare for the coming era. They should embrace new privacy preserving approaches; know that privacy workarounds are a short-term strategy at best; transition away from user-centric models; invest in better understanding their audience; and use ad creativity as a way of differentiating themselves from rivals. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Apple is turning the privacy settings of its mobile ecosystem upside down. When it releases its app tracking transparency (ATT) framework with iOS 14.5 on April 26, it will shut off a stream of data that app developers, measurement companies, and advertisers have used to link users’ behavior across apps and mobile websites — a move that could reshape the digital advertising industry. With the update, the “identifier for advertisers” (IDFA), which has been activated by default on Apple devices and provides access to user-level data to app publishers, will be switched off and users will need to grant apps explicit permission to access it. With in-app prompts asking users, “Allow [app name] to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites?” opt-in rates will likely be low. We anticipate that Apple’s ATT initiative will deliver a major blow to targeted advertising, which is crucial to the business models of publishers of online content such as Facebook, Google, and many news outlets. But while large digital content providers will feel the effects of ATT, the large proprietary datasets they’ve amassed may protect them in the long term. Smaller companies, such as e-commerce operations that rely on targeted advertising to reach customers, and mobile measurement providers, which collect and organize app data, will likely find it harder going — a point Facebook has tried to bring home in a campaign responding to Apple’s policy changes. Through the rollout of ATT, Apple is re-imagining the role that advertising plays within its ecosystem. The move will allow the company to more tightly control users’ app experiences and content curation. It will also allow Apple to push adoption of its own target advertising solution — its in-house ad tracking services use friendlier language than what is required of third-party apps and it recently introduced new ad spots on the App Store. Establishing itself as a leader in privacy can serve to strengthen its brand and have lasting positive effects on its hardware sales to boot. While ATT might be the most impactful change to the digital advertising ecosystem to date, more restrictions around user privacy are in the offing. Developments such as private click measurement (PCM), Google’s Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), the end of third-party cookies in Chrome, and governmental privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA all point to a new privacy-centric era on the horizon. That means that advertisers and advertising firms need to learn how to play by a new set of rules — and fast. Here’s a primer on how you can be prepared to navigate the changes. What ATT Changes Apple’s new approach to privacy presents a clear problem for advertisers who rely on targeted advertising — in other words, most digital advertisers — in that it will make it much harder to meaningfully link user behavior across apps and mobile websites in the iOS ecosystem. Depending on opt-in rates (which, again, are expected to be low), this presents a major challenge for advertising targeting algorithms that achieve their current good performance by observing not only what ads users view and click on, but also who then proceeds to take relevant actions on the website or in the app of the advertiser. Overall, ATT can be expected to make ads substantially less relevant for consumers and to make them perform substantially less well for advertisers — except for ads delivered by Apple’s own personalized ads system. It also reduces the precision of advertising measurement across iOS apps and mobile websites. Many industry insiders expect Google to make a similar change in the Android ecosystem at some point in the future, effectively rendering digital advertising less relevant across the board and its measurement much less granular and precise.* These changes in the digital measurement landscape roll back some of the innovations that became possible through digitization, namely precise measurement through user-level attribution and advertising experiments. To aid advertisers in navigating the limitation in data availability introduced by ATT, Apple is offering a measurement solution called SKAdNetwork (SKAN) that makes performance data available at the campaign level. However, not only is there a limit on the number of available campaign slots per advertiser, SKAN also adds a random time delay on the observation of performance events such as purchases or cart-adds and restricts how and how many of such events can be observed per campaign. SKAN falls within the sphere of differential privacy, an approach to marketing measurement that uses statistical methods to make it impossible to infer any individual user’s behavior while still allowing linking of behavior across different digital properties. Differential privacy is likely to become more prevalent. Other tech companies, such as Google, are investing significantly into such technologies as well but there may be a long way to go before wide acceptance and adoption as a new privacy-safe measurement approach. In the meantime, more traditional measurement solutions that are privacy-safe by default will likely stand to gain in relevance. For example, marketing mix models (MMMs) were developed on and for aggregate advertising and sales data observed over time and do not require any linking of lower-level tracking data. They make use of natural variation in a firm’s marketing mix or, where possible, of explicitly induced randomization over time and/or geographies to measure advertising effects. Bearing testament to the likely renaissance of MMMs in marketing measurement, Facebook published an open-source computational package that allows advertisers to implement MMMs in a guided manner. How You Can Adapt So what should advertisers and advertising firms do? We believe that internalizing the following strategic viewpoints can help businesses navigate this changing privacy landscape. 1) Embrace privacy preservation methodologies like differential privacy (Apple) and federated learning (Google). These are the primary means by which large platforms are ushering in new privacy protections for consumers — firms that are planning ahead should build advertising technology that aligns with them. When privacy policy changes, the biggest pain point for advertisers is infrastructure upgrades. This sea change should be seen as an opportunity to invest in new and innovative technologies that not only comply with platform regulations but do so in a way that is forward looking. New restraints on the data that can be used for measurement and analysis can create competitive advantage in moments of dramatic change, when competitors are reticent to invest or adapt. 2) Understand that workarounds to new privacy regulations are not a viable, long-term solution. It may seem relatively cheap or straightforward to build solutions that preserve advertising workflows and measurement schemas by sneakily contravening platform policies — using device fingerprinting or server-to-server conversion management — but taking this approach merely delays the inevitable pain of adaptation. A firm should make investments into real solutions, not gimmicks that exploit loopholes or are predicated on rules not being fully enforced, especially since the privacy landscape is currently mostly dictated by large platforms that mostly operate according to their own rules. 3) Transition advertising measurement away from deterministic, user-centric models. Instead, use more holistic, macro-level models that look at variations in ad spend and revenue over time to attribute efficiency to channel-specific ad campaigns. This approach requires sophisticated data-science expertise, and these types of models can be difficult to tune properly, but a measurement solution that relies on statistical sophistication is more robust and durable than one that relies on the precision of user identity. Tools like MMMs not only provide insight from data that is readily available and affirmable such as revenue and ad spend, but they also allow for traditional advertising channels such as television and out-of-home to be included in the advertising media mix and accommodated for in measurement. 4) Deepen your understanding of your audience and rely less on niche products. The products that suffer most in the loss of the identifier-based advertising targeting are those that target niche audiences and depend on very high rates of monetization participation, or very extreme levels of monetization from a small segment of the customer base. Building a more broadly appealing product is a strategy for overcoming the degradation of advertising effectiveness: The more people that are receptive to your product, the less targeted your ads must be in order to reach customers. 5) Get more creative and use it as a means of differentiation. Absent the targeting capabilities that are unlocked with device identifiers and behavioral histories, advertisers can focus on ad creative as a way to increase the reception their ads receive with potential customers. Novel, creative, and attractive ads can’t fully replace the efficiency lost in digital advertising from the deprecation of advertising identifiers, but it can help to reach the most relevant segment of an audience by penetrating through generic, nondescript advertising from competitors. With precision targeting largely removed from the advertiser’s toolbox, ad creative can be used as a way to stand out to the most appropriate portions of the broader audiences to which ads will be exposed. Apple’s ATT framework may be the most economically impactful and brazen change to privacy policy in years. It won’t be the only one, however. As this step is likely the start of a new era rather than an outlier event, we recommend using the opportunity to brush up on privacy technologies such as differential privacy and federated learning and to sustainably revamp your marketing measurement toolkit. *Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Google had announced a similar move in the Android ecosystem.

Fifth, they must be high-integrity politicians, willing to compromise, accrue support, and form coalitions while doing so with the utmost integrity. Finally, they must be globally-minded localists, expanding their reach while also looking for privileged insights into their own customers. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español The pandemic has accelerated a trend that has been unfolding over the last decade. As the world has grown more digital and complex, the range of decisions that leaders need to make has broadened, spanning from big picture strategic thinking to careful execution, to advancing technology roadmaps and upskilling and engaging employees. And decision-making criteria too have expanded, increasingly focusing on ESG considerations in addition to narrowly defined profit expectations. The past year has been particularly intense, pushing leaders to make decisions for which they had no previous experience — and do so quickly. To succeed in this new era of value creation, leaders need new skills and capabilities. Our in-depth research of more than a dozen companies that have transformed and positioned themselves for success in this new world — including Microsoft, the Cleveland Clinic, and Philips — shows that leaders at these companies sought to be proficient across a wide set of characteristics rather than relying solely on their areas of strengths. They learned how to work together with others who have different backgrounds and different ways of thinking, and they emphasized collaborating together to lead their business despite all their differences. (If you’re interested in participating in a survey about leadership, you can find more details at the end of this article.) The characteristics that leaders we interviewed considered most important in this new era align well with the six paradoxes of leadership described in Blair Sheppard’s recent book, Ten Years to Midnight. Strategic Executor Leaders who want to succeed in this complex and fast paced business environment need to have clarity about what the new world will look like and what their company’s place in that world is going to be. This requires highly strategic leaders, visionaries who can step back from the day to day to see where the world is headed, understand how value can be created in the future in ways that are different from today’s, and stake out a powerful position for the company. Being a good strategist, however, isn’t enough. Leaders need to be equally skilled at execution. They need to own the transformation of the company needed to reach the future. They need to be able to translate strategy into specific executional steps and see that execution through to the end. They need to be able to make rapid operational decisions that help deliver the path to the future. In many ways, the digital model of value creation may require even stronger execution skills than in the past, since there is so much to do to push the limits of what’s possible. Humble Hero The digital age calls for hero leaders, people who are willing to make bold decisions (like shedding certain business positions or staking out new ones) in times of uncertainty. At the same time leaders need to have the humility to acknowledge what they don’t know and to bring on board people with potentially very different skills, backgrounds, and capabilities. They need to be willing to learn from others who may have less leadership tenure, but more relevant insights. They need to be highly inclusive and great listeners to understand not only new technologies, but also new ways of doing things that are different from how they did it before. Tech-Savvy Humanist While in the past, leaders may have gotten away with delegating the company’s technology challenges to their Chief Information or Chief Digital Officer, that approach will no longer work. With technology being an essential enabler for almost everything a company does — innovation, product management, operations, sales, customer service, finance, or any other area — every leader needs to understand what technology can do for the company and how. At the same time, they also need to understand and care about people. They need to understand how technology impacts people’s lives and they need to help their people adapt to and adopt the many changes that technology will enforce. This means engaging people with a huge degree of empathy and authenticity — helping them to embrace the changes and co-own the transformation. Traditioned Innovator Company purpose and values have probably never been as important as they are today in a world of constant change and multiple disruptions. In the midst of uncertainty, having clarity of purpose and values helps guide organizations through their path to value creation and relevance. While leaders reimagine their company’s place in the world, they also need to be clear and grounded about who they are as a company. They need to be clear about the organization’s reason for being — its purpose and values — to guide how they will uniquely create value in a way that engages others in their ecosystems and is relevant in the future. At the same time, leaders need to innovate and try out new things — faster than at any time before. They need to have the courage to fail and allow others to fail as well. All this experimentation and innovation, however, must not be unbound — it must happen within the guardrails consistent with the company’s purpose. High-Integrity Politician In an ecosystem world where companies, institutions, and individuals must collaborate to create value, being able to accrue support, negotiate, form coalitions and partnerships, and overcome resistance is an essential leadership capability. Leaders need to make compromises, be flexible in tweaking their approach and go one step back to be able to move two steps forward. This way of operating, however, can only be successful if leaders establish trust and integrity as the bedrock of all their actions. Effective collaboration within ecosystems can only happen when the parties involved can trust one another. Customers are willing to share privileged insights and participate in ecosystems only when they can trust how their data is used and how they are treated. And integrity will be key for managing the increasing regulatory scrutiny many companies are going to see. In a data-driven economy, integrity and trust are essential foundational conditions. These are values that cannot come from a computer — they require human leaders to make deliberate choices measured by their actions and words. Globally-Minded Localist Technology has erased many boundaries and distances — it’s much easier now to reach customers on the other side of the globe and to collaborate with people from far apart. Almost by force, companies operating in the digital age need to think globally — even if only to gain access to insights and talent to serve local needs. This requires leaders who can think and engage globally, who will expose themselves to new thinking and work with people from all around. At the same time, leaders in the digital age also need to be deeply aware of and responsive to the situation and preferences of individual customers and to the local communities and ecosystems in which they operate. Customers, partners, and institutions expect companies to be responsive to their specific needs, and leaders will certainly have to adopt a locally conscious mindset. While this list is by no means exhaustive, we believe it provides a good starting guide to negotiate the era that lies ahead. The digital age and the magnitude of the transformation that is needed requires that leaders build on their strengths and expand their aperture to manage the complex world we’re living in. We believe those leaders who have the humility, courage and commitment to reinvent themselves will become the champions of the digital age. *** To help paint a better picture on the leadership behaviors and capabilities that will be important in the future, we invite you to participate in our 5 minute survey that seeks your views of what is important for you and your company.

Sales & Marketing Designing Customer Journeys for the Post-Pandemic World Three factors to consider. by Gene Cornfield by Gene Cornfield May 06, 2021 Sean Gladwell/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. While using customer journeys to guide what teams build and how they operate is common practice, small differences in approach produce vastly different results. But today, as we enter a new stage of profound change, those differences will be more important than ever to business performance. The author offers three simple but critical factors that will determine whether your post-pandemic customer journeys will help amplify or impede business growth. First, be customer-centric, not company-centric. Second, create flexible journeys based on need-points, not touchpoints. Third, measure (and optimize) customer journeys and experiences. Small and midsize businesses have a window of advantage here. While larger companies might have greater resources and reach and some have recognized the need to pivot their customer journeys, experiences, and operations for new realities, for many, forward progress will be mitigated by operational, organizational, and cultural inertia. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español As vaccinated millions step tentatively back into an in-person economy poised for growth, the relationships they had with companies they preferred before will resume — but on a trial basis. Spending loyalties will be cemented (or potentially lost to others) based on how well companies understand customers’ new priorities that were forged by the degree of uncertainty, fear, strife, or loss each individual experienced. These considerations will influence not only what customers choose but also how they go about choosing. Your customer journeys must change to reflect your customers’ new preferences and behaviors. While using customer journeys to guide what teams build and how they operate is common practice, small differences in approach produce vastly different results. But today, as we enter a new stage of profound change, those differences will be more important than ever to business performance. Companies that have adopted different approaches to customer journey and experience practices have seen more than six times greater growth in year-on-year profitability. Regardless of one’s industry, whether B2C or B2B, the following three simple but critical factors will determine whether your post-pandemic customer journeys will help amplify or impede business growth. Customer-Centric, Not Company-Centric Customers happily serve as the engine of business outcomes when doing so is a byproduct of achieving their own intended outcomes. Every time a customer achieves their purpose, the company that enabled them to do so receives revenue or some other value (loyalty, advocacy, etc.). Insight Center Collection Opportunities for Midsize Businesses in 2021 Set yourself up to thrive. But the vast majority of customer journeys I see focus on company outcomes. They guide marketing or sales or service teams, perhaps inadvertently, to manipulate customers toward a business outcome. This practice is so engrained that we have a name for it: The funnel. The least customer-centric companies often have a single customer journey that is essentially the vertical funnel turned on its side, like a livestock chute through which customers are prodded toward a fate of the company’s choosing. The corralling pens customers pass through — awareness, interest, evaluation, intent, purchase, loyalty — are all in the context of a product and what the company wants, not what customers want. Many other companies have recognized that customers engage in multiple journeys over the lifetime of their relationship; however, those different journeys are typically aligned to and named for specific outcomes, such as acquisition, retention, or upsell. The question for these companies is: Which customer segments wake up with a burning desire to be acquired? Which think their lives would be so much better if only they could be retained or upsold? These journeys, too, are entirely company-centric. Customer-centric journeys start and end with the outcome customers are trying to achieve: Their intended purpose. For example, the pandemic has spurred many people to relocate from cities to suburbs. Many are first-time homeowners, unsure what tools they might need for planned improvements or unplanned repairs. Some might want to build a treehouse with their kids but don’t yet have a specific model chosen or the plans, instructions, or tools to realize it. What new offerings, journeys, or experiences might manufacturers of power tools create to enable customers to achieve this purpose? A traditional journey might start with ads or emails with images of a family building a treehouse that link to the company home page, and then expect the customer to discern what tools or other things they need. Without further guidance, customers will likely leave the company’s site (and the company-designed journey) for a search engine, which provides links to numerous articles, blogs, or competitor sites — any of which might better help the customer achieve their purpose and, as a result, prompt them to purchase elsewhere. The company-designed journey might include stalking customers around the web with retargeting ads. But not only is this practice being phased out, it squanders marketing spend by trying to bring customers back to a site that doesn’t address key needs in their journey. A more customer-centric journey might start with the ads or emails described above, but link to a section of the company website organized by types of projects, from decks to sheds to treehouses. They might show multiple treehouse designs, filterable by size or the type of trees for which each is suitable. The detail page for each treehouse might show a video of the project from start to finish to build confidence in the customer and excitement among the family. All the tools and parts required might be listed, with options to buy them a la carte or as a full package. Each purchase might include assembly plans with illustrated instructions, and a mobile device–optimized step-by-step version, with guidance on what age child can handle each task so all family members can participate safely. Options for contactless delivery or curbside pickup at a local retail partner could be presented. The company might include an offer from a partner like DoorDash or Grubhub for lunch/refreshment delivery, to address that part of the journey. Companies can better drive growth by creating journeys that align with their customers’ purposes, then develop and operate experiences that enable customers to achieve them. This isn’t to say companies shouldn’t be trying to influence customer decisions along the way. Influence can be more effective when journeys and experiences are customer-centric, designed not as a path to purchase, but as a path to purpose. The tool company above influences purchases by designing an offer, journey, and experience that addresses customer purpose. They could influence future purchases by triggering an email a few weeks later asking customers how the treehouse project went or if they need help. Doing so demonstrates commitment to the customer’s purpose, which can influence loyalty and future purchases. If the email also encourages customers to post finished treehouse photos on Instagram (which can also appear on the webpage for that treehouse), the company aligns with customers’ desire to share family accomplishments, which might influence others to buy. This customer-centric, purpose-led approach is even more important for B2B companies. Longer buying cycles mean keeping prospects engaged in longer journeys with more interaction points. It’s also more challenging when decisions involve multiple people, each on their own journey, with varying purposes depending on their role. Marketing and sales teams can increase win rates by aligning individual journeys to each person’s purpose, while managing the group’s purposes collectively in a multi-buyer journey. Flexible Journeys Based on Need-Points, Not Touchpoints Customers have greater choice than ever before in terms of how and where they engage. And being forced in the last year to interact only via phone, websites, apps, chats, text, or social channels means customers are more comfortable with these methods than before. This democratization of new interaction channels has made it more important that customer journeys not be rigidly tied to specific touchpoints. For example, a customer journey that portrays a linear series of interactions — customer sees offline ad, then goes to search engine, then is directed to landing page on website, then is retargeted on Facebook, then comes back to website and provides email address, after which an email to customer is triggered, etc. — is only useful as an example of what could happen if all the stars aligned — or if customers were willing to follow the script. But customers don’t follow scripts. They follow impulses, urges, whims, and preferences, often in unplanned moments of opportunity. So it’s important that journeys are not aligned to specific touchpoints according to what the company wants to happen. Rather, the company should seek to understand the series of need-points customers traverse in order to make decisions that achieve whatever outcome they ultimately intend. For example, a person whose purpose is to quit smoking might traverse a journey of need-points, from understanding the easiest way to quit, which method is best for them, how fast it will work, where they can buy it, how quickly they can get it, and (once received) how they use it. Each customer might choose from a variety of touchpoints at each moment of need, depending on their preferences or context at that moment. It’s your job to be present with the content, expert, recommendation, answer, or product relevant to the customer need at that point, in any and all of the channels a customer might choose, including any operated by the company (website, app, chatbot, call center, salespeople, stores, branches, etc.) or by third parties (search engines, review sites, blogs, retail partners, etc.). The company that successively addresses these needs most relevantly, clearly, and quickly at any potential touchpoint is likely to maintain engagement and influence throughout each customer’s journey until each achieves their ultimate purpose — and generates value for the business. Measuring (and Optimizing) Customer Journeys and Experiences Company outcomes depend on the number of customers who successfully achieve their intended purpose. The better a company measures and manages how well they’re enabling customers to progress across need-points, the stronger the resulting business outcomes. Teams can measure the effectiveness of their customer journeys — and the experiences based on them — using Customer Performance Indicators (CPIs), which I’ve written about before. This method measures how well a company is performing for customers at each need-point. The better a company performs on outcomes important to customers (CPIs), the better it will perform on outcomes important to the company (KPIs). And because certain need-points in the journey will influence customer decisions more than others, companies should prioritize performing well on CPIs in these moments that matter. You may find that some need-points are specific to certain customer segments. So, while revising journeys and experiences for your largest or most valuable customer segments is advisable, catering to the unique needs or preferences of other segments should be added over time. Do this by creating off-ramps and on-ramps to and from your main journeys, as a map would depict side roads merging onto a major thoroughfare. For example, the simplified insurance journey from my previous article reflects three key need-points: Fast Quote, Best Price, and Payments That Fit My Budget. Some customers may need to understand the benefits of bundling home, auto, or other insurance policies before looking for a fast quote. So another need-point (and CPI) for Understanding Bundling Benefits might be added with an on-ramp to the main journey. This helps marketers ensure they have relevant content for the new need-point (at all touchpoints), and designers can ensure a more relevant and seamless experience for more customers, which results in more customers won. Looking Ahead If your company has already adopted these practices, you’re well-positioned to thrive. Simply refine your customer journeys and experiences for how customer needs and values have evolved. For those still using company-centric, linear journeys rigidly tied to specific touchpoints or measuring only business outcomes, now is the time a change in approach will pay off the most. Small and midsize businesses have a window of advantage here. While larger companies might have greater resources and reach and some have recognized the need to pivot their customer journeys, experiences, and operations for new realities, for many, forward progress will be mitigated by operational, organizational, and cultural inertia. So, until larger or slower players ultimately get there, opportunities abound for more nimble companies to better align with customers’ new purposes and forge new relationships that accelerate growth and strengthen loyalty by providing them with greater confidence in a still-uncertain world.

Managing people How to Set Up a Remote Employee for Success on Day One Four strategies for managers. by James M. Citrin and Darleen DeRosa by James M. Citrin and Darleen DeRosa May 10, 2021 Kei Uesugi/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Onboarding a remote employee is more challenging than doing it in-person. The goals, however, remain the same: To help the employee get off to a fast start, build relationships, understand the culture, and recognize expectations. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Most managers know that onboarding new employees virtually is just plain hard, and many recognize the long-term impact a poor onboarding experience could have on their employees. Onboarding is more than logistics, such as making sure your new employee has a computer. The more critical, make-or-break parts of onboarding include: Getting off to a fast start to give your new colleague early comfort and confidence — making him or her feel welcome. Establishing a foundation for strong relationships across the organization. Building an understanding of the culture and how work gets done. Setting clear expectations and connecting the individual’s work to the broader organizational mission, vision, and goals. It turns out that the biggest barrier to creating an intentional, differentiated onboarding experience is often mindset. In the same way it took television time to find the best ways to exploit the new medium (and grow beyond the earliest TV shows, which were really just radio shows filmed with cameras), so too will companies need to develop onboarding programs that are tailored to the times and the technology. Insight Center Collection Opportunities for Midsize Businesses in 2021 Set yourself up to thrive. Whether a company is small and onboards new employees one at a time, or is a larger firm that brings in bigger cohorts of new hires that go through onboarding together, the following four recommendations can help onboarding programs succeed: 1. Get off to a fast start. Think about your first day at your current job. You probably didn’t sleep well the night before. Your mind was spinning with anticipation, doubt, and uncertainty. This may be especially true if you were starting a new job in the ambiguity of a virtual environment. The few moments of comfort that would typically present themselves in the early day — the quick bonding with a colleague in the hallway, or your new boss or teammates taking you out to lunch — aren’t available in a remote context. It is also unlikely that a new employee joining your organization today has ever experienced a fully virtual onboarding process, since even companies with remote workforces frequently opted to do their onboarding in-person before the pandemic. With this sensitivity in mind, create a plan to leverage a variety of strategies that can mitigate first-day nerves and allow your employees to feel welcome and gain confidence from the start. Identify, appoint, and communicate a dedicated onboarding liaison. Even in the office, it’s a good idea to have someone fill the role of informal mentor to support a new hire, but it’s even more critical remotely because the new leader won’t have colleagues around to spontaneously ask questions as they come up. It’s important that this informal mentor be a different person from the person’s manager, so that the new employee feels comfortable asking any question, large or small. Any new employee will and should have endless questions, and the last thing you want is having them feel uncertain about who to ask. Ideally, the onboarding liaison will proactively reach out to the new employee prior to the first day and establish themselves as the new individual’s go-to person. Create a connection to the company before the first day. As soon as a candidate accepts the job offer, find an opportunity to make them feel a part of the family. Reckitt, the global consumer products company, sends a care package to new employees’ homes before their start date. It’s filled with the company’s products, and a warm note linking the products to the company’s mission. Set up technology before the start date. Offering each new employee a session with IT to show him or her how the videoconferencing platform, communication channels, and other company systems work can alleviate first-day anxiety. Doing this before the start date minimizes technical issues and allows new employees to be fully present and more comfortable on day one. Some organizations send new employees a new laptop and or phone before the start date, fully set up with the right company configurations and security protocols. This creates a connection to the organization and reduces new employee anxiety. 2. Establish strong relationships across the organization. In a virtual setting, you can’t rely as much on the organic and spontaneous relationship-building that happens in hallways, over lunches, and at office events. That’s why it’s best to be proactive and intentional about setting up a mix of formal and informal one-on-one interactions between the new hire and other individuals. Additionally, it’s important to organize a mix of different group discussions so that the new hire can develop contextual understanding of team dynamics. Lastly, one risk of virtual work is that it can make it easy for an individual or leader to operate in silos or with the same network of people on a regular basis. Creating both a strong core network and a broader network across the organization will allow the executive to be more successful long-term. To do this, create a blended series of informal and formal experiences that aim to create community and build in touchpoints. Build strong 1:1 relationships. To combat the lack of spontaneous opportunities for small talk and other relationship building that would typically happen in an office, encourage your new hire and their teammates to set up a mix of formal conversations, to cover rules, responsibilities, and business objectives, and shorter, informal interactions over coffee, lunch, or debriefing on a recent meeting. Just as in virtual interviewing, one advantage of virtual onboarding is the general availability of colleagues over video, so these meetings should be readily easy to schedule. Recognize team dynamics and build a broader network. Research shows that it’s more powerful to have a broad network than a deep network, especially as one becomes increasingly senior in an organization. Particularly when a new leader onboards, the organization should help him or her intentionally build a broad network, starting internally. While one-on-one meetings are powerful for establishing foundational relationships, trust and rapport, having your new hire begin sitting in on group discussions from day one can help this person put individuals into the context of how work gets done. Some companies set up a “shadow week” in which the new hire attends a wide variety of team and stakeholder group meetings, even those that may feel less directly relevant to that new hire’s core responsibilities. 3. Explain the company culture and how work gets done. New employees must learn about the company’s culture from the outset. Spend more time than you generally would in a face-to-face environment talking about what is typical and atypical across various cultural dimensions. Create the space for your new colleagues to ask about the way things are done as well. Make unspoken assumptions explicit. Many organizations rely on organic ways of communicating shared history and norms. Whether virtually or not, memorializing a company’s history in videos, in the “about us” section of your website, and in documents can help accelerate a process that might otherwise take longer to capture over a series of many interactions with longstanding members of the organization. Even if it feels awkward, explicit guidance around norms that are often taken for granted — the company’s tone and level of formality, dress code, virtual etiquette on videoconferences, messaging norms, and working hours — can be helpful. Don’t leave new employees to guess at these issues; doing so can create ambiguity and stress. Designate a culture buddy. Assigning an individual whom the new employee can go to with questions about the culture can be especially effective. The buddy might debrief after an important group discussion, flagging to the new employee on actions that aren’t in line with the culture or how his or her style may be perceived by others. 4. Set clear expectations and connect the individual’s work to the broader organizational mission, vision, and goals. A new hire should have a clear picture of what success looks like for the first 100 days and beyond. New hires should recognize how their responsibilities fit into the overall success of the company. When an individual joins the team, the hiring manager should share key communications and presentations that have been done by the leadership of the organization on the direction and goals of the company so the new hire can put his or her work into the context of the whole. Having a clear set of responsibilities and outcomes can be critical to helping a new employee prioritize and sequence work and accomplish some quick wins that create a strong foundation and momentum for the individual’s future success. Over the long term, while a role can evolve, adapt, and become more complex and ambiguous, having clarity from the start will create a foundation from which the individual can more readily adapt. Onboarding is one of the most important drivers of employee success. Getting off to a strong start creates momentum. Getting off to a poor start breaks a new employee’s confidence and leads the organization to question the wisdom of the hire. What separates firms that do onboarding best — whether in-person or virtual — is that the work is intentional, and it does not end after the first week, the first 30 days, or even the first 100 days. Your onboarding program should just be the beginning of an ongoing developmental foundation that continues to strengthen your employees’ cultural alignment, relationships across your organization, and performance in their role.

Sales & Marketing Designing Customer Journeys for the Post-Pandemic World Three factors to consider. by Gene Cornfield by Gene Cornfield May 06, 2021 Sean Gladwell/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. While using customer journeys to guide what teams build and how they operate is common practice, small differences in approach produce vastly different results. But today, as we enter a new stage of profound change, those differences will be more important than ever to business performance. The author offers three simple but critical factors that will determine whether your post-pandemic customer journeys will help amplify or impede business growth. First, be customer-centric, not company-centric. Second, create flexible journeys based on need-points, not touchpoints. Third, measure (and optimize) customer journeys and experiences. Small and midsize businesses have a window of advantage here. While larger companies might have greater resources and reach and some have recognized the need to pivot their customer journeys, experiences, and operations for new realities, for many, forward progress will be mitigated by operational, organizational, and cultural inertia. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español As vaccinated millions step tentatively back into an in-person economy poised for growth, the relationships they had with companies they preferred before will resume — but on a trial basis. Spending loyalties will be cemented (or potentially lost to others) based on how well companies understand customers’ new priorities that were forged by the degree of uncertainty, fear, strife, or loss each individual experienced. These considerations will influence not only what customers choose but also how they go about choosing. Your customer journeys must change to reflect your customers’ new preferences and behaviors. While using customer journeys to guide what teams build and how they operate is common practice, small differences in approach produce vastly different results. But today, as we enter a new stage of profound change, those differences will be more important than ever to business performance. Companies that have adopted different approaches to customer journey and experience practices have seen more than six times greater growth in year-on-year profitability. Regardless of one’s industry, whether B2C or B2B, the following three simple but critical factors will determine whether your post-pandemic customer journeys will help amplify or impede business growth. Customer-Centric, Not Company-Centric Customers happily serve as the engine of business outcomes when doing so is a byproduct of achieving their own intended outcomes. Every time a customer achieves their purpose, the company that enabled them to do so receives revenue or some other value (loyalty, advocacy, etc.). Insight Center Collection Opportunities for Midsize Businesses in 2021 Set yourself up to thrive. But the vast majority of customer journeys I see focus on company outcomes. They guide marketing or sales or service teams, perhaps inadvertently, to manipulate customers toward a business outcome. This practice is so engrained that we have a name for it: The funnel. The least customer-centric companies often have a single customer journey that is essentially the vertical funnel turned on its side, like a livestock chute through which customers are prodded toward a fate of the company’s choosing. The corralling pens customers pass through — awareness, interest, evaluation, intent, purchase, loyalty — are all in the context of a product and what the company wants, not what customers want. Many other companies have recognized that customers engage in multiple journeys over the lifetime of their relationship; however, those different journeys are typically aligned to and named for specific outcomes, such as acquisition, retention, or upsell. The question for these companies is: Which customer segments wake up with a burning desire to be acquired? Which think their lives would be so much better if only they could be retained or upsold? These journeys, too, are entirely company-centric. Customer-centric journeys start and end with the outcome customers are trying to achieve: Their intended purpose. For example, the pandemic has spurred many people to relocate from cities to suburbs. Many are first-time homeowners, unsure what tools they might need for planned improvements or unplanned repairs. Some might want to build a treehouse with their kids but don’t yet have a specific model chosen or the plans, instructions, or tools to realize it. What new offerings, journeys, or experiences might manufacturers of power tools create to enable customers to achieve this purpose? A traditional journey might start with ads or emails with images of a family building a treehouse that link to the company home page, and then expect the customer to discern what tools or other things they need. Without further guidance, customers will likely leave the company’s site (and the company-designed journey) for a search engine, which provides links to numerous articles, blogs, or competitor sites — any of which might better help the customer achieve their purpose and, as a result, prompt them to purchase elsewhere. The company-designed journey might include stalking customers around the web with retargeting ads. But not only is this practice being phased out, it squanders marketing spend by trying to bring customers back to a site that doesn’t address key needs in their journey. A more customer-centric journey might start with the ads or emails described above, but link to a section of the company website organized by types of projects, from decks to sheds to treehouses. They might show multiple treehouse designs, filterable by size or the type of trees for which each is suitable. The detail page for each treehouse might show a video of the project from start to finish to build confidence in the customer and excitement among the family. All the tools and parts required might be listed, with options to buy them a la carte or as a full package. Each purchase might include assembly plans with illustrated instructions, and a mobile device–optimized step-by-step version, with guidance on what age child can handle each task so all family members can participate safely. Options for contactless delivery or curbside pickup at a local retail partner could be presented. The company might include an offer from a partner like DoorDash or Grubhub for lunch/refreshment delivery, to address that part of the journey. Companies can better drive growth by creating journeys that align with their customers’ purposes, then develop and operate experiences that enable customers to achieve them. This isn’t to say companies shouldn’t be trying to influence customer decisions along the way. Influence can be more effective when journeys and experiences are customer-centric, designed not as a path to purchase, but as a path to purpose. The tool company above influences purchases by designing an offer, journey, and experience that addresses customer purpose. They could influence future purchases by triggering an email a few weeks later asking customers how the treehouse project went or if they need help. Doing so demonstrates commitment to the customer’s purpose, which can influence loyalty and future purchases. If the email also encourages customers to post finished treehouse photos on Instagram (which can also appear on the webpage for that treehouse), the company aligns with customers’ desire to share family accomplishments, which might influence others to buy. This customer-centric, purpose-led approach is even more important for B2B companies. Longer buying cycles mean keeping prospects engaged in longer journeys with more interaction points. It’s also more challenging when decisions involve multiple people, each on their own journey, with varying purposes depending on their role. Marketing and sales teams can increase win rates by aligning individual journeys to each person’s purpose, while managing the group’s purposes collectively in a multi-buyer journey. Flexible Journeys Based on Need-Points, Not Touchpoints Customers have greater choice than ever before in terms of how and where they engage. And being forced in the last year to interact only via phone, websites, apps, chats, text, or social channels means customers are more comfortable with these methods than before. This democratization of new interaction channels has made it more important that customer journeys not be rigidly tied to specific touchpoints. For example, a customer journey that portrays a linear series of interactions — customer sees offline ad, then goes to search engine, then is directed to landing page on website, then is retargeted on Facebook, then comes back to website and provides email address, after which an email to customer is triggered, etc. — is only useful as an example of what could happen if all the stars aligned — or if customers were willing to follow the script. But customers don’t follow scripts. They follow impulses, urges, whims, and preferences, often in unplanned moments of opportunity. So it’s important that journeys are not aligned to specific touchpoints according to what the company wants to happen. Rather, the company should seek to understand the series of need-points customers traverse in order to make decisions that achieve whatever outcome they ultimately intend. For example, a person whose purpose is to quit smoking might traverse a journey of need-points, from understanding the easiest way to quit, which method is best for them, how fast it will work, where they can buy it, how quickly they can get it, and (once received) how they use it. Each customer might choose from a variety of touchpoints at each moment of need, depending on their preferences or context at that moment. It’s your job to be present with the content, expert, recommendation, answer, or product relevant to the customer need at that point, in any and all of the channels a customer might choose, including any operated by the company (website, app, chatbot, call center, salespeople, stores, branches, etc.) or by third parties (search engines, review sites, blogs, retail partners, etc.). The company that successively addresses these needs most relevantly, clearly, and quickly at any potential touchpoint is likely to maintain engagement and influence throughout each customer’s journey until each achieves their ultimate purpose — and generates value for the business. Measuring (and Optimizing) Customer Journeys and Experiences Company outcomes depend on the number of customers who successfully achieve their intended purpose. The better a company measures and manages how well they’re enabling customers to progress across need-points, the stronger the resulting business outcomes. Teams can measure the effectiveness of their customer journeys — and the experiences based on them — using Customer Performance Indicators (CPIs), which I’ve written about before. This method measures how well a company is performing for customers at each need-point. The better a company performs on outcomes important to customers (CPIs), the better it will perform on outcomes important to the company (KPIs). And because certain need-points in the journey will influence customer decisions more than others, companies should prioritize performing well on CPIs in these moments that matter. You may find that some need-points are specific to certain customer segments. So, while revising journeys and experiences for your largest or most valuable customer segments is advisable, catering to the unique needs or preferences of other segments should be added over time. Do this by creating off-ramps and on-ramps to and from your main journeys, as a map would depict side roads merging onto a major thoroughfare. For example, the simplified insurance journey from my previous article reflects three key need-points: Fast Quote, Best Price, and Payments That Fit My Budget. Some customers may need to understand the benefits of bundling home, auto, or other insurance policies before looking for a fast quote. So another need-point (and CPI) for Understanding Bundling Benefits might be added with an on-ramp to the main journey. This helps marketers ensure they have relevant content for the new need-point (at all touchpoints), and designers can ensure a more relevant and seamless experience for more customers, which results in more customers won. Looking Ahead If your company has already adopted these practices, you’re well-positioned to thrive. Simply refine your customer journeys and experiences for how customer needs and values have evolved. For those still using company-centric, linear journeys rigidly tied to specific touchpoints or measuring only business outcomes, now is the time a change in approach will pay off the most. Small and midsize businesses have a window of advantage here. While larger companies might have greater resources and reach and some have recognized the need to pivot their customer journeys, experiences, and operations for new realities, for many, forward progress will be mitigated by operational, organizational, and cultural inertia. So, until larger or slower players ultimately get there, opportunities abound for more nimble companies to better align with customers’ new purposes and forge new relationships that accelerate growth and strengthen loyalty by providing them with greater confidence in a still-uncertain world.

They’re up 150% in 2020 — and growing even faster in 2021. by Brenda R. Sharton by Brenda R. Sharton May 20, 2021 David Muir/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. These are unprecedented times in the world of cybersecurity, with ransomware attacks up 150% in 2020 and growing even faster in 2021. Most audit committees and senior management who have to make decisions around cyberattack say they never imagined they’d be in a discussion on whether and how much ransom to pay to hackers who are holding the company hostage. With good preparation and cybersecurity hygiene, and a plan in place, your company will reduce risk and be better prepared to deal with the unthinkable. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español With the migration to remote work over the last year, cyberattacks have increased exponentially. We saw more attacks of every kind, but the headline for 2020 was ransom attacks, which were up 150% over the previous year. The amount paid by victims of these attacks increased more than 300% in 2020. Already 2021 has seen a dramatic increase in this activity, with high-profile ransom attacks against critical infrastructure, private companies, and municipalities grabbing headlines on a daily basis. The amount of ransom demanded also has significantly increased this year, with some demands reaching tens of millions of dollars. And the attacks have become more sophisticated, with threat actors seizing sensitive company data and holding it hostage for payment. Who’s behind the recent surge in attacks? And how should companies respond to this increased threat? In this article, I’ll outline how ransomware attacks have evolved and what actions companies can take now to protect themselves. How Ransomware Attacks Have Changed A few years ago, the majority of ransom attacks involved only the deployment of ransomware. Hackers would gain access through a phishing email that would deploy malware when an unwitting employee clicked on a link. The malware would then encrypt company servers, and the extortionist would offer decryption keys in exchange for a ransom — typically in the five or sometimes six figures. Many times, the threat actors didn’t even gain access to company information — and sometimes they didn’t even know which company would be the ultimate target. They merely looked for systems to exploit and waited for the pay day. Once the ransom was paid — via Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency — the hackers would send decryption keys to gain access to their servers and even promise not to target the company again. The game has changed more recently — and has become a massive business for those who perpetrate these acts. According to Hiscox, Ltd., 43% of the more than 6,000 companies it surveyed had suffered a cyberattack in 2020 — up 38% in the 12 months before — and one in six of those attacks was a ransom attack. In 2020, the amount of ransom demanded grew to the mid to high seven-figure ranges, At the end of 2020 and into 2021, we have seen some ransom demands reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. In addition to the higher demands, the methodology has changed. Attacks are focused on exfiltrating company information — and the more sensitive, the better. These threat actors, who are often highly organized criminal organizations in eastern Europe and elsewhere, have done their research. They understand the company’s financial picture, the industry in which it operates, and how to exploit the company to maximum effect. In addition to deploying malware to encrypt company systems — targeting even the backup systems that are in place — the threat actors conduct reconnaissance of company files, ultimately exfiltrating large amounts of data, a terabyte in many instances. The threat actor then follows up with a “pay up or else” ultimatum, contacting the company with an extortion demand, to be paid in cryptocurrency, to obtain the decryption keys and to keep the company’s data private. The company is warned that should they choose not to pay, their sensitive information will be posted on the dark web on a “wall of shame” with others who were hacked and didn’t pay the ransom. Journalists who monitor the dark web can pick up this information and report more widely on the attack, sometimes causing damage to a company’s reputation or exposing valuable intellectual property or other confidential information, including customer and employee data. The company is left between a rock and a hard place — either pay millions of dollars in ransom to criminals or have sensitive and valuable confidential information publicly exposed. Notably, there does appear to be “honor among thieves” in the system. These extortionists depend upon companies believing that if they pay, all copies of the stolen files will be destroyed and/or the decryption keys provided. And the attackers do keep their word. In fact, some of these organizations are downright customer-service oriented, for example, accommodating the preferred cryptocurrency of the extortionee (with a small percentage upcharge to do so). We have even seen a threat actor “throw in” the decryption keys as a goodwill gesture, even though the company had already negotiated a lower ransom based upon the fact that it didn’t need the keys. What Should a Company Do If Attacked? In the event of a ransomware or other cyber extortion event, companies should follow their written incident response plan, in particular notifying senior management and the legal department. Looping in an attorney from the start will ensure that the investigation is protected by attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine, reducing the risk of exposure in any class-action lawsuits or other legal claims that may be brought in the wake of the data breach. The company’s insurance carrier also must be notified at the outset so that it can determine whether there is coverage under the applicable cyber insurance policy. The offer to pay ransom must be pre-approved by the insurance carrier prior to any communication to the threat actor. The decision whether to pay a ransom rests with senior management and often the board. Every ransomware or cyber extortion event must be assessed individually as to whether to pay or not. Keep an open mind: Often, companies lose precious time as decision makers unacquainted with ransom attacks vow on day one that the company will “never, ever” pay, then come around to the realities of the situation, the availability of insurance money, and the need to protect stakeholders before ultimately deciding to pay. In addition, keep calm and buy time. Threat actors try to create urgency and panic with their demands. Slowing things down is helpful in making the right decisions for your organization. Key questions to consider when deciding whether to pay ransom include: How sensitive is the information that has been accessed or exfiltrated? Does the company have back-ups of the information, or does it need the decryption keys? Do the costs of refusal, such as business disruption, the impact to systems or customers, negative publicity or reputational harm, exceed the ransom demand? Is the threat actor tied to a company that is on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned-entity list? (If so, it may be illegal under U.S. law to pay the ransom.) Depending on the severity of the incident and other factors, at the least most companies will file an online report with the FBI reporting the indicators of compromise (IOCs) involved in the attack to assist law enforcement in tracking these threat groups and hopefully someday bringing them to justice. So far, indictments in this area have been nearly non-existent and American companies have been left largely on their own to thwart these attacks, despite good intentions from law enforcement. How Can Companies Reduce the Risk? There are a number of steps that companies can take to reduce the risk of a ransom attack, as well as the risk of damage if an attack occurs. These include: Review your company’s incident response plan to be sure that in the event of an attack, it’s clear who is responsible for what actions. Review your company’s cyber insurance policy and be sure that ransom is covered and that the level of coverage reflects the current reality. Be sure multi-factor authentication is enabled on all company accounts, including service accounts and social media accounts, and that strong spam filters are in place. Establish a communication channel on a secure texting app so that senior management can communicate in the event of a cyberattack that takes down company email systems. Train your employees to identify phishing emails and educate them on the modus operandi of threat actors seeking to dupe them into clicking on links. Identify high-risk employees, such as those with administrative rights to systems, who might help perpetrate an insider attack. Assess the need for a prophylactic threat hunt by a reputable forensic firm engaged by counsel for privilege. For example, many companies treated the migration to a work from home environment as a “data security event” that would warrant a threat hunt of the system. Assess the cybersecurity programs and protocols for your key vendors — particularly any entity that handles sensitive or critical company data. Test back-up systems regularly and make sure they’re segregated from other company systems. These are unprecedented times in the world of cybersecurity. Most audit committees and senior management who have to make decisions around a ransom attack say they never imagined they would be in a discussion on whether and how much ransom to pay to hackers who are holding the company hostage. With good preparation and cybersecurity hygiene, and a plan in place, your company will reduce risk and be better prepared to deal with the unthinkable.

Security & privacy How Organizations Can Ramp Up Their Cybersecurity Efforts Right Now Scams and attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated as the crisis unfolds. by Brenda R. Sharton by Brenda R. Sharton May 01, 2020 HBR Staff/Image Source/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Cyberattacks have increased in both frequency and sophistication since the pandemic began as threat actors seek to take advantage of the unusual circumstances under which nearly all of us are working. Once a cyberattack occurs, companies largely are on their own to deal with the aftermath, so companies should take these seven steps to ensure they’re ready: 1) Review your incident response plan, 2) Stay up to date on current scams, 3) Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere, 4) Educate your employees, 5) Determine an alternative method for senior leadership to communicate, 6) Password protect your videoconferences, and 7) Check your cyber-insurance policy.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Prior to Covid-19, most companies perceived their worst-case cybersecurity scenario as a computer virus that would shut down company computer systems. In fact, just the opposite happened: a human virus has forced virtually entire workforces online, making companies more reliant than ever on their systems. The stakes of protecting those systems from a cyberattack could not be higher. In the words of the old American Express commercial: “What will you do? What will you do?” Over the past several weeks, we’ve observed that cyberattacks have increased at a rate of three to five times compared to pre-Covid. Phishing attempts have increased in both frequency and sophistication as threat actors seek to take advantage of the unusual circumstances under which nearly all of us are working. Scams focusing on treatments and cures for the novel coronavirus have been rampant — one recent operation by Interpol against fake Covid-19 “cure” sellers resulted in 121 arrests. Thousands of fraudulent coronavirus-themed websites are sprouting up per day. And Zoom, having skyrocketed in popularity, has experienced such a surge in videoconference hijacking that it has its own name, “Zoom-bombing.” Once a cyberattack occurs, companies largely are on their own. They have to scramble to counteract the attack and ensure that the threat actor is out of the system. They then may have to navigate industry regulators, while also trying to steer clear of the dreaded post-breach class action suit. What is a company to do? 1. Review your incident response plan. Every company should have an up-to-date, written plan in the event of an attack. It should be crystal clear as to who is to do what, who you will call for outside assistance, what the lines and protocols on communication will be within the company (such as board notification). This will protect the company from the confusion and early mistakes that often are made and that waste precious time in a crisis. In this environment, having a paper copy of the plan handy at home is also a good idea in the event of a systems breach. The chief privacy officer at one large financial institution recently told us that the last thing he did before he left the office for the quarantine was to grab a paper copy of the company’s incident response plan. 2. Stay up to date on current scams. Make sure all employees are aware of the most current scams and that your information security program has prepared a defense. Right now, the most ubiquitous is the “business email interruption” scam, where Office 365 or Gmail accounts are hacked via a phishing email. If an employee clicks on a bogus link, the cybercriminal has complete access to their inbox and can download malware onto their system. Sophisticated threat actors will most often target senior leadership or those with payment authority. By studying the contents of the particular inbox, the hacker is then able to gin up a very convincing fraudulent invoice purporting to be from a legitimate vendor, with changed wiring instructions so that the money is diverted to the hacker’s account and not to the legitimate recipient. While most of these attacks are “smash and grab” attempts to divert funds, in recent weeks, some criminals have focused instead on obtaining confidential company information — particularly with companies that may be working on breakthrough technology or cutting-edge health care products, sometimes for competitive purposes or sale on the dark web, among other things. With virtually all employees working remotely and the ordinary course of operations disrupted, this type of fraud is more likely to succeed, and the hackers know it. 3. Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere. Fortunately, there is a fairly effective tool to reduce the risk. Enabling MFA will stop all but the most sophisticated threat actors and it should be used on all accounts that are used by the company, not just administrative accounts. Remind employees to utilize MFA on their own devices as well. In one recent attack, a health care platform had MFA on its company systems but had failed to enable it on its Instagram account. The account was taken over by hackers for several hours while the criminals posted content and intercepted the direct messages of customers, among other things. 4. Educate your employees. Make sure your employees know that phishing attempts are on the rise and special care is needed as hackers try to take advantage of the crisis and a disrupted workplace. Cybercriminals will play to emotions. If it seems too good to be true, it is. If it is not a sender with whom they would normally interact, or a platform on which that person would communicate, they need to be on high alert. The CEO of the company is not likely to reach out to them and ask them to do something if he or she has never done so before, and especially not on a platform like LinkedIn or WhatsApp. Remind employees that if there is any question about the validity of an email, they should contact the sender via telephone — and make sure to use existing contact information, not the number on the email in question. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Be sure that anyone within the company in a position to send money out the door knows to be on high alert and not to wire any money or make any payment off of changed instructions without calling first. You can reduce the risk even further by wiring one dollar, and then calling your vendor to make sure it was received before sending the rest. Hackers have gotten so bold that in one recent fraud, they wrote in an email that they understood that they were asking for a large amount and so “Joe would call the company to confirm first.” The hacker himself called into the company to verify that the payment was “legitimate.” It wasn’t. 5. Determine an alternative method for senior leadership to communicate. If the unthinkable does happen and an attack brings down your company systems, how will senior leadership communicate among themselves and with employees? It is important to have an alternative means of communication ready to go so as not to lose precious time in a crisis. A regular text may be compromised — if a hacker has access to the company systems, it is easy for them to be able to set up a mechanism to intercept texts from the cell phones of senior managers. Consider setting up a secure texting app chain in advance so that a secure line of communication is ready, especially among those who will need to manage the breach if the normal email system is disrupted or compromised. 6. Password-protect your videoconferences. “Zoom-bombing” has become so rampant that the FBI has issued a warning. Recent cases involve unwanted guests shouting profanity and displaying other inappropriate content. To protect your videoconferences, do not post the link publicly. Make sure to require a meeting password, share the link and password only with authorized guests, and lock the meeting after it begins. Finally, if the content of your Zoom meeting is especially sensitive, consider doing an old-fashioned conference call instead. 7. Check your cyber-insurance policy. Do you have good cyber-insurance? These policies have become more comprehensive and cover more than they did a few years ago. Contact your broker now to determine what is “market” in your industry. You want to be negotiating that policy before you have an incident, not in the midst of one or just after. A good cyber policy will cover most costs associated with a data breach including counsel to guide you through the crisis, a forensic firm to come in (under the direction of counsel so as to be sure the work done is protected by attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrines) and, in many cases, even for ransom that the company pays to unencrypt its data. Given current conditions, the work from home paradigm is not likely to end anytime soon. Cybercriminals are notorious for their ability to adapt their malware and scams to meet companies’ defenses. It is an arms race to stay ahead of them. Staying up to date and keeping your workforce informed on the latest scams will help reduce the risk for your company.

Sales How Midsize B2B Sales Teams Can Punch Above Their Weight What they lack in scale they can make up for in flexibility. by Andris A. Zoltners, PK Sinha, and Sally E. Lorimer by Andris A. Zoltners, PK Sinha, and Sally E. Lorimer May 18, 2021 French Anderson Ltd/Stocksy Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. Although large companies have the advantage of scale, sales forces at midsize companies can compete by scaling digital and virtual sales capabilities, customizing selling to customer needs, adapting the sales organization as markets evolve, and using data and tools to support sales force decisions and processes. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Product differentiation and timeliness create the foundation for sales success. (Zoom’s takeoff is a visible example.) But today, customer buying processes are in flux. As buyer preferences for digital, virtual, and in-person interaction evolve, sales organizations must adapt. Success requires combining the power of salespeople with digital assets that arm, supplement, and sometimes replace salespeople. Large organizations can rise to the occasion by leveraging their scale. Midsize organizations can punch above their weight by countering with speed and flexibility, while supplementing their own capabilities with outsourced digital resources. For sales organizations of all sizes, four related challenges are involved: Scaling digital and virtual sales capabilities Customizing selling to customer needs, knowledge, and preferences Adapting the sales organization as markets evolve Using data and tools to support sales force decisions and processes Challenge #1: Scaling digital and virtual sales capabilities Sales organizations are boosting the use of digital and virtual sales channels to meet the needs of increasingly digitally fluent buyers. Insight Center Collection Opportunities for Midsize Businesses in 2021 Set yourself up to thrive. Growth in digital and virtual selling levels the playing field for sales organizations of all sizes. Thanks to a plethora of outsourced tools, it is easier to scale virtual sales capacity (versus field capacity) and easier yet to scale digital capacity. Technology trends once favored large organizations that could invest in IT infrastructure and support staff. Infrastructure, software, and platform as a service (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) have changed the game. Companies are ramping up digital marketing efforts, for example, using social media, email marketing platforms, and websites. Virtual communication tools such as Zoom and Loom (a fast-growing asynchronous video messaging service) have become ubiquitous for enabling interactions between customers and salespeople. And to tie it all together, cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) systems, such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, integrate classic CRM features (e.g., pipeline management, interaction tracking) with team collaboration tools (e.g., messaging and video calling), productivity features (e.g., email integration, expense management, quotes/proposals), analytics (sales reports, forecasting, AI), and more. And broader marketing automation solutions, such as Adobe, help to bring the marketing and sales teams together in streamlining the customer buying journey. The ability to use all these systems in a pay-as-you-go subscription model allows midsize sales organizations to more easily deploy and scale digital and virtual selling capabilities. While larger companies often use their resources to integrate multiple “best of breed” tools, midsize organizations will want to choose just a few solutions from the thousands available. A disciplined approach and guidance from an internal or external expert can help. In addition, with digital and virtual sales channels, geographic barriers are removed, opening new markets to smaller players. Challenge #2: Customizing and orchestrating the selling channels and steps As customer knowledge and self-sufficiency grow, buyers want sales content and channels to be customized to their evolving information needs. And, they expect interactions to be synchronized as they move between websites, call centers, field salespeople, and more. Larger companies with broad product lines and specialized sales and marketing teams struggle to provide the coordinated buying experience that customers demand and respond to. For example, a large pharmaceutical company had more than a dozen ways to share information with health care providers in just one therapeutic area. The company had field sales reps, inside sales reps, reimbursement specialists, medical science liaisons, patient support reps, and key account managers. In addition, there were several marketing roles that managed the content shared via these personal channels, along with roles for managing digital channel content (e.g., emails, websites, social media). To complicate matters further, the company’s support functions (e.g., technology, analytics, marketing operations, sales operations) operated as their own separate fiefdoms. Coordinating across all these separate teams and functions was a herculean task. Midsize organizations have an advantage. With flatter structures and fewer silos, it is much easier to get customers the information they need in a well-orchestrated way. And as growing midsize organizations create more specialized functions, having fewer existing silos to work across makes it easier to build a networked organizational structure that facilitates cooperation. Challenge #3: Adapting the sales organization almost continuously as markets evolve A new customer may value in-person sales meetings to work through product and pricing complexities. Later, that same customer may prefer using digital and virtual channels for repeat purchases. As technology, customer needs, and digital fluency evolve, sales organizations must rethink sales roles and channels. The line between inside and field sales is blurring, as field salespeople do more digital and virtual selling and inside salespeople handle more complex sales. New sales roles are emerging, for example, in high tech, where consumption-based offerings (e.g. cloud services) use customer success managers (CSMs) to help customers realize value. Sales channel strategies are also evolving. Some companies are reducing their reliance on channel partners while others are increasing the role of partners in meeting customer needs. Any sales force size and structure in place today will likely need to change in a year, if not sooner. The difficulties of restructuring sales and marketing teams and processes grow with organizational scale and complexity. Role changes, upsizing, downsizing, and customer relationship disruptions all play into the challenges. Not surprisingly, it can take large sales organizations two to four months to reconfigure legacy systems (e.g., sales reporting, incentive compensation). Midsize sales organizations must address these challenges too. But with fewer people and simpler reporting structures, they can adapt sales roles and channels in days (and sometimes in real time), not months. Challenge #4: Using data and tools to support broader sales decisions and processes Waves of digital innovation (e.g., the internet, mobility, big data, cloud computing, and now AI) continuously bring new opportunities beyond the reshaping of sales channels and structures (challenges #1-3). Sales organizations are using digital to improve talent management, and almost every decision and process that supports the sales organization. LinkedIn (for experienced hires) and Handshake (for college campus recruiting) have helped many midsize companies hire sales talent with the same ease as big companies. Companies of all sizes are deploying digital systems for tracking recruits, training, managing performance, coaching, providing feedback (e.g., dashboards and reporting), and administering incentive compensation. The key to success for midsize organizations is to have the discipline to choose a handful of high-impact solutions that work together. By combining agility with the added power of outsourced digital resources, midsize sales organization have a great opportunity to punch above their weight. Read more on Sales AZ Andris A.

Managing people Research: Dispersed Teams Succeed Fast, Fail Slow They’re more efficient — but not when it comes to killing a bad project. by Marie Louise Mors and David M. Waguespack by Marie Louise Mors and David M. Waguespack May 26, 2021 Yagi Studio/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. Research suggest that while dispersed teams, working remotely, are often more efficient than co-located teams at successfully completing projects, they also tend to persist with failing projects longer than than co-located teams. Going forward in a hybrid work environment, managers need to help dispersed teams get better at failing fast. This will involve better screening and planning of projects, more frequent synchronous working, and more managerial monitoring and intervention. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español Over the past year, we have all become used to working in dispersed teams. But now that it’s becoming possible to go back to the office and work side-by-side with colleagues, it’s natural to ask how much we actually will. The benefits of dispersed teamwork are well-documented. There’s plenty of research to show that bringing together teams across organizational or geographic boundaries allows companies to leverage diversity in people’s backgrounds, attitudes, and capabilities. This diversity promotes improvement, creativity, and innovation. Yet the same research has also recognized that communication problems, cultural misunderstandings or disagreements about when and where to meet may lead to coordination costs. In an effort to find out whether and under what circumstances the benefits would outweigh the costs, we examined 5,250 teams in an online community, many of which were dispersed across different organizations and geography. The members of this community work for a variety of organizations, including large organizations like Microsoft and Cisco, and the teams we studied voluntarily had come together to work on establishing standards for the internet. The results of our study were surprising: We found that dispersed teams were more efficient than non-dispersed teams, but only when the outcome of the project was successful. Conversely, co-located teams were quicker to abandon failing projects but were less efficient in working on projects that did succeed. Succeeding Faster In general, dispersed teams spent less time and went through fewer iterations before reaching success than the co-located teams. This suggests that team members are aware that it’s difficult to coordinate when they are located in different organizations or when they have to coordinate across geographic boundaries. So if the teams themselves choose when it’s worthwhile to work across boundaries, they are likely to do so only on projects that they believe will be successful, and they will work harder to achieve success. In contrast, co-located teams don’t need to make an extra coordination effort to complete their project. They have fewer incentives to work efficiently. They may also be more willing to take a risk in selecting a project, as they will perceive lower coordination costs going into it. Failing Slower On projects that failed in our sample, we found that co-located teams moved on to other projects more quickly than dispersed teams, which kept working on failed projects for more iterations before abandoning them. This might be because dispersed teams feel more committed to what they believe to be good ideas or think that their superior team will overcome any hurdles. We also observed that dispersed teams invested more effort in the projects early in the process than non-dispersed teams, which would make them prey to the sunk-cost fallacy and risk an escalation of commitment. Additionally, it may also be that it’s when failure occurs that the coordination costs kick in: Research also suggests that dispersed team members may find it more difficult to communicate around a failure or reach agreement on when it is time to abandon the project. In contrast, co-located teams may find it easier to meet up to discuss the progress of the project and agree when it is time to let it go. It may also be easier for non-dispersed teams to get started on new projects, so they may therefore be less reluctant to abandon failing projects. Research in entrepreneurship has shown the benefits of encouraging teams to take risk and embrace so-called “fast failures,” where teams fail often and quickly in order to learn. Our study suggests a qualifier to this recommendation: If teams are dispersed, they may not be very good at failing fast. And when dispersed teams hold on to failing projects, it is costly: The involved team members are unable to learn and move on quickly. In the meantime they consume resources that could have been freed up for investment in other projects. In other words, the real costs of dispersed teams lie with the failing projects that the teams are reluctant to abandon. So how can companies limit the costs of failure in dispersed teams? Increase the Efficiency of Failure Dispersed teams may need help identifying up front which projects are more likely to succeed or fail. Putting in place better coordination mechanisms may also help dispersed teams to reach agreement on when it is time to abandon a project. Failing this, management may have to step in. 1. Screening Dispersed teams may need support to ensure that they commit to projects that are really more likely to succeed. Actions to take could include scenario and risk planning, presenting ideas to colleagues or management before committing to projects, or putting in place situations that allow teams to seek critical input up front. Such conversations may also make team members more open to the fact that the project can fail and therefore leave them more ready to abandon failing projects. 2. Synchronous working When dispersed teams coordinate across time zones, they often structure tasks so that they work on the projects at different times. This makes it simple — and when things go well also efficient — to get the work done, but generates little opportunity for communication when work is actually done. This means that discussions of problems that indicate that the project is failing likely get delayed. Dispersed teams may therefore need to put in place mechanisms whereby work is done on the projects with some overlap in time to allow for synchronous conversations. 3. Management intervention Managers need to follow up more closely with dispersed teams than with co-located ones in order to ensure that progress is made and to look for indicators of when projects start to fail. Dispersed teams may also need more help in abandoning projects when they start to fail. With intervention at the right time, fast failures can also happen for dispersed teams so that resources are freed up quickly and can be redeployed on new projects. When it comes to co-located teams, management may need to pay attention to what projects are started, so as not to waste resources on projects with little potential, i.e., too many fast failures. As managers contemplate the lessons from the giant experiment in dispersed working that the pandemic imposed, they need to examine critically just what worked and what didn’t. They should also remember that co-location and dispersion need not be mutually exclusive. Parts of a project may require co-location, other components may not. Whatever the overall design, though, project managers need to ensure that the weaknesses of both working modes are properly addressed.

They’re up 150% in 2020 — and growing even faster in 2021. by Brenda R. Sharton by Brenda R. Sharton May 20, 2021 David Muir/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. These are unprecedented times in the world of cybersecurity, with ransomware attacks up 150% in 2020 and growing even faster in 2021. Most audit committees and senior management who have to make decisions around cyberattack say they never imagined they’d be in a discussion on whether and how much ransom to pay to hackers who are holding the company hostage. With good preparation and cybersecurity hygiene, and a plan in place, your company will reduce risk and be better prepared to deal with the unthinkable. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español With the migration to remote work over the last year, cyberattacks have increased exponentially. We saw more attacks of every kind, but the headline for 2020 was ransom attacks, which were up 150% over the previous year. The amount paid by victims of these attacks increased more than 300% in 2020. Already 2021 has seen a dramatic increase in this activity, with high-profile ransom attacks against critical infrastructure, private companies, and municipalities grabbing headlines on a daily basis. The amount of ransom demanded also has significantly increased this year, with some demands reaching tens of millions of dollars. And the attacks have become more sophisticated, with threat actors seizing sensitive company data and holding it hostage for payment. Who’s behind the recent surge in attacks? And how should companies respond to this increased threat? In this article, I’ll outline how ransomware attacks have evolved and what actions companies can take now to protect themselves. How Ransomware Attacks Have Changed A few years ago, the majority of ransom attacks involved only the deployment of ransomware. Hackers would gain access through a phishing email that would deploy malware when an unwitting employee clicked on a link. The malware would then encrypt company servers, and the extortionist would offer decryption keys in exchange for a ransom — typically in the five or sometimes six figures. Many times, the threat actors didn’t even gain access to company information — and sometimes they didn’t even know which company would be the ultimate target. They merely looked for systems to exploit and waited for the pay day. Once the ransom was paid — via Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency — the hackers would send decryption keys to gain access to their servers and even promise not to target the company again. The game has changed more recently — and has become a massive business for those who perpetrate these acts. According to Hiscox, Ltd., 43% of the more than 6,000 companies it surveyed had suffered a cyberattack in 2020 — up 38% in the 12 months before — and one in six of those attacks was a ransom attack. In 2020, the amount of ransom demanded grew to the mid to high seven-figure ranges, At the end of 2020 and into 2021, we have seen some ransom demands reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. In addition to the higher demands, the methodology has changed. Attacks are focused on exfiltrating company information — and the more sensitive, the better. These threat actors, who are often highly organized criminal organizations in eastern Europe and elsewhere, have done their research. They understand the company’s financial picture, the industry in which it operates, and how to exploit the company to maximum effect. In addition to deploying malware to encrypt company systems — targeting even the backup systems that are in place — the threat actors conduct reconnaissance of company files, ultimately exfiltrating large amounts of data, a terabyte in many instances. The threat actor then follows up with a “pay up or else” ultimatum, contacting the company with an extortion demand, to be paid in cryptocurrency, to obtain the decryption keys and to keep the company’s data private. The company is warned that should they choose not to pay, their sensitive information will be posted on the dark web on a “wall of shame” with others who were hacked and didn’t pay the ransom. Journalists who monitor the dark web can pick up this information and report more widely on the attack, sometimes causing damage to a company’s reputation or exposing valuable intellectual property or other confidential information, including customer and employee data. The company is left between a rock and a hard place — either pay millions of dollars in ransom to criminals or have sensitive and valuable confidential information publicly exposed. Notably, there does appear to be “honor among thieves” in the system. These extortionists depend upon companies believing that if they pay, all copies of the stolen files will be destroyed and/or the decryption keys provided. And the attackers do keep their word. In fact, some of these organizations are downright customer-service oriented, for example, accommodating the preferred cryptocurrency of the extortionee (with a small percentage upcharge to do so). We have even seen a threat actor “throw in” the decryption keys as a goodwill gesture, even though the company had already negotiated a lower ransom based upon the fact that it didn’t need the keys. What Should a Company Do If Attacked? In the event of a ransomware or other cyber extortion event, companies should follow their written incident response plan, in particular notifying senior management and the legal department. Looping in an attorney from the start will ensure that the investigation is protected by attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine, reducing the risk of exposure in any class-action lawsuits or other legal claims that may be brought in the wake of the data breach. The company’s insurance carrier also must be notified at the outset so that it can determine whether there is coverage under the applicable cyber insurance policy. The offer to pay ransom must be pre-approved by the insurance carrier prior to any communication to the threat actor. The decision whether to pay a ransom rests with senior management and often the board. Every ransomware or cyber extortion event must be assessed individually as to whether to pay or not. Keep an open mind: Often, companies lose precious time as decision makers unacquainted with ransom attacks vow on day one that the company will “never, ever” pay, then come around to the realities of the situation, the availability of insurance money, and the need to protect stakeholders before ultimately deciding to pay. In addition, keep calm and buy time. Threat actors try to create urgency and panic with their demands. Slowing things down is helpful in making the right decisions for your organization. Key questions to consider when deciding whether to pay ransom include: How sensitive is the information that has been accessed or exfiltrated? Does the company have back-ups of the information, or does it need the decryption keys? Do the costs of refusal, such as business disruption, the impact to systems or customers, negative publicity or reputational harm, exceed the ransom demand? Is the threat actor tied to a company that is on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned-entity list? (If so, it may be illegal under U.S. law to pay the ransom.) Depending on the severity of the incident and other factors, at the least most companies will file an online report with the FBI reporting the indicators of compromise (IOCs) involved in the attack to assist law enforcement in tracking these threat groups and hopefully someday bringing them to justice. So far, indictments in this area have been nearly non-existent and American companies have been left largely on their own to thwart these attacks, despite good intentions from law enforcement. How Can Companies Reduce the Risk? There are a number of steps that companies can take to reduce the risk of a ransom attack, as well as the risk of damage if an attack occurs. These include: Review your company’s incident response plan to be sure that in the event of an attack, it’s clear who is responsible for what actions. Review your company’s cyber insurance policy and be sure that ransom is covered and that the level of coverage reflects the current reality. Be sure multi-factor authentication is enabled on all company accounts, including service accounts and social media accounts, and that strong spam filters are in place. Establish a communication channel on a secure texting app so that senior management can communicate in the event of a cyberattack that takes down company email systems. Train your employees to identify phishing emails and educate them on the modus operandi of threat actors seeking to dupe them into clicking on links. Identify high-risk employees, such as those with administrative rights to systems, who might help perpetrate an insider attack. Assess the need for a prophylactic threat hunt by a reputable forensic firm engaged by counsel for privilege. For example, many companies treated the migration to a work from home environment as a “data security event” that would warrant a threat hunt of the system. Assess the cybersecurity programs and protocols for your key vendors — particularly any entity that handles sensitive or critical company data. Test back-up systems regularly and make sure they’re segregated from other company systems. These are unprecedented times in the world of cybersecurity. Most audit committees and senior management who have to make decisions around a ransom attack say they never imagined they would be in a discussion on whether and how much ransom to pay to hackers who are holding the company hostage. With good preparation and cybersecurity hygiene, and a plan in place, your company will reduce risk and be better prepared to deal with the unthinkable.

Cyberattacks have increased in both frequency and sophistication since the pandemic began as threat actors seek to take advantage of the unusual circumstances under which nearly all of us are working. Once a cyberattack occurs, companies largely are on their own to deal with the aftermath, so companies should take these seven steps to ensure they’re ready: 1) Review your incident response plan, 2) Stay up to date on current scams, 3) Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere, 4) Educate your employees, 5) Determine an alternative method for senior leadership to communicate, 6) Password protect your videoconferences, and 7) Check your cyber-insurance policy.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Prior to Covid-19, most companies perceived their worst-case cybersecurity scenario as a computer virus that would shut down company computer systems. In fact, just the opposite happened: a human virus has forced virtually entire workforces online, making companies more reliant than ever on their systems. The stakes of protecting those systems from a cyberattack could not be higher. In the words of the old American Express commercial: “What will you do? What will you do?” Over the past several weeks, we’ve observed that cyberattacks have increased at a rate of three to five times compared to pre-Covid. Phishing attempts have increased in both frequency and sophistication as threat actors seek to take advantage of the unusual circumstances under which nearly all of us are working. Scams focusing on treatments and cures for the novel coronavirus have been rampant — one recent operation by Interpol against fake Covid-19 “cure” sellers resulted in 121 arrests. Thousands of fraudulent coronavirus-themed websites are sprouting up per day. And Zoom, having skyrocketed in popularity, has experienced such a surge in videoconference hijacking that it has its own name, “Zoom-bombing.” Once a cyberattack occurs, companies largely are on their own. They have to scramble to counteract the attack and ensure that the threat actor is out of the system. They then may have to navigate industry regulators, while also trying to steer clear of the dreaded post-breach class action suit. What is a company to do? 1. Review your incident response plan. Every company should have an up-to-date, written plan in the event of an attack. It should be crystal clear as to who is to do what, who you will call for outside assistance, what the lines and protocols on communication will be within the company (such as board notification). This will protect the company from the confusion and early mistakes that often are made and that waste precious time in a crisis. In this environment, having a paper copy of the plan handy at home is also a good idea in the event of a systems breach. The chief privacy officer at one large financial institution recently told us that the last thing he did before he left the office for the quarantine was to grab a paper copy of the company’s incident response plan. 2. Stay up to date on current scams. Make sure all employees are aware of the most current scams and that your information security program has prepared a defense. Right now, the most ubiquitous is the “business email interruption” scam, where Office 365 or Gmail accounts are hacked via a phishing email. If an employee clicks on a bogus link, the cybercriminal has complete access to their inbox and can download malware onto their system. Sophisticated threat actors will most often target senior leadership or those with payment authority. By studying the contents of the particular inbox, the hacker is then able to gin up a very convincing fraudulent invoice purporting to be from a legitimate vendor, with changed wiring instructions so that the money is diverted to the hacker’s account and not to the legitimate recipient. While most of these attacks are “smash and grab” attempts to divert funds, in recent weeks, some criminals have focused instead on obtaining confidential company information — particularly with companies that may be working on breakthrough technology or cutting-edge health care products, sometimes for competitive purposes or sale on the dark web, among other things. With virtually all employees working remotely and the ordinary course of operations disrupted, this type of fraud is more likely to succeed, and the hackers know it. 3. Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere. Fortunately, there is a fairly effective tool to reduce the risk. Enabling MFA will stop all but the most sophisticated threat actors and it should be used on all accounts that are used by the company, not just administrative accounts. Remind employees to utilize MFA on their own devices as well. In one recent attack, a health care platform had MFA on its company systems but had failed to enable it on its Instagram account. The account was taken over by hackers for several hours while the criminals posted content and intercepted the direct messages of customers, among other things. 4. Educate your employees. Make sure your employees know that phishing attempts are on the rise and special care is needed as hackers try to take advantage of the crisis and a disrupted workplace. Cybercriminals will play to emotions. If it seems too good to be true, it is. If it is not a sender with whom they would normally interact, or a platform on which that person would communicate, they need to be on high alert. The CEO of the company is not likely to reach out to them and ask them to do something if he or she has never done so before, and especially not on a platform like LinkedIn or WhatsApp. Remind employees that if there is any question about the validity of an email, they should contact the sender via telephone — and make sure to use existing contact information, not the number on the email in question. Further Reading Coronavirus: Leadership and Recovery Leadership & Managing People Book 22.95 Add to Cart Save Share Be sure that anyone within the company in a position to send money out the door knows to be on high alert and not to wire any money or make any payment off of changed instructions without calling first. You can reduce the risk even further by wiring one dollar, and then calling your vendor to make sure it was received before sending the rest. Hackers have gotten so bold that in one recent fraud, they wrote in an email that they understood that they were asking for a large amount and so “Joe would call the company to confirm first.” The hacker himself called into the company to verify that the payment was “legitimate.” It wasn’t. 5. Determine an alternative method for senior leadership to communicate. If the unthinkable does happen and an attack brings down your company systems, how will senior leadership communicate among themselves and with employees? It is important to have an alternative means of communication ready to go so as not to lose precious time in a crisis. A regular text may be compromised — if a hacker has access to the company systems, it is easy for them to be able to set up a mechanism to intercept texts from the cell phones of senior managers. Consider setting up a secure texting app chain in advance so that a secure line of communication is ready, especially among those who will need to manage the breach if the normal email system is disrupted or compromised. 6. Password-protect your videoconferences. “Zoom-bombing” has become so rampant that the FBI has issued a warning. Recent cases involve unwanted guests shouting profanity and displaying other inappropriate content. To protect your videoconferences, do not post the link publicly. Make sure to require a meeting password, share the link and password only with authorized guests, and lock the meeting after it begins. Finally, if the content of your Zoom meeting is especially sensitive, consider doing an old-fashioned conference call instead. 7. Check your cyber-insurance policy. Do you have good cyber-insurance? These policies have become more comprehensive and cover more than they did a few years ago. Contact your broker now to determine what is “market” in your industry. You want to be negotiating that policy before you have an incident, not in the midst of one or just after. A good cyber policy will cover most costs associated with a data breach including counsel to guide you through the crisis, a forensic firm to come in (under the direction of counsel so as to be sure the work done is protected by attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrines) and, in many cases, even for ransom that the company pays to unencrypt its data. Given current conditions, the work from home paradigm is not likely to end anytime soon. Cybercriminals are notorious for their ability to adapt their malware and scams to meet companies’ defenses. It is an arms race to stay ahead of them. Staying up to date and keeping your workforce informed on the latest scams will help reduce the risk for your company.

More than 30% of sales activities can benefit from automation — if implemented effectively. by Doug J. Chung, Isabel Huber, Cuneyt Kayacan, Philipp Landauer, and Varun Sunku by Doug J. Chung, Isabel Huber, Cuneyt Kayacan, Philipp Landauer, and Varun Sunku June 02, 2021 HBR Staff Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. In this article, we examine sales automation’s benefits, how it can be applied to standard processes, and how to adopt new processes to improve your team’s ability to sell. We also detail five key principles for building and executing on your sales automation strategy. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Faced with profitability challenges, a global consumer electronics firm decided to restructure its business with a focus on optimizing costs, sales productivity, and customer satisfaction. To achieve these goals, the company automated customer and product master data, disputes and claims resolution, stock replenishment, and discount management. The firm also deployed automated web-crawler tools to improve competitive intelligence-gathering. With buy-in from leadership, the company was able to reduce the cost of select processes by 15% in only three years. The challenges faced by the consumer electronics firm are common among today’s sales organizations. A recent McKinsey study shows that more than 30% of sales activities can be automated to improve efficiency and effectiveness. However, lack of awareness of automation’s potential, inadequate tracking, return on investment (ROI) concerns, and delayed delivery challenges are hindrances to adoption. Many organizations that have overcome these challenges have still struggled to meet automation project targets, with only 50% reporting project success. At the other end of the spectrum, companies are pioneering sales automation with inspiring results. Using five prominent technologies — machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), natural language processing/generation (NLG), smart workflows, and cognitive agents — companies are reducing costs, improving customer service and scaling operations. In this article, we’ll examine sales automation’s overarching benefits, how it can be applied to standard sales processes, and how to successfully adopt new processes to improve your team’s ability to sell. We will also detail five key principles to consider while building and executing on your sales automation strategy. The Benefits of Sales Automation A European telecommunications firm turned to an IBM Watson-based chatbot to improve its customer service operation. The firm leveraged user-behavior analyses and usage-pattern predictions to improve processes based off data from customer interactions with the chatbot. The telco used its findings to improve its outreach and enhance its Customer Value Management (CVM) function. The program has contributed approximately 10% of total activations, with 6% margin improvement. Approximately 26% of calls are now fully managed by the chatbot with no human intervention. The initiative has reduced costs while improving efficiency and customer satisfaction. In addition to improved service, sales automation can improve accuracy and consistency by eliminating human errors and streamlining processes. It can boost scalability by allowing flexibility to grow key activities while sustaining execution quality. Customer coverage availability increases via the use of RPA and virtual agents and traceability expands, which improves audits and root-cause analyses. Here are a few examples of how automation functions within each stage of the sales process: Pre-Sales Improvements: Automated web crawlers collect market and competitor data to analyze and predict, for example, an industry’s total addressable market (TAM) and a customer’s present and future potential. AI allows organizations to better project market trends by region, which can be used to automatically update sales frontline quotas. Organizations can use advanced analytics to automate and systemize sales-call plans. RPA and ML tools can automatically detect bottlenecks and their root causes in the sales process and help sales-funnel management. ML tools can automatically generate call-lists and guide salespeople to call the right customers with the appropriate topic at the right time. Sales Improvements: NLP-based tools can decrease request-for-proposal (RFP) response time. RPA and ML tools automatically analyze and export pricing schemes. Automated workflows can optimally accelerate discount/rebate setting and management. ML tools can generate insights on actions and behavior associated with high closing rates. Billing workflows in turn are automated via RPA-based account receivables and payable management (e.g., invoice generation and processing). Post-Sales and Sales Operations Support: RPA- and NLP-based tools allow the automation of customer feedback and behavior analysis, enabling call centers to improve customer satisfaction and first-call resolution (FCR) while freeing up full-time equivalent (FTE) capacity. RPA and ML tools can identify customers with a high probability of churn and auto-generate promotional offers to retain them. Planning Your Sales Automation Strategy To successfully deploy enterprise sales automation, companies need to plan the process in advance. Depending on the organizational maturity level, process mapping, and IT landscape, as well as the company’s capabilities, we’ve mapped three routes that can yield an optimal result for each use case: Organizations can fix and automate processes by first lifting the procedure to best-in-class before starting to automate. They can automate first and fix later by finding quick solutions with existing capabilities to overcome key pain points followed by process optimization. Or they can fix and outsource, which involves improving the process and then shifting to external service providers. The consumer electronics firm and the telecommunications firm applied the fix and automate approach. It is comprised of the following three steps: Step 1: Redesign and simplify the customer journey. Eliminate unnecessary processes and outputs by removing unneeded approvals, data inputs, and reports. Then simplify forms and policies through the mapping of current and ideal-state processes and triage them based on complexity. Step 2: Standardize policies and processing logics for triaged processes. Organizations should capture existing best practices and ideal-state processes to codify in standard operating procedures. They should reduce the number of reports by consolidating customers’ requirements and standardizing the format. Step 3: Shift individual activities to customers or service providers. Organizations should transfer some activities to customers by providing self-service digital portals. They should also identify service providers who can take over simplified and standardized processes. Executing on Your Strategy As organizations pursue sales automation, most start the journey with a highly fragmented IT landscape characterized by complex legacy applications and high maintenance costs. Typical IT development/implementation thus involves a trade-off between fast-business impact and consistent architecture. There are three potential approaches: Start-up approach focuses on fast business impact and leads to excessive cost for maintenance; is typically not extendable. All-in-one approach targets overall integration and leads to excessive development cost. Stable island approach is a more recommended approach as well as a pragmatic midway, which balances impact and consistent architecture yielding viable end products. “Stable islands” is a stand-in term for viable end products. Successful automation leaders typically leverage a “stable island approach” enabled by process redesign, agile practices, capability building, value-capture plans, and responsive IT support. The importance of the process design cannot be overstated, as automation is most effective when combined with an agile process redesign. Most organizations skip this step and fail to realize the full benefit of sales automation. Five Principles for Sustained Sales Automation Success We have identified five principles for a successful sales automation journey by dissecting the journeys of organizations that have failed and succeeded at this process. 1. Thorough Process Re-Design. Carefully examine the sales process to insert value-adding activities and eliminate non-value-adding ones. Automating inefficient processes only transfers the inefficiency from humans to algorithms, often magnifying the inefficiency. The global consumer electronics firm invested up-front to understand the “as-is” sales process and worked with experts to create the “to-be” process. 2. Emphasis on Capabilities in Contrast to Deadlines. Sales automation can offer consistent productivity improvements, but also can become unsustainable if implementation outpaces capability. Invest in tailoring your automation’s capabilities, building to the needs of each key role. The global consumer electronics firm tracked skill development at a person-by-person level rather than being overly fixated on development timelines while building its automation center. 3. Clear Value-Capture Plans. Some organizations pursue “small value” quick wins and miss bigger automation opportunities, while others take a cost-myopic view and ignore value from improved quality, speed, and flexibility. It is critical to prioritize the right use-cases while using action plans with clear milestones and timelines to guide implementation. Both the European telecommunications player and the global consumer electronics firm ensured that their automation business cases were rooted in hard data and communicated guidelines around testing, acceptance, and release with specific action plans. 4. Responsive IT Support. IT plays a critical role in educating and training frontline workers, supporting automation planning, and ensuring security clearances. The global consumer electronics firm formed a development team within its sales function to create automation solutions fully in-house. The operations teams across Europe worked with the automation team to create success. This reduced external vendor involvement and enhanced custom solution flexibility. 5. Agile Practices. A dual operating model of agility combined with automation mitigates implementation challenges. Such an operating model could iteratively deliver end-products via multi-deployed teams with shared KPIs while embracing experimentation and development via coaching and feedback. Each sales automation journey requires its own unique planning and optimization. Use the techniques and principles we’ve provided as a guide to help explore your team’s journey, while making sure to carefully adapt and modify as needed. No matter how you choose to employ sales automation within your organization, it would benefit you to begin researching and planning today.

Don’t squander it. by Zhe Zhang and Vanessa M. Patrick by Zhe Zhang and Vanessa M. Patrick July 08, 2021 James W. Porter/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. Brand nicknames have been common for years, but it’s not always obvious how (if at all) brands should engage with them, especially online. In this piece, the authors discuss a recent study in which they found that social media posts that used nicknames had significantly higher like and share rates than those that used formal names, suggesting these unofficial names can have a major positive impact on engagement. However, in a series of follow-up studies, the authors found that who uses the nickname matters: When consumers used brand nicknames, it often made the information in their posts appear more credible and authentic to other consumers — but when a brand used its own nickname, it actually had the opposite effect. Based on these findings, the authors share six tactical strategies for how brands can overcome the potential pitfalls and leverage the benefits of a popular nickname. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español Ler em português Consumers having been driving Chevys, drinking Cokes, shopping at Tarjay, and eating at MickeyD’s for decades. But as more and more brand engagement moves online, how should marketers approach these brand nicknames in an increasingly digital landscape? In a recent study, we investigated how brand nicknames can influence both consumers’ engagement with brands and how credible they find a brand’s communications. In the first part of the study, we conducted an analysis of more than 10,000 consumer-written tweets that referenced three well-known brands, and compared share and like rates for posts that used formal name hashtags (e.g., #chevrolet, #buffalowildwings, and #newenglandpatriots) with posts that used nickname hashtags (e.g., #chevy, #bdubs, and #pats). We found that nicknames had a clear positive impact on engagement: On average, consumer tweets that used nickname hashtags were shared twice as much and liked three times as much as tweets that used the formal name hashtags. However, things get a little more complicated when you look at company-written posts. We conducted six follow-up studies with more than 1,500 U.S. consumers in which we compared how people reacted to brand nicknames in Instagram and Twitter posts coming from consumers and from official brand accounts. We found that who uses a brand nickname can make a big difference: When consumers used brand nicknames, it often made the information in their posts appear more credible and authentic to other consumers — but when a brand used its own nickname, it actually had the opposite effect. Why might that be? Our research suggests that when you see a fellow consumer use a nickname in an online review or social media post, it can send the message that the consumer has a genuine relationship with the brand, thus increasing your trust in whatever that consumer says about the brand. But when companies use nicknames in their own official communications, it can come across as promotional and manipulative, making their posts seem less credible. For example, in one study, we found that when consumers read an Instagram post in which Walmart used its nickname Wally World to promote a product, they were 9% less likely to agree that the post seemed sincere, and 10% less likely to buy the product, than those who read a post in which Walmart used its formal name. Of course, this doesn’t mean that brands shouldn’t engage at all with their nicknames — but it’s critical to engage in the right way. Based on our research, there are several key Dos and Don’ts that marketers should consider when it comes to managing brand nicknames in the digital world: What to Do: 1. Stay Abreast of Your Brand Nicknames The vast majority of consumers regularly encounter brand nicknames — in fact, only 3% of the consumers in our studies indicated that they had never seen a brand nickname online. It’s critical for marketers to be aware of how their customers are talking about them, and that includes keeping tabs on the evolving, informal language that consumers use. To do that, social media teams should make sure they’re monitoring not just their organization’s official name, but also any hashtags or account tags that use common nicknames for their brand. You may think of these unofficial names as secondary, but they can be a lot more widespread than you might realize. Take Chevrolet, for instance. Our analysis showed that 41% of Twitter posts that used a hashtag referencing the company used the nickname “Chevy” rather than the official name. The last thing a marketer would want would be to miss a customer complaint or opportunity for positive consumer engagement just because someone used @nickname instead of @officialname in their post. 2. Include Nicknames in Your SEO Strategy If you search for “Chevy” in Google, the first result that shows up is Chevrolet’s official website. But search for Mickey D’s or Tarjay, and you’ll see results from sites like Urban Dictionary and Wiktionary above these brand’s own websites. It’s critical to keep common brand nicknames in mind when designing your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy, to ensure that your consumers can find your brand easily no matter what name they use. Importantly, this isn’t just about Google hits. Has your brand partnered with a platform like Alexa to increase discoverability? If so, it’s worth ensuring that these third-party tools recognize your brand’s nicknames, since it’s very possible that those are the terms your customers will be using when searching for your company. And of course, marketers should be sure to take into account that a brand can have more than one nickname. For example, in our research we saw customers referring to their BMWs as beemers, beamers, and bimmers. Ensuring that all versions of your brand’s nickname are included in your SEO strategy can help to maximize your brand presence in a crowded digital landscape. 3. Protect Your Brand Nicknames Brand nicknames may be created and used by consumers, but it’s up to the company to make sure those nicknames are legally protected. This applies in a number of areas, from securing trademarks for common nicknames to purchasing URL domains. For instance, try going to www.beemer.com. Despite the fact that the term beemer has more than two million search results on Google, the URL isn’t owned by BMW. Proactively protecting your nicknames minimizes the risk of the name being hijacked by competitors or unrelated businesses. For example, many younger consumers refer to the retail giant Canadian Tire by the irreverent nickname “Crappy Tire,” but the company was taken by surprise when a consumer registered the website “crappytire.com” and used it to post negative complaints about the company. The company quickly filed a case with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), but they lost the legal battle. The WIPO found that the company had “failed to establish that the complainant (the company) has rights in the trademark or service mark,” and that therefore there was no legal recourse to reclaim the URL for their popular nickname. To make matters worse, Canadian Tire then offered to buy the domain, but the owner refused to sell. Similarly, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo ran into trouble when he tried to promote his line of underwear in the U.S. using his popular nickname CR7. It turned out that another business had already trademarked the name CR7 in America, sparking a complicated legal battle. While there’s no avoiding legal risk entirely, it’s a good idea for brands to ensure their nicknames are as protected as possible, before an issue arises. What Not to Do 1. Don’t Try to Stop Consumers from Using Nicknames In 1913, Coca-Cola launched a campaign called Coca-Cola: Ask for it by its full name. Yet after 30 years of persistent marketing, consumers continued to use the nickname “Coke.” More recently, Chevrolet experienced major backlash after news broke that the company had banned internal use of the name “Chevy” in an attempt to ensure brand consistency. Especially if a brand nickname has a negative connotation (such as “Whole Paycheck” for Whole Foods, or “Fix it again, Tony!” for Fiat), it can be tempting to try to limit its use. But while you might not like your brand’s nicknames, you can’t really stop your customers from using them — and you’re only likely to alienate them if you try. 2. Don’t Co-opt Nicknames The main reason that brand nicknames resonate with consumers is that they are created, used, and owned by consumers, meaning they are a genuine reflection of how consumers feel about a brand. Eighty-one percent of the consumers in our studies believed that brand nicknames originate from consumers, not companies, and 88% felt that nicknames should be used by individuals, not by companies. When a company blatantly tries to adopt its customers’ language for marketing purposes, it can come off as forced, transforming the nickname from a consumer-owned term of endearment into an official, company-owned name. This often eliminates the authenticity and genuineness that the name conveyed when used exclusively by consumers. Part of what makes this so challenging is that co-opting nicknames can seem beneficial to the brand in the short term, but in the long run, it can destroy the name’s status as a genuine nickname. This doesn’t mean that brands can never use nicknames — but it’s important to be strategic about how you use them. For example, fully rebranding with a consumer-generated nickname probably isn’t a good idea, but highlighting brand nicknames in referral programs, customer reviews, or other peer-to-peer interactions can help to make a brand’s marketing message seem authentic and genuine without threatening consumers’ ownership of the nickname. 3. Don’t Force a Nickname on Consumers For a nickname to stick, it has to come naturally. If your brand doesn’t have one yet, it can be tempting to come up with a nickname yourself and try to push it onto your customers — but our research suggests that is unlikely to work. Nicknames convey authenticity because they are organic, created and owned by consumers. That said, you don’t have to just sit around and wait, hoping that a good nickname will come to you. While you can’t force a nickname wholesale onto consumers, there are things you can do to nudge consumers to come up with a nickname. One approach is to encourage customers to choose a personal nickname for their product or account. For example, in our previous research, we noted how Chase bank offers customers the option to nickname their accounts, and how Nikon asks consumers to nickname their products during the online registration process. While these nicknames start out as private names used only by individual consumers, the catchy ones may go viral quickly if consumers choose to share them. Another approach is to explicitly crowdsource names from your customer base. This allows you to be proactive about your brand nickname strategy while still ensuring that those nicknames are genuinely created, shared, and owned by consumers. For example, the popular “Do us a flavor” campaign from Lay’s invited consumers to come up with their own names for new chip flavors, giving them ownership over the name without totally ceding control over the naming process. Of course, many of these consumer-generated nicknames will never gain traction. But encouraging consumers to come up with names for your products can plant the seeds of a successful nickname. Even if 99% of these names are only ever used by a handful of people, all you need is one to go viral for those seeds to grow into a genuine, widely-used nickname. *** Brand nicknames are only growing more popular among consumers in today’s digital landscape. When used in the right way, these nicknames can confer valuable “street cred” onto a brand, making its messages appear more authentic and credible to consumers. As such, marketers would be wise to keep tabs on these nicknames and ensure they are legally protected — but it is equally important for marketers to acknowledge that consumers are the true owners of these valuable brand assets, and not attempt to control or co-opt them. A well-known nickname is one of the greatest gifts that consumers can give to a brand they love. It’s up to marketers not to squander it.

Workspaces 4 Strategies for Building a Hybrid Workplace that Works Focus on equity, engagement, and ease. by Jim Keane and Todd Heiser by Jim Keane and Todd Heiser July 22, 2021 Illustration by Dominika Lipniewska Tweet Post Share Save Print Summary. More than 50% of companies plan to pilot new workspaces as their companies shift to a hybrid model. The authors, architects and office-furniture designers serving the world’s largest organizations, recommend leaders think through the following four design approaches as they consider their hybrid strategy. First, braid the physical and digital experiences to ensure equity, engagement, and ease. Second, flip open and enclosed spaces. Meetings will be more likely to happen in open spaces with moveable boundaries, while individual work will be in enclosed pods or enclaves. Third, shift from a fixed to fluid workspace. Perhaps your cafe can double as a hybrid meeting space. And lastly, remember that collaboration requires both individual work too. Employees should be able to easily move between “we” and “me” time without trekking across campus or getting hung up on complicated technology. Tweet Post Share Save Print Leer en español Ler em português The global pandemic has created new challenges and opportunities in almost every industry, and as the economy reopens competition will be intense. Winners will be those who most clearly understand their customer’s needs, collaborate to identify multiple solutions, prototype, iterate and bring new ideas to market. Those behaviors will only happen when people come together in the new, modern workplace. By all indications the future of work is hybrid: 52% of U.S. workers would prefer a mix of working from home and the office, saying it has a positive impact on their ability to be creative, solve problems and build relationships. Global research tells us 72% of corporate leaders plan to offer a hybrid model, and only 13% say they expect to decrease their real estate footprint in the next year, suggesting that organizations will continue to leverage their workplaces within a hybrid work future. But getting hybrid right will be hard. Deciding who works from the office and how often is a complex issue, and it will be different for every organization. If not done well it could threaten culture, collaboration, and innovation. Conversely, a well-executed hybrid workplace can be a magnet that brings people together and helps us work better than ever before. Organizations who will win know that workplaces designed for people and the resiliency of their organizations will help them move forward, learn, and remain competitive. To start, more than 50% of U.S. companies plan to pilot new spaces as part of their return to the office this year, for example, repurposing a café into a high-energy social and collaboration space that better supports new hybrid work patterns. As architects and office-furniture designers serving the world’s largest organizations, we recommend leaders think through four design approaches as you consider your hybrid strategy. Braid the Digital and Physical Experience As leaders of global teams, we know that bridging the gap between in-person and remote participants is hard, and hybrid work means there will inevitably be someone who is remote, regardless of well teams coordinate their in-office days. Remote colleagues can feel frustrated and unable to participate equally, becoming less engaged. This is especially true for creative and innovative work, such as brainstorming, which often use analog whiteboards or other physical products that are difficult for people on the other side of the camera to fully experience. The solution is to integrate physical spaces and technology with three key concepts in mind: equity, engagement, and ease. For example, currently, many conference rooms consist of a long table with a monitor at the end. In-person attendees sit around the table while remote participants are featured in a grid of tiny boxes, often on the same screen as any shared content. One way to create more equity is to give each participant their own screen, placing monitors on rolling carts that can easily be moved around. Teams can pull a remote colleague into a breakout session or up to the table. Many software systems now let you split people and content onto separate displays. To be fully engaged, people need clear sightlines to one another and to the content. Designing for employee engagement in digital-to-physical space means thinking like a movie director – lights, camera, audio, content. Some solutions we’re seeing are angled or mobile tables, additional lighting, extra speakers, in room microphones, and easy-to-move markerboards and displays. In addition, research tells us more people will connect to a meeting on their individual devices as well as the technology in the room. Ample power supplies, whiteboards, and a variety of software solutions will contribute to an easier, more seamless hybrid collaboration experience for people. Flip Enclosed and Open Spaces It is time to rethink the open plan. For decades, individual workstations have become more open with ever-increasing density, while meetings are held in enclosed conference rooms. As people return to the office, these spaces will begin to shift. Meetings will happen more often in open spaces with movable boundaries, and individual focus work will happen in enclosed spaces like pods or small enclaves. Open collaboration spaces are inherently more flexible because they don’t require fixed features in their design, so they can morph and change as new work patterns emerge. Innovation, problem-solving, and co-creation often use agile approaches — for example, quick stand-up meetings which require visible, persistent content which can be hosted in open spaces, defined by flexible furniture, easy-to-access tech, and other design elements. Meanwhile, individual spaces will need more enclosure to provide different levels of visual and acoustical privacy that people have come to expect while working at home. Video calls will happen everywhere, so enclosures — screens, panels, pods — will give people places to focus and mitigate disruptions. Shift from Fixed to Fluid Buildings are built for permanence, meanwhile the pace of business and change continues to accelerate. We can see the tensions between slow and fast emerge in the rise of pop-ups and coworking models with demand for shorter lease terms. Most companies who have real estate are asking, how much space do we need? The hybrid future solves for a more fluid workplace that can flex as needs change. Not only does this accelerate innovation and advance the culture of the organization, it can ensure real estate is always optimized. At Steelcase, we’ve optimized our own space by designing an open area that supports hybrid meetings in the morning, becomes the café at lunch, hosts a town hall in the afternoon, and can be rented for an evening event. Balance “We” and “Me” Work The pandemic has caused us to rethink the purpose and meaning of the office and many leaders have come to the conclusion that the office is a place for collaborative work. Gensler’s Research Institute, conducted amid the height of the pandemic, shows full-time work-from-home employees saw a drop of 37% in average collaboration time. As a result, leaders are rightfully focused on boosting collaboration, and Steelcase research shows that nearly two-thirds of leaders want to increase spaces for both in-person and hybrid forms of collaboration. But collaboration is not just about group work, it actually requires solitude too. Effective collaboration happens when there’s an ebb and flow of people coming together to work as a team and then moving apart to focus individually, process their ideas and follow up on assigned tasks. Too much together time, without enough individual focus time can result in groupthink, so it’s important that the pendulum not swing too far by designing offices that are all about the “we” and not balance the need for “me” spaces. The jury is still out on whether working from home is more productive or not, but in the past year, employees report higher levels of productivity when their home allows them to work without interruption. We must provide places with appropriate privacy at the office, too, and employees should be able to easily move from one type of work to another without trekking across campus or getting hung up with complicated technology. The office we return to must offer people a better experience than what they have at home and that means giving employees the right mix of spaces for the types of work that need to get done. Organizations that choose a “wait and see” approach risk frustrating their employees who find that the old office doesn’t support the new ways they — jeopardizing the competitive advantages of bringing people together. People whose organizations move forward and create workplaces that adapt, flex and thrive will attract and retain the best talent and benefit from innovation and growth. The future office will be a competitive advantage for organizations who take advantage of this moment in time. When we’re all back in the office, it won’t be the same, and that’s a good thing.

Workspaces 4 Strategies for Building a Hybrid Workplace that Works Focus on equity, engagement, and ease. by Jim Keane and Todd Heiser by Jim Keane and Todd Heiser July 22, 2021 Illustration by Dominika Lipniewska Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. More than 50% of companies plan to pilot new workspaces as their companies shift to a hybrid model. The authors, architects and office-furniture designers serving the world’s largest organizations, recommend leaders think through the following four design approaches as they consider their hybrid strategy. First, braid the physical and digital experiences to ensure equity, engagement, and ease. Second, flip open and enclosed spaces. Meetings will be more likely to happen in open spaces with moveable boundaries, while individual work will be in enclosed pods or enclaves. Third, shift from a fixed to fluid workspace. Perhaps your cafe can double as a hybrid meeting space. And lastly, remember that collaboration requires both individual work too. Employees should be able to easily move between “we” and “me” time without trekking across campus or getting hung up on complicated technology. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Ler em português The global pandemic has created new challenges and opportunities in almost every industry, and as the economy reopens competition will be intense. Winners will be those who most clearly understand their customer’s needs, collaborate to identify multiple solutions, prototype, iterate and bring new ideas to market. Those behaviors will only happen when people come together in the new, modern workplace. By all indications the future of work is hybrid: 52% of U.S. workers would prefer a mix of working from home and the office, saying it has a positive impact on their ability to be creative, solve problems and build relationships. Global research tells us 72% of corporate leaders plan to offer a hybrid model, and only 13% say they expect to decrease their real estate footprint in the next year, suggesting that organizations will continue to leverage their workplaces within a hybrid work future. But getting hybrid right will be hard. Deciding who works from the office and how often is a complex issue, and it will be different for every organization. If not done well it could threaten culture, collaboration, and innovation. Conversely, a well-executed hybrid workplace can be a magnet that brings people together and helps us work better than ever before. Organizations who will win know that workplaces designed for people and the resiliency of their organizations will help them move forward, learn, and remain competitive. To start, more than 50% of U.S. companies plan to pilot new spaces as part of their return to the office this year, for example, repurposing a café into a high-energy social and collaboration space that better supports new hybrid work patterns. As architects and office-furniture designers serving the world’s largest organizations, we recommend leaders think through four design approaches as you consider your hybrid strategy. Braid the Digital and Physical Experience As leaders of global teams, we know that bridging the gap between in-person and remote participants is hard, and hybrid work means there will inevitably be someone who is remote, regardless of well teams coordinate their in-office days. Remote colleagues can feel frustrated and unable to participate equally, becoming less engaged. This is especially true for creative and innovative work, such as brainstorming, which often use analog whiteboards or other physical products that are difficult for people on the other side of the camera to fully experience. The solution is to integrate physical spaces and technology with three key concepts in mind: equity, engagement, and ease. For example, currently, many conference rooms consist of a long table with a monitor at the end. In-person attendees sit around the table while remote participants are featured in a grid of tiny boxes, often on the same screen as any shared content. One way to create more equity is to give each participant their own screen, placing monitors on rolling carts that can easily be moved around. Teams can pull a remote colleague into a breakout session or up to the table. Many software systems now let you split people and content onto separate displays. To be fully engaged, people need clear sightlines to one another and to the content. Designing for employee engagement in digital-to-physical space means thinking like a movie director – lights, camera, audio, content. Some solutions we’re seeing are angled or mobile tables, additional lighting, extra speakers, in room microphones, and easy-to-move markerboards and displays. In addition, research tells us more people will connect to a meeting on their individual devices as well as the technology in the room. Ample power supplies, whiteboards, and a variety of software solutions will contribute to an easier, more seamless hybrid collaboration experience for people. Flip Enclosed and Open Spaces It is time to rethink the open plan. For decades, individual workstations have become more open with ever-increasing density, while meetings are held in enclosed conference rooms. As people return to the office, these spaces will begin to shift. Meetings will happen more often in open spaces with movable boundaries, and individual focus work will happen in enclosed spaces like pods or small enclaves. Open collaboration spaces are inherently more flexible because they don’t require fixed features in their design, so they can morph and change as new work patterns emerge. Innovation, problem-solving, and co-creation often use agile approaches — for example, quick stand-up meetings which require visible, persistent content which can be hosted in open spaces, defined by flexible furniture, easy-to-access tech, and other design elements. Meanwhile, individual spaces will need more enclosure to provide different levels of visual and acoustical privacy that people have come to expect while working at home. Video calls will happen everywhere, so enclosures — screens, panels, pods — will give people places to focus and mitigate disruptions. Shift from Fixed to Fluid Buildings are built for permanence, meanwhile the pace of business and change continues to accelerate. We can see the tensions between slow and fast emerge in the rise of pop-ups and coworking models with demand for shorter lease terms. Most companies who have real estate are asking, how much space do we need? The hybrid future solves for a more fluid workplace that can flex as needs change. Not only does this accelerate innovation and advance the culture of the organization, it can ensure real estate is always optimized. At Steelcase, we’ve optimized our own space by designing an open area that supports hybrid meetings in the morning, becomes the café at lunch, hosts a town hall in the afternoon, and can be rented for an evening event. Balance “We” and “Me” Work The pandemic has caused us to rethink the purpose and meaning of the office and many leaders have come to the conclusion that the office is a place for collaborative work. Gensler’s Research Institute, conducted amid the height of the pandemic, shows full-time work-from-home employees saw a drop of 37% in average collaboration time.

Peter Greenwood/Folio Art Managing people The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis Beyond Burned Out Chronic stress was rampant even before the pandemic. Leaders can’t ignore it any longer. by Jennifer Moss by Jennifer Moss February 10, 2021 · Long read The Big Idea Series / The Burnout Crisis 01 Beyond Burned Out 02 What Covid-19 Has Done to Our Well-Being, in 12 Charts 03 How the Pandemic Exacerbated Burnout 04 Six Lessons on Fighting Burnout from Boston’s Biggest Hospital 05 How to Beat Loneliness — and Make Friends — at Work 06 What I Learned When I Was Burned Out Summary. In our always-on world, burnout has long been a threat. But in 2020 burnout became rampant, seemingly overnight. Within weeks millions of people lost their jobs and faced financial and food insecurity. People working on the front lines worried for their physical safety, and those in health care put their lives at risk every day. A third of U.S. employees started “living at work” — with the kitchen table as their new pseudo-office. Over the year acute stress would become chronic stress. And it shows few signs of abating. Today’s level of burnout is the result of an existing problem made exponentially worse. Yet despite how massive the problem is, it’s never too late to fix it. Combating burnout may feel like an overwhelming and herculean task, especially after months of emotional fatigue, but if you’re armed with the right tools, it can be easier than you might think. And ready or not, we can’t ignore the urgency — we are in the midst of a burnout epidemic.

Leadership & Managing people It’s Time to Re-Onboard Everyone In the face of unprecedented turnover and uncertainty, even long-term employees may feel destabilized right now. by Liz Fosslien by Liz Fosslien August 16, 2021 Luis Alvarez/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. High turnover, the shift to hybrid work, and continued uncertainty about the future mean that your entire workforce may be feeling unmoored. These upheavals mean that even long-time employees — who have spent years building their reputations within an organization — may now feel they’re starting from scratch. That has enormous implications for performance, innovation, and well-being. By seizing this fall as a moment to re-onboard everyone, managers can boost team cohesion, performance, and well-being. The author presents five steps managers should take. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Ler em português “I’m the most tenured person on my team,” my friend Joyce, a senior marketing manager, told me. “But I feel like a new hire.” Despite having worked at her company for four years, a slew of recent changes had left Joyce feeling unmoored. After her manager quit in June, Joyce worked in a state of limbo for a month until she got a new boss. She started going back to the office two days a week, but soon stopped due to concerns about the Delta variant. Three of her teammates left and were replaced by four new hires. “I barely know anyone on my team,” Joyce continued. “I can dig up documents really easily, but other than that, I might as well have joined yesterday.” Joyce isn’t alone in feeling new to a company she’s worked at for years. As an expert on emotions at work and the head of content at Humu, a company focused on workplace behavioral change, I regularly help leaders, managers, and teams establish better ways of working. In the data and in conversations, I’ve seen two forces that are destabilizing employees: unprecedented turnover and uncertainty. The number of people switching jobs has skyrocketed to historical highs in what experts are calling “The Great Resignation.” At the same time, teams are starting to transition to hybrid work. These upheavals mean that even long-time employees — who have spent years building their reputations within an organization — may now feel they’re starting from scratch. That has enormous implications for performance, innovation, and well-being. When we start working in a new environment or with new colleagues, we tend to feel insecure because we haven’t had a chance to prove ourselves yet. Our self-doubt makes us less likely to suggest out-of-the-box ideas, ask questions, or take needed breaks. Great onboarding helps individuals regain their confidence and cuts down the time it takes for them to get up and running. But new hires aren’t the only people who could benefit from this type of structured support. Right now, everyone at your company needs some form of onboarding. If you’re a leader, you can’t sit back and hope your employees will successfully navigate so much turbulence. Hope is a terrible strategy. Instead, take advantage of the fact that August tends to be a slower month at work and prepare managers now for team-wide onboarding in the fall. Here are five steps you should encourage managers to take this fall. Kick off with connection. When I asked Joyce what her manager had done to bring her team together, she shook her head. “Not much.” It’s no wonder that Joyce felt disconnected at work. During periods of high turnover, you need to be especially intentional about creating opportunities for employees to get to know each other. To set your team up for success, invest in emotional connection as soon as possible and as often as possible. Schedule random, 30-minute 1:1s between members and kick meetings off with a lighthearted prompt. (A personal favorite: “What food is underrated?”) Rituals are also a great way to create space for people to open up. Try “High, Low, Ha,” where each person shares one highlight from their week, one low point, and one thing that made them laugh. Welcome unique contributions. One of the first messages your reports should hear is that they will be valued for everything that sets them apart. In an onboarding experiment, researchers randomly assigned new hires to one of three different welcome sessions. The first prompted people to reflect on how their unique perspectives could help them succeed in their new roles, another asked them to think about why they were proud to join the company, and the third focused on skills training. After six months, employees in the first group were less likely to have quit and delivered higher customer satisfaction scores. In 1:1s, ask each person to reflect on what they’re good at and how they can apply those skills to their current role. Based on these conversations, assign initial tasks that let individuals showcase their abilities. In team meetings, explicitly recognize novel suggestions. Try something like, “I hadn’t thought of it that way, thanks for pointing that out.” Help people learn who knows what. The most effective teams have a high level of “shared knowledge,” or a collective understanding of individual expertise, who’s responsible for what, and how everyone works together to get things done. To build shared knowledge, create early opportunities for team members to collaborate and discover each other’s unique talents. You can also start an email thread or channel where team members can post a problem for others who may have relevant experience to share their insights. One manager I spoke with ran a three-hour sprint in which she asked her newly formed team to redesign a sales pitch deck. Afterwards, she facilitated a debrief in which the group discussed each person’s unique contributions. The exercise energized the team — and helped them get a better sense of everyone’s unique talents. Rally everyone around a three-month mission. Quick wins boost motivation and confidence. To empower your team to accomplish shared victories early on, unite the group around an ambitious but achievable short-term goal. Alex, an engineering manager, set a three-month mission for his team to launch a new product feature customers had been asking about for years. Having a specific, impactful goal made it easier for the group to establish clear roles and processes. Alex’s team created 30-, 60-, and 90-day plans and, at the end of every week, met to celebrate their shared progress and shout out each other’s individual achievements. Set clear cultural expectations. When you’re new, seemingly small uncertainties (“Can I turn my video off during longer calls?”) can become a big source of stress. To combat these anxieties, schedule time for your team to agree on cultural and emotional norms. Science shows that setting clear expectations up front can have a powerful influence on employee performance. Here are a few prompts to get you started: How can we ensure teammates who aren’t in the office still have a voice? How will we track progress and update each other throughout the week? How do we each prefer to receive feedback? What guidelines should we set for meetings? What is it “okay” to do? (e.g., take breaks or ask questions) Make sure to write your answers down, and save them where they’re easily accessible to everyone. Reinforce healthy, productive norms with recognition. Showcasing stellar work or giving kudos for supportive behaviors is one of the fastest ways to boost motivation, create a clearer picture of what is valued within your team, and positively reinforce healthy norms. Consider celebrating the efforts of a small group of people, rather than just one person or everyone. In a field experiment, researchers split employees into groups of eight, then randomly sent either the top performer, the top three performers, or everyone in the group a thank-you card for their efforts. Recognizing the top three performers in a group led to the strongest overall performance increase. Finally, create opportunities for peers to recognize each other, too. Research shows that getting a compliment from a colleague can make new hires feel connected to the organization even faster than receiving praise from a manager. At Humu, we created a Slack channel called #cheersforpeers. Every month, anyone who has been mentioned in the channel or who recognized someone else is eligible for a raffle prize. High turnover, the shift to hybrid work, and continued uncertainty about the future mean that your entire workforce may be feeling unmoored. By seizing this fall as a moment to re-onboard everyone, managers can boost team cohesion, performance, and well-being.

Combating burnout may feel like an overwhelming and herculean task, especially after months of emotional fatigue, but if you’re armed with the right tools, it can be easier than you might think. And ready or not, we can’t ignore the urgency — we are in the midst of a burnout epidemic.

Leadership and managing people It’s Time to Re-Onboard Everyone In the face of unprecedented turnover and uncertainty, even long-term employees may feel destabilized right now. by Liz Fosslien by Liz Fosslien August 16, 2021 Luis Alvarez/Getty Images Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. High turnover, the shift to hybrid work, and continued uncertainty about the future mean that your entire workforce may be feeling unmoored. These upheavals mean that even long-time employees — who have spent years building their reputations within an organization — may now feel they’re starting from scratch. That has enormous implications for performance, innovation, and well-being. By seizing this fall as a moment to re-onboard everyone, managers can boost team cohesion, performance, and well-being. The author presents five steps managers should take. Tweet Post Share Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Leer en español Ler em português “I’m the most tenured person on my team,” my friend Joyce, a senior marketing manager, told me. “But I feel like a new hire.” Despite having worked at her company for four years, a slew of recent changes had left Joyce feeling unmoored. After her manager quit in June, Joyce worked in a state of limbo for a month until she got a new boss. She started going back to the office two days a week, but soon stopped due to concerns about the Delta variant. Three of her teammates left and were replaced by four new hires. “I barely know anyone on my team,” Joyce continued. “I can dig up documents really easily, but other than that, I might as well have joined yesterday.” Joyce isn’t alone in feeling new to a company she’s worked at for years. As an expert on emotions at work and the head of content at Humu, a company focused on workplace behavioral change, I regularly help leaders, managers, and teams establish better ways of working. In the data and in conversations, I’ve seen two forces that are destabilizing employees: unprecedented turnover and uncertainty. The number of people switching jobs has skyrocketed to historical highs in what experts are calling “The Great Resignation.” At the same time, teams are starting to transition to hybrid work. These upheavals mean that even long-time employees — who have spent years building their reputations within an organization — may now feel they’re starting from scratch. That has enormous implications for performance, innovation, and well-being. When we start working in a new environment or with new colleagues, we tend to feel insecure because we haven’t had a chance to prove ourselves yet. Our self-doubt makes us less likely to suggest out-of-the-box ideas, ask questions, or take needed breaks. Great onboarding helps individuals regain their confidence and cuts down the time it takes for them to get up and running. But new hires aren’t the only people who could benefit from this type of structured support. Right now, everyone at your company needs some form of onboarding. If you’re a leader, you can’t sit back and hope your employees will successfully navigate so much turbulence. Hope is a terrible strategy. Instead, take advantage of the fact that August tends to be a slower month at work and prepare managers now for team-wide onboarding in the fall. Here are five steps you should encourage managers to take this fall. Kick off with connection. When I asked Joyce what her manager had done to bring her team together, she shook her head. “Not much.” It’s no wonder that Joyce felt disconnected at work. During periods of high turnover, you need to be especially intentional about creating opportunities for employees to get to know each other. To set your team up for success, invest in emotional connection as soon as possible and as often as possible. Schedule random, 30-minute 1:1s between members and kick meetings off with a lighthearted prompt. (A personal favorite: “What food is underrated?”) Rituals are also a great way to create space for people to open up. Try “High, Low, Ha,” where each person shares one highlight from their week, one low point, and one thing that made them laugh. Welcome unique contributions. One of the first messages your reports should hear is that they will be valued for everything that sets them apart. In an onboarding experiment, researchers randomly assigned new hires to one of three different welcome sessions. The first prompted people to reflect on how their unique perspectives could help them succeed in their new roles, another asked them to think about why they were proud to join the company, and the third focused on skills training. After six months, employees in the first group were less likely to have quit and delivered higher customer satisfaction scores. In 1:1s, ask each person to reflect on what they’re good at and how they can apply those skills to their current role. Based on these conversations, assign initial tasks that let individuals showcase their abilities. In team meetings, explicitly recognize novel suggestions. Try something like, “I hadn’t thought of it that way, thanks for pointing that out.” Help people learn who knows what. The most effective teams have a high level of “shared knowledge,” or a collective understanding of individual expertise, who’s responsible for what, and how everyone works together to get things done. To build shared knowledge, create early opportunities for team members to collaborate and discover each other’s unique talents. You can also start an email thread or channel where team members can post a problem for others who may have relevant experience to share their insights. One manager I spoke with ran a three-hour sprint in which she asked her newly formed team to redesign a sales pitch deck. Afterwards, she facilitated a debrief in which the group discussed each person’s unique contributions. The exercise energized the team — and helped them get a better sense of everyone’s unique talents. Rally everyone around a three-month mission. Quick wins boost motivation and confidence. To empower your team to accomplish shared victories early on, unite the group around an ambitious but achievable short-term goal. Alex, an engineering manager, set a three-month mission for his team to launch a new product feature customers had been asking about for years. Having a specific, impactful goal made it easier for the group to establish clear roles and processes. Alex’s team created 30-, 60-, and 90-day plans and, at the end of every week, met to celebrate their shared progress and shout out each other’s individual achievements. Set clear cultural expectations. When you’re new, seemingly small uncertainties (“Can I turn my video off during longer calls?”) can become a big source of stress. To combat these anxieties, schedule time for your team to agree on cultural and emotional norms. Science shows that setting clear expectations up front can have a powerful influence on employee performance. Here are a few prompts to get you started: How can we ensure teammates who aren’t in the office still have a voice? How will we track progress and update each other throughout the week? How do we each prefer to receive feedback? What guidelines should we set for meetings? What is it “okay” to do? (e.g., take breaks or ask questions) Make sure to write your answers down, and save them where they’re easily accessible to everyone. Reinforce healthy, productive norms with recognition. Showcasing stellar work or giving kudos for supportive behaviors is one of the fastest ways to boost motivation, create a clearer picture of what is valued within your team, and positively reinforce healthy norms. Consider celebrating the efforts of a small group of people, rather than just one person or everyone. In a field experiment, researchers split employees into groups of eight, then randomly sent either the top performer, the top three performers, or everyone in the group a thank-you card for their efforts. Recognizing the top three performers in a group led to the strongest overall performance increase. Finally, create opportunities for peers to recognize each other, too. Research shows that getting a compliment from a colleague can make new hires feel connected to the organization even faster than receiving praise from a manager. At Humu, we created a Slack channel called #cheersforpeers. Every month, anyone who has been mentioned in the channel or who recognized someone else is eligible for a raffle prize. High turnover, the shift to hybrid work, and continued uncertainty about the future mean that your entire workforce may be feeling unmoored. By seizing this fall as a moment to re-onboard everyone, managers can boost team cohesion, performance, and well-being.
