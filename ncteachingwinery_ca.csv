Yet the palate delivers much more flavour impact on a dry, firm,balanced frame, with appealing tart red berry fruit and well-integrated toasty-biscuity character. Length and depth are very good. An accomplished wine all in all, drinking now but also cellarable another 2-4 years at least.Sharply priced, too. Well done students!” John Szabo (2020 Guide to Canada’s Best Wines from Wine Align) ""I drop in here once in a while to grab some interesting beers. My wife and I went on a brewery tour once and it was most fascinating. The students are quite passionate about their craft and the College is helping to grow the Craft Beer industry. Worth a stop!""

We learned so much about the Niagara escarpment and why it produces some of the best wines in the world.I joined the wine subscription service and got 2 bottles per month, 1 White and 1 Red.They were both superior wines and occasionally we ordered a case of the wine we liked.

Pure and very well made with excellent length.” Sarah D’Amato (2020 Guide to Canada’s Best Wines from Wine Align) Phenomenal ""initially took my husband on a lunch + tour of the college vinery, (pre-Covid) and it was phenomenal. We learned so much about the Niagara escarpment and why it produces some of the best wines in the world.I joined the wine subscription service and got 2 bottles per month, 1 White and 1 Red.They were both superior wines and occasionally we ordered a case of the wine we liked. I would highly recommend stopping by for lunch."" Vivian Teixeira (on Tripadvisor) 2018 Dean's List Pinot Noir 90 Points Tasted October 2020 “This is a nicely balanced, fairly smooth and lighter style Pinot with fairly generous aromas of cool clime sour red cherry/raspberry/cranberry fruit nicely framed by toasty oak spice and vanilla.

Yet the palate delivers much more flavour impact on a dry, firm,balanced frame, with appealing tart red berry fruit and well-integrated toasty-biscuity character. Length and depth are very good. An accomplished wine all in all, drinking now but also cellarable another 2-4 years at least.Sharply priced, too. Well done students!” John Szabo (2020 Guide to Canada’s Best Wines from Wine Align) ""I drop in here once in a while to grab some interesting beers. My wife and I went on a brewery tour once and it was most fascinating. The students are quite passionate about their craft and the College is helping to grow the Craft Beer industry. Worth a stop!""
