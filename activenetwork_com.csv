Further, you acknowledge that you have read and understood Active’s Privacy Policy located at: https://www.activenetwork.com/information/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which you understand will apply to the processing of your personal information in relation to the Site and the Services. Active may revise and update these Terms of Use at any time; please periodically review them, because your continued usage of the Site indicates your agreement with any such changes. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon notice, which we may provide by any means including, without limitation, posting a revised version of these Terms of Use on the Site. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will endeavor to notify you in advance of such change, by highlighting the change on the Sites or by sending an email to you at the email address that you have registered with us. You can determine when these Terms of Use were last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms of Use. You should return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under these Terms of Use, including any indemnification obligations, warranties, and limitations of liability. ‍By using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that (i) you are a resident of the United States and are at least 16 years of age or, if under the age of 16, your parent has consented to your use of the Site via our consent mechanism as provided to your parent, or (ii) you are not a resident of the United States and are at least 18 years of age or, if under the age of 18, you have the consent of your parent or guardian (over the age of 18) to use the Site.

Active's use of your registration data, together with other personal information, is addressed in the Privacy Policy. ‍To the extent permissible by law, we are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password due to your failure to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of your registration, your disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password. If you have reason to believe that your registration is no longer secure, you must promptly change your password to the Site and immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@active.com.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, we grant you a limited license to use the Site and Materials for your personal use only; provided that you may not use, reproduce, modify, display, publicly perform, distribute, create derivative works of or circumvent any technological measure that effectively controls access to the Site and/or Materials in any way including, without limitation, by manual or automatic device or process, for any purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights not specifically granted in the license set forth above shall be reserved and remain always with Active. Use of the Site and Materials for any purpose other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use is a violation of our copyrights and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. The Site, including all Site software, databases, proprietary information, documentation, software, contents, computer codes, ideas, know-how and Materials (and all modifications and derivative works thereof and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto or contained therein) including, without limitation, the selection, compilations, sequence and “look and feel” and arrangement of items, is owned and operated by Active and will remain the exclusive property of Active. You acknowledge that the Site is protected by copyright, trademark and other laws. You further acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Materials. You shall not challenge, contest or otherwise impair Active’s ownership of the Site and the content therein.The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Site (collectively the “Trademarks”) are the registered and unregistered trademarks of Active and Active’s advertisers, licensors, suppliers and others. The Trademarks owned by Active, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not offered by Active, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any manner that disparages Active. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of Active, Active’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Misuse of any Trademarks is prohibited, and Active will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings. You may make comparative or other nominative fair use of Trademarks owned by Active in advertising and promotional materials, and in referring to Active’s products and services (for example, in a magazine article) without Active’s permission, provided you follow standard trademark usage practices and provide proper attribution to Active. Other uses that are not “fair use” require written permission from Active, and absent such express permission, you agree not to use or display the Trademarks owned by Active in any manner. Please make such requests by email to support@active.com; we will evaluate your request as soon as possible. Trademarks owned by Active include, without limitation, those published and searchable on the United States Patent and Trademark Office located at http://www.uspto.gov at “Trademarks Search” and the Canadian Trademark Office at: http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/cipo/welcome/welcom-e.html at “Trade-marks Database” indicating Active Network, LLC as the identified owner for conducting such search. 4. Making Purchases. ‍If you wish to purchase products or services or register for an Event described on the Site (each, a “Transaction”), you will be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that any such information will be treated by Active in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your Transactions. In addition to these Terms of Use, your Transaction shall be subject to any Additional Terms applicable to such services, features or purchases. Registration for Events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations. You acknowledge that complying with any such laws is your responsibility, and YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD US LIABLE FOR YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY LAW OR OUR FAILURE TO NOTIFY YOU OF, OR PROPERLY APPLY, ANY LAW.

You further agree that you will not attempt to conceal your identity or location by using virtual private networks (""VPNs"") multiple Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses or email addresses. You grant Active the right to provide any information you submit to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction. Descriptions or images of, or references to, third party products, services, or Events on the Site do not imply Active’s endorsement of such products or services.

Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to Active’s acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your event registration may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future purchases made on such credit card accounts and/or on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the Site. Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5. Information Provided by Active. ‍Although Active strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, the nature of the data and other information contained on the Site are subject to frequent change. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Active endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. In addition, portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various artists, sports teams and other persons. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement thereof, and Active expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing. 6. Forums and User Content. ‍Active and its designees may host message boards, blog feeds and other forums found on the Site (collectively, the “Forums”), and you may have the ability to provide or upload to the Site creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, content, audio recordings, videos, photographs, graphics, artwork or other copyrighted works and materials (collectively, “User Content”). By sending or transmitting User Content to Active, or by posting such User Content to any area of the Site, YOU GRANT US AND OUR DESIGNEES A PERPETUAL, WORLDWIDE, NON-EXCLUSIVE, UNLIMITED, TRANSFERABLE, FULLY SUBLICENSEABLE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), ASSIGNABLE, ROYALTY-FREE, FULLY PAID UP, IRREVOCABLE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO USE, REPRODUCE, DISTRIBUTE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), MODIFY, ADAPT, COMBINE WITH OTHER WORKS, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, PUBLICLY PERFORM, DISPLAY, STORE, DIGITALLY PERFORM, PUBLISH (ON THE SITE, ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE(S), IN PRINT, RADIO, TELEVISION OR ELSEWHERE), MAKE, HAVE MADE, SELL, OFFER FOR SALE, IMPORT AND COMMERCIALIZE USER CONTENT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, IN ANY MANNER AND CONTEXT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USAGE IN COMMERCIAL, ADVERTISING OR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS), NOW KNOWN OR IN THE FUTURE DISCOVERED, IN ACTIVE’S SOLE DISCRETION, IN ANY WAY, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA NOW KNOWN OR HEREINAFTER DISCOVERED, WITHOUT LIMITATION AND WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY. To the extent permitted by law, you specifically waive any “moral rights” in and to the User Content. The foregoing grant includes without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property in and to your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, none of the User Content will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any User Content. If you have any User Content that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it to the Site. ACTIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER’S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY USER CONTENT YOU POST TO THE SITE. If Active does decide, in its sole discretion, to attribute User Content to you, you hereby grant Active the right to use your member name with respect to such attribution, and hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive any claims (including, without limitation, any privacy or publicity rights claims) with respect to such use of your member name. For clarity, the foregoing license grant to Active does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to the material in your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You further acknowledge that Active (a) is under no obligation to post, display or otherwise use any User Content, and (b) has no obligation whatsoever to pay you any royalty or other amounts on any revenues or other consideration that Active receives directly or indirectly from the use or display of your User Content or otherwise from the exercise of Active’s rights granted under these Terms of Use. You hereby agree not to instigate, support, maintain, or authorize any action, claim, or lawsuit against Active or its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, or any other person, on the grounds that any use of User Content, or any derivative works thereof, infringe any of your rights as creator of the User Content, including, without limitation, trademark rights, copyrights, publicity rights, privacy rights and moral rights. Information on our Forums may be provided by our staff and other contributors, some of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with Active. You acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in our Forums and that people participating in such Forums occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, obscene, threatening, harassing or encourages any such conduct, or that otherwise violate any of the Codes of Conduct, and you hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Active with respect thereto. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the Site or Forums by third parties, whether such third parties are visitors to the Site, members of the Active community or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Active. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates, suppliers or agents be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information obtained through the Site. If notified by a user of User Content that allegedly does not conform to these Terms of Use, Active may in its sole discretion investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove the User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent and/or warrant that: (i) you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to the User Content and to grant the rights and licenses to Active under all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary or intellectual property rights in and to any and all User Content in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of such person in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use or, if such persons are minors, the written consent, release, and/or permission of such minor’s parent or legal guardian.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

You understand that any such information will be treated by Active in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred.

In addition to these Terms of Use, your Transaction shall be subject to any Additional Terms applicable to such services, features or purchases. Registration for Events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations.

WE WILL COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAY PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US TO ASSIST IN ANY INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION THEY MAY CONDUCT.

Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

You understand and agree that in Active’s sole discretion, and without prior notice, Active may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Active’s other services, cancel your event registration, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Active believes may be associated with you, cancel an event registration associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized User Content or exercise any other remedy available, if Active believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Active believes you act in concert, or the User Content you provide, or any resale of such event registrations purchased through Active, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms of Use or the law, or violates the rights of Active, a customer of Active or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Active for violations of these Terms of Use and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Active uses these categories of personal information differently because while we have a direct relationship with our Customers and therefore may determine why and how to handle Customer Information, our relationship with End Users is indirect and based on our relationship with our Customer. We only handle End User Information in accordance with our Customer’s instructions. If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly.

Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍We share your personal information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an ActiveService provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. With advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes only related to our Customers (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, notices, and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍EU transfer mechanism. Active participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. PrivacyShield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the PrivacyShield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may been titled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our notices, policies, or procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity. Suspected computer mischief may be reported to the appropriate authorities. Please remember that communications over the internet such as emails are not secure. We seek to keep secure all confidential information and personal information submitted to us in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations. However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website. Unique device identifiers like IP address or UDID recognize a visitor’s computer or other device used to access the internet. Unique device identifiers are used alone and in conjunction with cookies and other tracking technologies for the purpose of “remembering” computers or other devices used to access the Sites and Apps.

If you do not allow these cookies then some of these services may not function properly. Targeting Cookies. Active does not set targeting cookies on EndUser facing Sites where this Notice is posted. However, our Customers may set these cookies on End User facing Sites for their own purposes and subject to their own privacy notice. Active may alone or through an advertising partner set cookies on Customer facing Sites. These cookies may be used by those partners to build a profile of Customer interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites, including social media platforms. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of the irrespective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta,Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services;(5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Use of the Site and Materials for any purpose other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use is a violation of our copyrights and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. The Site, including all Site software, databases, proprietary information, documentation, software, contents, computer codes, ideas, know-how and Materials (and all modifications and derivative works thereof and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto or contained therein) including, without limitation, the selection, compilations, sequence and “look and feel” and arrangement of items, is owned and operated by Active and will remain the exclusive property of Active.

The Trademarks owned by Active, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not offered by Active, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any manner that disparages Active. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of Active, Active’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Misuse of any Trademarks is prohibited, and Active will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings. You may make comparative or other nominative fair use of Trademarks owned by Active in advertising and promotional materials, and in referring to Active’s products and services (for example, in a magazine article) without Active’s permission, provided you follow standard trademark usage practices and provide proper attribution to Active. Other uses that are not “fair use” require written permission from Active, and absent such express permission, you agree not to use or display the Trademarks owned by Active in any manner. Please make such requests by email to support@active.com; we will evaluate your request as soon as possible. Trademarks owned by Active include, without limitation, those published and searchable on the United States Patent and Trademark Office located at http://www.uspto.gov at “Trademarks Search” and the Canadian Trademark Office at: http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/cipo/welcome/welcom-e.html at “Trade-marks Database” indicating Active Network, LLC as the identified owner for conducting such search. 4.

You understand that any such information will be treated by Active in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred.

Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

Suspected Violation of these Terms or Law; Injunctive, Equitable Relief, and Liquidated Damages. ‍Violations of these Terms of Use, including unauthorized use of the Site, may be investigated and appropriate legal action may be taken, including without limitation civil, criminal and injunctive redress. You understand and agree that in Active’s sole discretion, and without prior notice, Active may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Active’s other services, cancel your event registration, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Active believes may be associated with you, cancel an event registration associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized User Content or exercise any other remedy available, if Active believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Active believes you act in concert, or the User Content you provide, or any resale of such event registrations purchased through Active, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms of Use or the law, or violates the rights of Active, a customer of Active or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Active for violations of these Terms of Use and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations. You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site. You further agree that monetary damages for abusive use of the Site are difficult to ascertain and that proof of monetary damages for abusive use would be costly and difficult to calculate. Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you. Active also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to impose limits on certain features and services and to restrict access to the Site without notice to you. Active shall not be liable to you or any third party for any claim or cause of action arising out of its exercise of the foregoing rights. 12. Disclaimers.

Indemnification. ‍You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Active and its affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers and sponsors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach of these Terms of Use, including any violation of the Code of Conduct, above; (b) any allegation that any User Content or other materials you submit to us or transmit to the Site infringe or otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; (c) your activities in connection with the Site; and/or (d) termination of your access to the Site. 15. Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features.

Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis.

In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍EU transfer mechanism.

Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the PrivacyShield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site.

You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction.

Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use.

You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you.

Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side.

Active provides activity and participant management solutions (our “Services”) that enable nonprofits, universities, state and local agencies, and other organizations (our “Customers”) to manage the events, camps, and classes, or other programs they offer to individuals (“End Users”). In this Privacy Notice (“Notice”), we describe how we collect, use, and share personal information about our Customers and End Users through the Services, websites (“Sites”), and mobile applications (“Apps”) where this Notice is posted. We may provide additional privacy policies as necessary that apply to your use of certain products. This Notice applies to the Services as provided by Active on its own behalf or in combination with one of its parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries.

Active uses these categories of personal information differently because while we have a direct relationship with our Customers and therefore may determine why and how to handle Customer Information, our relationship with End Users is indirect and based on our relationship with our Customer. We only handle End User Information in accordance with our Customer’s instructions. If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly.

Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our policies and procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity. Suspected computer mischief may be reported to the appropriate authorities. Please remember that communications over the internet such as emails are not secure. We seek to keep secure all confidential information and personal information submitted to us in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations. However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website. Unique device identifiers like IP address or UDID recognize a visitor’s computer or other device used to access the internet.

Active uses these categories of personal information differently because while we have a direct relationship with our Customers and therefore may determine why and how to handle Customer Information, our relationship with End Users is indirect and based on our relationship with our Customer. We only handle End User Information in accordance with our Customer’s instructions. If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly.

Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our policies and procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity. Suspected computer mischief may be reported to the appropriate authorities. Please remember that communications over the internet such as emails are not secure. We seek to keep secure all confidential information and personal information submitted to us in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations. However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website.

Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our policies and procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity. Suspected computer mischief may be reported to the appropriate authorities. Please remember that communications over the internet such as emails are not secure. We seek to keep secure all confidential information and personal information submitted to us in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations. However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website. Unique device identifiers like IP address or UDID recognize a visitor’s computer or other device used to access the internet.

This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals.

You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

Indemnification. ‍You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Active and its affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers and sponsors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach of these Terms of Use, including any violation of the Code of Conduct, above; (b) any allegation that any User Content or other materials you submit to us or transmit to the Site infringe or otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; (c) your activities in connection with the Site; and/or (d) termination of your access to the Site. 15. Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees.

You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site.

You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise.

In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action.

Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

You understand and agree that in Active’s sole discretion, and without prior notice, Active may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Active’s other services, cancel your event registration, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Active believes may be associated with you, cancel an event registration associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized User Content or exercise any other remedy available, if Active believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Active believes you act in concert, or the User Content you provide, or any resale of such event registrations purchased through Active, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms of Use or the law, or violates the rights of Active, a customer of Active or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Active for violations of these Terms of Use and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations. You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to Active’s acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your event registration may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future purchases made on such credit card accounts and/or on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the Site. Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5. Information Provided by Active. ‍Although Active strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, the nature of the data and other information contained on the Site are subject to frequent change. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Active endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. In addition, portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various artists, sports teams and other persons. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement thereof, and Active expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing. 6. Forums and User Content. ‍Active and its designees may host message boards, blog feeds and other forums found on the Site (collectively, the “Forums”), and you may have the ability to provide or upload to the Site creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, content, audio recordings, videos, photographs, graphics, artwork or other copyrighted works and materials (collectively, “User Content”). By sending or transmitting User Content to Active, or by posting such User Content to any area of the Site, YOU GRANT US AND OUR DESIGNEES A PERPETUAL, WORLDWIDE, NON-EXCLUSIVE, UNLIMITED, TRANSFERABLE, FULLY SUBLICENSEABLE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), ASSIGNABLE, ROYALTY-FREE, FULLY PAID UP, IRREVOCABLE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO USE, REPRODUCE, DISTRIBUTE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), MODIFY, ADAPT, COMBINE WITH OTHER WORKS, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, PUBLICLY PERFORM, DISPLAY, STORE, DIGITALLY PERFORM, PUBLISH (ON THE SITE, ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE(S), IN PRINT, RADIO, TELEVISION OR ELSEWHERE), MAKE, HAVE MADE, SELL, OFFER FOR SALE, IMPORT AND COMMERCIALIZE USER CONTENT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, IN ANY MANNER AND CONTEXT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USAGE IN COMMERCIAL, ADVERTISING OR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS), NOW KNOWN OR IN THE FUTURE DISCOVERED, IN ACTIVE’S SOLE DISCRETION, IN ANY WAY, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA NOW KNOWN OR HEREINAFTER DISCOVERED, WITHOUT LIMITATION AND WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY. To the extent permitted by law, you specifically waive any “moral rights” in and to the User Content. The foregoing grant includes without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property in and to your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, none of the User Content will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any User Content. If you have any User Content that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it to the Site. ACTIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER’S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY USER CONTENT YOU POST TO THE SITE. If Active does decide, in its sole discretion, to attribute User Content to you, you hereby grant Active the right to use your member name with respect to such attribution, and hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive any claims (including, without limitation, any privacy or publicity rights claims) with respect to such use of your member name.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website. Unique device identifiers like IP address or UDID recognize a visitor’s computer or other device used to access the internet. Unique device identifiers are used alone and in conjunction with cookies and other tracking technologies for the purpose of “remembering” computers or other devices used to access the Sites and Apps. Cookies can be classified by duration and by source: Duration. The Sites use both “session” and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary - they terminate when you close your browser or otherwise end your “active” browsing session. Persistent cookies remember you on subsequent visits. Persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, and they will remain on your computer or other device unless you choose to delete them (see below for “How to Delete or Block Cookies”). Source. Cookies can be “first-party” or “third-party” cookies, which means that they are either issued by or on behalf of Active or by a third-party operator of another website. For an example of a third-party cookie, our Sites may contain a Facebook “like” button, which would set a cookie that can be read by Facebook. Our Sites may use both first-party and third-party cookies. The cookies that we may use on the Sites fall into the following categories: Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions taken by you such as logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but blocking them may impede the functionality of the Sites. Performance Cookies. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance. Functionality Cookies. These cookies enable the Sites to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some of these services may not function properly. Targeting Cookies. Active does not set targeting cookies on our End User facing Sites where this Notice is posted. However, our Customers may set these cookies on End User facing Sites for their own purposes and subject to their own privacy policy. On our Customer facing Sites only, we may set targeting cookies. These cookies may be set through our Sites by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites, including social media platforms. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. How to Delete or Block Cookies ‍On some Sites, when technically feasible, we will enable tools to help you make choices about cookies. You may also delete or block cookies at any time by changing your browser settings. You can click “Help” in the toolbar of your browser for instruction or review the cookie management guide produced by the Interactive Advertising Bureau available at www.allaboutcookies.org. If you delete or block cookies, some features of the Sites may not function properly. ‍External Links ‍ ‍Active may include links to other websites that are not under Active’s control.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change any portion of this Notice, in whole or in part, at any time. When we amend this Notice, we will revise the “last updated” date located at the top of the document. We will also take reasonable steps to ensure you are made aware of any material updates including providing you direct communication about such changes or providing a notification through the Services, as appropriate. If you provide personal information to us or access or use the Services after this Notice has been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally consented and agreed to such changes. The most current version of this Notice will be available on the Sites and Apps and will supersede all previous versions of this Notice. ‍Choice of Law. This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action.

Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use.

You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Active provides activity and participant management solutions (our “Services”) that enable nonprofits, universities, state and local agencies, and other organizations (our “Customers”) to manage the events, camps, and classes, or other programs they offer to individuals (“End Users”). In this Privacy Notice (“Notice”), we describe how we collect, use, and share personal information about our Customers and End Users through the Services, websites (“Sites”), and mobile applications (“Apps”) where this Notice is posted. We may provide additional privacy policies as necessary that apply to your use of certain products. This Notice applies to the Services as provided by Active on its own behalf or in combination with one of its parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries. In this Notice, we provide information about: PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES CHILDREN UNDER 18 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS OTHER INFORMATION HOW TO CONTACT US Please be aware that not all of the information in this Notice will be directly applicable to our handling of your personal information.

If you have any questions about our processing of your personal information, please contact us at privacy@activenetwork.com. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT Active collects two different categories of personal information when Customers and End Users interact with Active: The personal information of our Customers or potential customers of Active (“Customer Information”), and The personal information of End Users who use Active to register with our Customers (“End User Information”). Active uses these categories of personal information differently because while we have a direct relationship with our Customers and therefore may determine why and how to handle Customer Information, our relationship with End Users is indirect and based on our relationship with our Customer. We only handle End User Information in accordance with our Customer’s instructions. If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly. We will only collect, use, and share personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do so. Subject to consent if required by law, we may collect the following categories and types of Customer Information as relevant to the Services with which you, a Customer, engaging: Identifiers (including name and contact information including telephone number, email address, or postal address, or other specific identifiers related to your use of the Service) Information protected against security breaches (such as financial account information and username and password) Commercial information (such as your access and purchase history, the products and services we provide to you, your marketing preferences, or information you provide in any communication with us or when you participate in any blog, community or forum on our Sites) Internet/electronic activity (see “Cookies” for additional information) Professional or employment related information (such as your status with the organization with which you are affiliated) Inferences from the foregoing such as your preferences, characteristics or predispositions Active may also collect the following categories of End User Information on behalf of and as directed by our Customers: Identifiers (such as name, contact information including telephone number, email address, or postal address), Information protected against security breaches (such as your name and financial account, username and password), Protected characteristics (like race, gender, ethnicity, etc.) Commercial information (including records of registration activity, products or services purchased, marketing preferences, information provided in any communication with us, including customer service requests, email messages, and call recordings, or information an provided through participation in any blog, community or forum on Active) Internet/electronic activity (see “Cookies” for additional information) Geolocation Education information How we use your personal information.

Maintain data security including detecting and responding to security incidents and protecting you, and us, from fraud Monitor our Sites including gathering usage data and other analytic information that enables us to maintain and improve the Services Other uses that are required for us to meet our legal, contractual or regulatory requirements Other uses as directed by Customers and subject to their privacy policy. Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our policies and procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity. Suspected computer mischief may be reported to the appropriate authorities. Please remember that communications over the internet such as emails are not secure. We seek to keep secure all confidential information and personal information submitted to us in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations. However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website.

This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

These Terms of Use shall apply to (a) all websites owned and/or operated by Active including without limitation the website on which these Terms of Use are posted and Active’s subsidiary and/or affiliate entities, including but not limited to Maximum Solutions, LLC, JumpForward LLC, and Teampages Inc., whether or not referred to directly as Active, as well as mobile versions thereof and social networking service pages and applications (collectively, the “Site”), and (b) any and all services available on or through the Site (the “Services”). By accessing and/or using the Site, you are expressly agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Use and any other policies, rules or guidelines that may be applicable to Services on the Site (“Additional Terms”), as well as all applicable laws and regulations. Further, you acknowledge that you have read and understood Active’s Privacy Policy located at: https://www.activenetwork.com/information/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which you understand will apply to the processing of your personal information in relation to the Site and the Services. Active may revise and update these Terms of Use at any time; please periodically review them, because your continued usage of the Site indicates your agreement with any such changes. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon notice, which we may provide by any means including, without limitation, posting a revised version of these Terms of Use on the Site. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will endeavor to notify you in advance of such change, by highlighting the change on the Sites or by sending an email to you at the email address that you have registered with us. You can determine when these Terms of Use were last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms of Use. You should return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Terms of Use. To the extent that there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Additional Terms for an event, camp, license, class, ticket, contest, permit, facility/equipment reservation, transaction, sale, membership, reservation, donation, and/or activity for which you are using the Site to register or purchase (each, an “Event”), the Additional Terms of use shall govern. These Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under these Terms of Use, including any indemnification obligations, warranties, and limitations of liability. ‍By using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that (i) you are a resident of the United States and are at least 16 years of age or, if under the age of 16, your parent has consented to your use of the Site via our consent mechanism as provided to your parent, or (ii) you are not a resident of the United States and are at least 18 years of age or, if under the age of 18, you have the consent of your parent or guardian (over the age of 18) to use the Site.

Active's use of your registration data, together with other personal information, is addressed in the Privacy Policy. ‍To the extent permissible by law, we are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password due to your failure to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of your registration, your disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password. If you have reason to believe that your registration is no longer secure, you must promptly change your password to the Site and immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@active.com.

Ownership and Restrictions on Use. ‍The information and materials provided on or through the Site, including any content, data, text, designs, graphics, images, photographs, illustrations, audio and video clips, logos, icons and links (collectively, the “Materials”) are owned exclusively by Active or its licensors, and are intended to educate and inform you about the events and other products and services offered or described on the Site.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, we grant you a limited license to use the Site and Materials for your personal use only; provided that you may not use, reproduce, modify, display, publicly perform, distribute, create derivative works of or circumvent any technological measure that effectively controls access to the Site and/or Materials in any way including, without limitation, by manual or automatic device or process, for any purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights not specifically granted in the license set forth above shall be reserved and remain always with Active. Use of the Site and Materials for any purpose other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use is a violation of our copyrights and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. The Site, including all Site software, databases, proprietary information, documentation, software, contents, computer codes, ideas, know-how and Materials (and all modifications and derivative works thereof and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto or contained therein) including, without limitation, the selection, compilations, sequence and “look and feel” and arrangement of items, is owned and operated by Active and will remain the exclusive property of Active. You acknowledge that the Site is protected by copyright, trademark and other laws. You further acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Materials. You shall not challenge, contest or otherwise impair Active’s ownership of the Site and the content therein.The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Site (collectively the “Trademarks”) are the registered and unregistered trademarks of Active and Active’s advertisers, licensors, suppliers and others. The Trademarks owned by Active, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not offered by Active, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any manner that disparages Active. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of Active, Active’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Misuse of any Trademarks is prohibited, and Active will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings. You may make comparative or other nominative fair use of Trademarks owned by Active in advertising and promotional materials, and in referring to Active’s products and services (for example, in a magazine article) without Active’s permission, provided you follow standard trademark usage practices and provide proper attribution to Active. Other uses that are not “fair use” require written permission from Active, and absent such express permission, you agree not to use or display the Trademarks owned by Active in any manner. Please make such requests by email to support@active.com; we will evaluate your request as soon as possible. Trademarks owned by Active include, without limitation, those published and searchable on the United States Patent and Trademark Office located at http://www.uspto.gov at “Trademarks Search” and the Canadian Trademark Office at: http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/cipo/welcome/welcom-e.html at “Trade-marks Database” indicating Active Network, LLC as the identified owner for conducting such search. 4. Making Purchases. ‍If you wish to purchase products or services or register for an Event described on the Site (each, a “Transaction”), you will be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that any such information will be treated by Active in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your Transactions. In addition to these Terms of Use, your Transaction shall be subject to any Additional Terms applicable to such services, features or purchases. Registration for Events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations. You acknowledge that complying with any such laws is your responsibility, and YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD US LIABLE FOR YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY LAW OR OUR FAILURE TO NOTIFY YOU OF, OR PROPERLY APPLY, ANY LAW. WE WILL COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAY PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US TO ASSIST IN ANY INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION THEY MAY CONDUCT. You represent and warrant that all information you provide, including but not limited to all information concerning your name, address, credit card number, and other identifying information of any nature will be true, complete and correct, and that you will update all information as it changes.

You further agree that you will not attempt to conceal your identity or location by using virtual private networks (""VPNs"") multiple Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses or email addresses. You grant Active the right to provide any information you submit to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.

Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to Active’s acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your event registration may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future purchases made on such credit card accounts and/or on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the Site. Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5. Information Provided by Active. ‍Although Active strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, the nature of the data and other information contained on the Site are subject to frequent change. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Active endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. In addition, portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various artists, sports teams and other persons. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement thereof, and Active expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing. 6. Forums and User Content. ‍Active and its designees may host message boards, blog feeds and other forums found on the Site (collectively, the “Forums”), and you may have the ability to provide or upload to the Site creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, content, audio recordings, videos, photographs, graphics, artwork or other copyrighted works and materials (collectively, “User Content”). By sending or transmitting User Content to Active, or by posting such User Content to any area of the Site, YOU GRANT US AND OUR DESIGNEES A PERPETUAL, WORLDWIDE, NON-EXCLUSIVE, UNLIMITED, TRANSFERABLE, FULLY SUBLICENSEABLE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), ASSIGNABLE, ROYALTY-FREE, FULLY PAID UP, IRREVOCABLE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO USE, REPRODUCE, DISTRIBUTE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), MODIFY, ADAPT, COMBINE WITH OTHER WORKS, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, PUBLICLY PERFORM, DISPLAY, STORE, DIGITALLY PERFORM, PUBLISH (ON THE SITE, ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE(S), IN PRINT, RADIO, TELEVISION OR ELSEWHERE), MAKE, HAVE MADE, SELL, OFFER FOR SALE, IMPORT AND COMMERCIALIZE USER CONTENT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, IN ANY MANNER AND CONTEXT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USAGE IN COMMERCIAL, ADVERTISING OR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS), NOW KNOWN OR IN THE FUTURE DISCOVERED, IN ACTIVE’S SOLE DISCRETION, IN ANY WAY, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA NOW KNOWN OR HEREINAFTER DISCOVERED, WITHOUT LIMITATION AND WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY. To the extent permitted by law, you specifically waive any “moral rights” in and to the User Content. The foregoing grant includes without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property in and to your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, none of the User Content will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any User Content. If you have any User Content that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it to the Site. ACTIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER’S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY USER CONTENT YOU POST TO THE SITE. If Active does decide, in its sole discretion, to attribute User Content to you, you hereby grant Active the right to use your member name with respect to such attribution, and hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive any claims (including, without limitation, any privacy or publicity rights claims) with respect to such use of your member name. For clarity, the foregoing license grant to Active does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to the material in your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You further acknowledge that Active (a) is under no obligation to post, display or otherwise use any User Content, and (b) has no obligation whatsoever to pay you any royalty or other amounts on any revenues or other consideration that Active receives directly or indirectly from the use or display of your User Content or otherwise from the exercise of Active’s rights granted under these Terms of Use. You hereby agree not to instigate, support, maintain, or authorize any action, claim, or lawsuit against Active or its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, or any other person, on the grounds that any use of User Content, or any derivative works thereof, infringe any of your rights as creator of the User Content, including, without limitation, trademark rights, copyrights, publicity rights, privacy rights and moral rights. Information on our Forums may be provided by our staff and other contributors, some of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with Active. You acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in our Forums and that people participating in such Forums occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, obscene, threatening, harassing or encourages any such conduct, or that otherwise violate any of the Codes of Conduct, and you hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Active with respect thereto. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the Site or Forums by third parties, whether such third parties are visitors to the Site, members of the Active community or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Active. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates, suppliers or agents be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information obtained through the Site. If notified by a user of User Content that allegedly does not conform to these Terms of Use, Active may in its sole discretion investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove the User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent and/or warrant that: (i) you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to the User Content and to grant the rights and licenses to Active under all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary or intellectual property rights in and to any and all User Content in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of such person in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use or, if such persons are minors, the written consent, release, and/or permission of such minor’s parent or legal guardian. You further understand that the internet has no geographical boundaries, and you therefore agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable User Content. You also agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to disclose such User Content and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Site properly; to protect ourselves, our sponsors and our members and visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. Active reserves the right to delete from the Site any User Content, postings or member names and will cooperate fully with any law enforcement officials and/or agencies in any investigation, up to and including complete and immediate termination of your registration and/or accounts with Active. You acknowledge that Active may or may not pre-screen User Content, but that Active and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any User Content that is available via the Site. Without limiting the foregoing, Active and its designees shall have the right to remove any User Content that violates these Terms of Use or is otherwise objectionable, as determined in their sole discretion. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any User Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such User Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any User Content created by Active or submitted to Active, including without limitation information in Active’s message boards and in all other parts of the Site. 7. Links. ‍As a convenience to our members, we may provide links to third-party web sites. If you use these links, you will leave the Site. Your dealings with third parties through links to such third party websites or applications are solely between you and such third party. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, Active is not responsible for the content, goods or services provided on or through such websites, any updates or changes to such sites, for your use or inability to use such sites, or the privacy or other practices of such sites, and the fact that Active offers such links does not indicate any approval or endorsement of any material contained on any linked site. The linked sites are not under our control, and we make no representations as to the quality, suitability, functionality or legality of any sites to which we may provide links. Active expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, legality, decency or accuracy of any information, and for any products and services, that appear on any third party website or application.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Further, you acknowledge that you have read and understood Active’s Privacy Policy located at: https://www.activenetwork.com/information/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which you understand will apply to the processing of your personal information in relation to the Site and the Services. Active may revise and update these Terms of Use at any time; please periodically review them, because your continued usage of the Site indicates your agreement with any such changes. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon notice, which we may provide by any means including, without limitation, posting a revised version of these Terms of Use on the Site. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will endeavor to notify you in advance of such change, by highlighting the change on the Sites or by sending an email to you at the email address that you have registered with us. You can determine when these Terms of Use were last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms of Use. You should return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under these Terms of Use, including any indemnification obligations, warranties, and limitations of liability. ‍By using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that (i) you are a resident of the United States and are at least 16 years of age or, if under the age of 16, your parent has consented to your use of the Site via our consent mechanism as provided to your parent, or (ii) you are not a resident of the United States and are at least 18 years of age or, if under the age of 18, you have the consent of your parent or guardian (over the age of 18) to use the Site.

Active's use of your registration data, together with other personal information, is addressed in the Privacy Policy. ‍To the extent permissible by law, we are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password due to your failure to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of your registration, your disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password. If you have reason to believe that your registration is no longer secure, you must promptly change your password to the Site and immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@active.com.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights not specifically granted in the license set forth above shall be reserved and remain always with Active. Use of the Site and Materials for any purpose other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use is a violation of our copyrights and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. The Site, including all Site software, databases, proprietary information, documentation, software, contents, computer codes, ideas, know-how and Materials (and all modifications and derivative works thereof and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto or contained therein) including, without limitation, the selection, compilations, sequence and “look and feel” and arrangement of items, is owned and operated by Active and will remain the exclusive property of Active. You acknowledge that the Site is protected by copyright, trademark and other laws. You further acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Materials. You shall not challenge, contest or otherwise impair Active’s ownership of the Site and the content therein.The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Site (collectively the “Trademarks”) are the registered and unregistered trademarks of Active and Active’s advertisers, licensors, suppliers and others. The Trademarks owned by Active, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not offered by Active, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any manner that disparages Active. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of Active, Active’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Misuse of any Trademarks is prohibited, and Active will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings. You may make comparative or other nominative fair use of Trademarks owned by Active in advertising and promotional materials, and in referring to Active’s products and services (for example, in a magazine article) without Active’s permission, provided you follow standard trademark usage practices and provide proper attribution to Active. Other uses that are not “fair use” require written permission from Active, and absent such express permission, you agree not to use or display the Trademarks owned by Active in any manner. Please make such requests by email to support@active.com; we will evaluate your request as soon as possible. Trademarks owned by Active include, without limitation, those published and searchable on the United States Patent and Trademark Office located at http://www.uspto.gov at “Trademarks Search” and the Canadian Trademark Office at: http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/cipo/welcome/welcom-e.html at “Trade-marks Database” indicating Active Network, LLC as the identified owner for conducting such search. 4. Making Purchases. ‍If you wish to purchase products or services or register for an Event described on the Site (each, a “Transaction”), you will be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that any such information will be treated by Active in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your Transactions. In addition to these Terms of Use, your Transaction shall be subject to any Additional Terms applicable to such services, features or purchases. Registration for Events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations.

Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.

Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to Active’s acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your event registration may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future purchases made on such credit card accounts and/or on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the Site. Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5. Information Provided by Active. ‍Although Active strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, the nature of the data and other information contained on the Site are subject to frequent change. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Active endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. In addition, portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various artists, sports teams and other persons. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement thereof, and Active expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing. 6. Forums and User Content. ‍Active and its designees may host message boards, blog feeds and other forums found on the Site (collectively, the “Forums”), and you may have the ability to provide or upload to the Site creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, content, audio recordings, videos, photographs, graphics, artwork or other copyrighted works and materials (collectively, “User Content”). By sending or transmitting User Content to Active, or by posting such User Content to any area of the Site, YOU GRANT US AND OUR DESIGNEES A PERPETUAL, WORLDWIDE, NON-EXCLUSIVE, UNLIMITED, TRANSFERABLE, FULLY SUBLICENSEABLE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), ASSIGNABLE, ROYALTY-FREE, FULLY PAID UP, IRREVOCABLE RIGHT AND LICENSE TO USE, REPRODUCE, DISTRIBUTE (THROUGH MULTIPLE TIERS), MODIFY, ADAPT, COMBINE WITH OTHER WORKS, CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF, PUBLICLY PERFORM, DISPLAY, STORE, DIGITALLY PERFORM, PUBLISH (ON THE SITE, ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE(S), IN PRINT, RADIO, TELEVISION OR ELSEWHERE), MAKE, HAVE MADE, SELL, OFFER FOR SALE, IMPORT AND COMMERCIALIZE USER CONTENT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, IN ANY MANNER AND CONTEXT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USAGE IN COMMERCIAL, ADVERTISING OR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS), NOW KNOWN OR IN THE FUTURE DISCOVERED, IN ACTIVE’S SOLE DISCRETION, IN ANY WAY, IN ANY AND ALL MEDIA NOW KNOWN OR HEREINAFTER DISCOVERED, WITHOUT LIMITATION AND WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY. To the extent permitted by law, you specifically waive any “moral rights” in and to the User Content. The foregoing grant includes without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property in and to your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, none of the User Content will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any User Content. If you have any User Content that you would like to keep confidential and/or do not want others to use, do not post it to the Site. ACTIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER’S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY USER CONTENT YOU POST TO THE SITE. If Active does decide, in its sole discretion, to attribute User Content to you, you hereby grant Active the right to use your member name with respect to such attribution, and hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive any claims (including, without limitation, any privacy or publicity rights claims) with respect to such use of your member name. For clarity, the foregoing license grant to Active does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to the material in your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You further acknowledge that Active (a) is under no obligation to post, display or otherwise use any User Content, and (b) has no obligation whatsoever to pay you any royalty or other amounts on any revenues or other consideration that Active receives directly or indirectly from the use or display of your User Content or otherwise from the exercise of Active’s rights granted under these Terms of Use. You hereby agree not to instigate, support, maintain, or authorize any action, claim, or lawsuit against Active or its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, or any other person, on the grounds that any use of User Content, or any derivative works thereof, infringe any of your rights as creator of the User Content, including, without limitation, trademark rights, copyrights, publicity rights, privacy rights and moral rights. Information on our Forums may be provided by our staff and other contributors, some of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with Active. You acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in our Forums and that people participating in such Forums occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, obscene, threatening, harassing or encourages any such conduct, or that otherwise violate any of the Codes of Conduct, and you hereby completely and irrevocably release and forever discharge us from and waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Active with respect thereto. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the Site or Forums by third parties, whether such third parties are visitors to the Site, members of the Active community or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Active. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates, suppliers or agents be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information obtained through the Site. If notified by a user of User Content that allegedly does not conform to these Terms of Use, Active may in its sole discretion investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove the User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent and/or warrant that: (i) you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to the User Content and to grant the rights and licenses to Active under all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary or intellectual property rights in and to any and all User Content in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Content to use the name or likeness of such person in the manner contemplated by the Site and these Terms of Use or, if such persons are minors, the written consent, release, and/or permission of such minor’s parent or legal guardian. You further understand that the internet has no geographical boundaries, and you therefore agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable User Content. You also agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to disclose such User Content and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Site properly; to protect ourselves, our sponsors and our members and visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. Active reserves the right to delete from the Site any User Content, postings or member names and will cooperate fully with any law enforcement officials and/or agencies in any investigation, up to and including complete and immediate termination of your registration and/or accounts with Active.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Charges and Billing. The Site may require payment of access fees. By registering for the Site, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service, purchase or registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the Transaction, Service or Event for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired, otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. You shall additionally be responsible for and shall immediately pay Active, on demand, any payments that are made to us that are subject to an unjustified, subsequent reversal. Unless indicated otherwise, all fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars. Active reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the Site. Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties.

In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction.

You understand and agree that in Active’s sole discretion, and without prior notice, Active may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Active’s other services, cancel your event registration, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Active believes may be associated with you, cancel an event registration associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized User Content or exercise any other remedy available, if Active believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Active believes you act in concert, or the User Content you provide, or any resale of such event registrations purchased through Active, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms of Use or the law, or violates the rights of Active, a customer of Active or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Active for violations of these Terms of Use and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations. You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information.

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website. Unique device identifiers like IP address or UDID recognize a visitor’s computer or other device used to access the internet. Unique device identifiers are used alone and in conjunction with cookies and other tracking technologies for the purpose of “remembering” computers or other devices used to access the Sites and Apps. Cookies can be classified by duration and by source: Duration. The Sites use both “session” and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary - they terminate when you close your browser or otherwise end your “active” browsing session. Persistent cookies remember you on subsequent visits. Persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, and they will remain on your computer or other device unless you choose to delete them (see below for “How to Delete or Block Cookies”). Source. Cookies can be “first-party” or “third-party” cookies, which means that they are either issued by or on behalf of Active or by a third-party operator of another website. For an example of a third-party cookie, our Sites may contain a Facebook “like” button, which would set a cookie that can be read by Facebook. Our Sites may use both first-party and third-party cookies. The cookies that we may use on the Sites fall into the following categories: Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions taken by you such as logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but blocking them may impede the functionality of the Sites. Performance Cookies. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance. Functionality Cookies. These cookies enable the Sites to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some of these services may not function properly. Targeting Cookies. Active does not set targeting cookies on our End User facing Sites where this Notice is posted. However, our Customers may set these cookies on End User facing Sites for their own purposes and subject to their own privacy policy. On our Customer facing Sites only, we may set targeting cookies. These cookies may be set through our Sites by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites, including social media platforms. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. How to Delete or Block Cookies ‍On some Sites, when technically feasible, we will enable tools to help you make choices about cookies. You may also delete or block cookies at any time by changing your browser settings. You can click “Help” in the toolbar of your browser for instruction or review the cookie management guide produced by the Interactive Advertising Bureau available at www.allaboutcookies.org. If you delete or block cookies, some features of the Sites may not function properly. ‍External Links ‍ ‍Active may include links to other websites that are not under Active’s control.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change any portion of this Notice, in whole or in part, at any time. When we amend this Notice, we will revise the “last updated” date located at the top of the document. We will also take reasonable steps to ensure you are made aware of any material updates including providing you direct communication about such changes or providing a notification through the Services, as appropriate. If you provide personal information to us or access or use the Services after this Notice has been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally consented and agreed to such changes. The most current version of this Notice will be available on the Sites and Apps and will supersede all previous versions of this Notice. ‍Choice of Law. This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com. ‍ CONTACT US ‍ If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly.

Further, you acknowledge that you have read and understood Active’s Privacy Policy located at: https://www.activenetwork.com/information/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which you understand will apply to the processing of your personal information in relation to the Site and the Services. Active may revise and update these Terms of Use at any time; please periodically review them, because your continued usage of the Site indicates your agreement with any such changes. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon notice, which we may provide by any means including, without limitation, posting a revised version of these Terms of Use on the Site. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will endeavor to notify you in advance of such change, by highlighting the change on the Sites or by sending an email to you at the email address that you have registered with us.

Active's use of your registration data, together with other personal information, is addressed in the Privacy Policy. ‍To the extent permissible by law, we are not liable for any harm caused or related to the theft or misappropriation of your user name or password due to your failure to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of your registration, your disclosure of your user name or password, or your authorization of anyone else to use your user name or password.

Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel your account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee. You agree to pay your account balance on time. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your Transaction or use of the Service. Amounts not paid by you to Active when due will be assessed an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than thirty (30) days past due. That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys’ and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. These Terms of Use shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active. You also understand and agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must notify Active of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement. If you do not notify Active within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. Parties other than Active provide services, or sell products or access to their Events on the Site. You may order services or merchandise through the Site from other parties not affiliated with Active (“Seller”). All matters concerning the merchandise and services desired from a Seller, including but not limited to purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between you and Seller. Active makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Active, nor will Active be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Active may have received some form of revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Active will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals. Active does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. It is the responsibility of the Event organizer to communicate its refund policy to you and to issue refunds to you via the Site or otherwise. You understand and agree that Event organizers reserve the right to cancel Events for various reasons, including, without limitation, in the event of weather events (including, but not limited to, heat, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, storms, lightning and floods), accidents, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts or riots or for any reason that would affect the safety and security of Event participants and spectators. In the event of such cancellation, there will be no refund of your payment unless authorized by the Event organizer. If you want to request a refund, you must request the refund directly from the Event organizer. To the extent that an Event is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Event organizer and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Event is with the Event organizer and not with Active. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Event organizer and you. Active will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds or lack of refunds in connection with an Event. In addition, Active is not responsible for the truth or accuracy of any listings by Event organizers or the ability of any Event organizer to perform, hold an Event, or complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of Event organizers and/or third parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may investigate the claim and take action. Donations. When you make a donation, Active receives a fee for the use of our technology without any additional charge to you. Donations collected by Active will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and applicable law, less Active’s fee. Any refunds shall be exclusively and directly handled by the designated charitable organization. Active shall not be responsible for processing or making any refunds. 5.

You understand and agree that in Active’s sole discretion, and without prior notice, Active may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Active’s other services, cancel your event registration, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Active believes may be associated with you, cancel an event registration associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized User Content or exercise any other remedy available, if Active believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Active believes you act in concert, or the User Content you provide, or any resale of such event registrations purchased through Active, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms of Use or the law, or violates the rights of Active, a customer of Active or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place event registrations that exceed the stated limit will be deemed to be a material violation of these Terms of Use. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Active for violations of these Terms of Use and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations. You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Active in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site.

Accordingly, you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1,000 during that twenty-four hour period. You acknowledge that: (a) Active has a valid interest in ensuring proper use of the Site; (b) this provision is reasonably tailored to that purpose; and (c) that the liquidated damages amount is a reasonable approximation of the costs and damages that Active would incur as a result of such action by you or others acting in concert with you. Active is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms of Use or any of Active’s rights. Additionally, Active reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you. Active also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to impose limits on certain features and services and to restrict access to the Site without notice to you.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.

Active provides activity and participant management solutions (our “Services”) that enable nonprofits, universities, state and local agencies, and other organizations (our “Customers”) to manage the events, camps, and classes, or other programs they offer to individuals (“End Users”). In this Privacy Notice (“Notice”), we describe how we collect, use, and share personal information about our Customers and End Users through the Services, websites (“Sites”), and mobile applications (“Apps”) where this Notice is posted. We may provide additional privacy policies as necessary that apply to your use of certain products. This Notice applies to the Services as provided by Active on its own behalf or in combination with one of its parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT Active collects two different categories of personal information when Customers and End Users interact with Active: The personal information of our Customers or potential customers of Active (“Customer Information”), and The personal information of End Users who use Active to register with our Customers (“End User Information”). Active uses these categories of personal information differently because while we have a direct relationship with our Customers and therefore may determine why and how to handle Customer Information, our relationship with End Users is indirect and based on our relationship with our Customer. We only handle End User Information in accordance with our Customer’s instructions. If you are an End User who has a relationship with one of our Customers and have a question about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared, or would like to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your personal information, please contact the Customer directly.

Sources of personal information. We collect personal information from the following sources: Information that you provide to us: We collect personal information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us. For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your name, contact information and payment information. Providing us with personal information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services' features. Information collected from third parties: We may collect information about you from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you. For example, we may collect personal information like your name, contact information and enrollment status from the Customer you are registering with to offer the Services to you. Information collected through technology: When you visit our Sites or Apps (or when you use any of our Services) we may collect certain information about your location, usage, computer or device through technology such as cookies (see below for more information on cookies). Data anonymization and aggregation. Subject to your consent if required by law, we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymized or aggregated data. For example, we may use anonymized or aggregated data for statistical analysis including to analyze trends, for product development, and for risk assessments and cost analysis. We may share anonymized or aggregated data with our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or with other third parties. This Notice does not restrict Active’s use or sharing of any non-personal, summarized, derived, anonymized or aggregated information. ‍ HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION ‍For each category of personal information we collect, we share such information in the manner and for the purposes described below: With Active affiliates where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. With third-party service providers. For example, we share personal information with IT service providers who help manage our back office systems or administer our Sites and Apps. These third-party service providers have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us. With our Customer with whom you are also engaging when you use the Services. For example, you may be using an Active Service provided to you through one of our Customer’s (for example, a city) websites, to engage in a purchase or sign up for a class. Active may share the personal information you provide with the city in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications from the city. Each such Customer operates independently from Active and their collection and use of your personal information is not subject to this Notice but to their own privacy notices. With banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments. On Customer facing Sites only, we may share with advertising or social media networks for personalized marketing purposes (See “Cookies” for additional information”). Active does not sell your personal information to third parties. Active may also disclose personal information about you if it believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Active, users of the Services or any person including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use. In addition, subject to applicable legal requirements, we may share personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business assets to another company. ‍ TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY ‍ We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States or in another country outside of the country in which you reside, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. ‍ Privacy Shield. In addition to using a separate, valid E.U. data transfer mechanism as described in this Notice, Active also participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about Privacy Shield, visit www.privacyshield.gov. Active is responsible for both its processing of personal information and subsequent transfers to any third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Active complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Active is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Active may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Residents of the European Union and of Switzerland have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to ensure adequate protection of personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed adequately, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider at: https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, described in full on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. ‍ HOW WE PROTECT AND DISPOSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION We take seriously our responsibility to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Any suspected attempt to breach our policies and procedures, or to engage in any type of unauthorized action involving our information systems, is regarded as potential criminal activity.

However, like all website operators, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted through the internet. When we no longer need your personal information to provide the Services, it will be securely deleted or de-identified in a manner that ensures you cannot be re-identified. ‍ COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ‍A “cookie” is a text file that is stored to your browser when you visit a website.

This Notice, including all revisions and amendments thereto, is governed by the laws of the United States, State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles which would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. ‍Arbitration. By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Active and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the ""Active Entities"") arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Notice and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Active Entity's individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Active Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Global Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Active agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Active will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Active shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Arbitration Agreement. ‍(a) Except as prohibited by law, each party to these Terms of Use agrees that any claim, controversy or legal dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (hereinafter, a “Dispute” ) will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If JAMS is not available in the state or jurisdiction in which you reside, then the Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA” ). This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, all of which shall be considered within the definition of “Dispute.” THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES. However, Active may not invoke its right to arbitrate any individual claim that you bring in small claims court, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Each party agrees that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” ). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: Chief Legal Officer, c/o Active Network, LLC, 717 North Harwood Street, Suite 2500, Dallas, TX 75201 ( “Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled. After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee up to $350, unless your claim is for greater than $50,000 (as described further below). (c) The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 15. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection (d) below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $50,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration (i.e. the JAMS filing and administration fee and the arbitrator’s fee) up to $350 for an arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration agreement. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $50,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. (d) Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Dispute is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by, if your billing address is in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise, by the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. By way of example only (and not by limitation), if the parties do not agree on whether a particular Dispute is subject to arbitration under this arbitration agreement, the proper tribunal to decide such Dispute is the United States District Court (for the appropriate district, as provided above) or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in that United States District Court, in the appropriate state court (as described above). The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection (d). The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection (d). Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein. (e) WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS: You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Dispute will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection (e) is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. (f) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Texas state law and procedures concerning arbitration shall apply to these Terms of Use only to the extent that they do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with the FAA. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. (g) Unless both parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the Dallas, Texas, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. Subject to the terms of this arbitration agreement, all Disputes shall be decided by a single arbitrator, who shall be either: (1) a retired federal judge; (2) a retired state court judge who sat on a trial court or appellate court for at least five (5) years; or (3) an attorney admitted to practice in the state in which the Dispute will be resolved for at least twenty-five (25) years with no disciplinary history. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify JAMS (or the AAA, as applicable) and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted. (h) This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration. Any Dispute that is not arbitrated, including any judicial action to enforce this arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in, if you reside in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, or otherwise in the United States District Court for the federal district in which you reside, and the parties hereby consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court; provided that if that United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such disagreement or dispute shall be resolved by the state court of general jurisdiction embracing the area in which you reside. (i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; provided, however, that in no event shall the right to discovery granted to the parties to these Terms of Use exceed ten (10) interrogatories, twelve (12) documents requests, two third-party subpoenas, and one deposition (of not more than four hours), per side. The parties may submit such pre-arbitration and post-arbitration briefs (including briefs during arbitration) as they choose, provided that no party shall submit briefing exceeding a reasonable page limitation to be set by the arbitrator. In the event any party submits a motion, the arbitrator shall consider the motion and either deny it or request opposition briefing by the non-moving party, which shall not be required until requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not grant a motion without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to oppose. The total length of the arbitration hearings on the merits shall not exceed 10 hours of hearing time, to be divided equally between the opposing sides. All discovery shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The hearing shall be concluded no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after appointment of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator’s schedule requires a later hearing. The arbitrator may only extend these limits at the request of a party when the arbitrator finds exceptional cause for the extension. The parties may extend these limits by mutual agreement. (j) The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings, conclusions and a statement of award. Except as set forth herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. 16.
