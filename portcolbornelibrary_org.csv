We have joined LiNC November 23, 2020November 25, 2020 admin The Port Colborne Public Library (PCPL) has now joined the Libraries in Niagara Cooperative (LiNC). PCPL patrons are now able to use their library card at different member libraries in the Niagara Region and have access to many more books via our resource sharing program. The following libraries are part of LiNC: Grimsby Public Library Lincoln Public Library West Lincoln Public Library Pelham Public Library Thorold Public Library Niagara-on-the-Lake Public Library Fort Erie Public Library Niagara College Library Welland Public Library Port Colborne Public Library What is LiNC? The Libraries in Niagara Cooperative (LiNC) was established in 2010. This cooperative library consortium, consisting of multiple Niagara public libraries and one college library, was created to share an open source library catalogue system called Evergreen. It eliminates the need for individual LiNC member libraries to select, mount, manage and upgrade a singly owned library system. What does being a LiNC patron mean? LiNC is a collaborative venture and succeeds due to the efforts of its members. LiNC’s integrated library system is housed and managed in one location, and LiNC’s libraries contribute annually to costs associated with the integrated library system. Costs to manage a comparable proprietary system would be significantly more. As a LiNC member, Port Colborne Public Library patrons will have: Access to thousands of more books via resource sharing Access to a brand new interactive online catalogue *Note: You can choose to search just your home library, or the entire LiNC catalogue The ability to check out items at any member library *Note: Just present your PCPL card at any member branch The ability to place holds on any applicable item in the LiNC catalogue from any member library *Note: If you place a hold on another library’s item, you would have to travel there to pick it up when is ready. Hold transits are currently unavailable. The ability to pay fines at any member branch The ability to create reading lists and track reading history Your PCPL account As we transition to the new system, some PCPL patron account information will be transferred over, and some will not. The following account information will be transferred: Currently checked out items Current holds (no need to resubmit hold requests) Account details such as address, contact information, etc. The following account information will not be transferred: Reading lists Reading history If you sign into your account on Evergreen, in Preferences, you will be able to select 🗹 Keep borrowing history and 󠆱🗹 Keep hold history.
